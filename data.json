      "content": "1 Brilliant Vanguard Index Fund to Buy Before It Soars 25%, According to Wall Street Analysts David Dierking, The Motley Fool Fri, February 20, 2026 at 9:20 AM PST 3 min read NVDA INTC For the first time in more than three years, investors are giving an extended look to areas of the market beyond tech. Energy and consumer staples are among the best-performing sectors this year. Value and dividend stocks have made a comeback. International equities have been on a tear since the beginning of 2025. Another category that's had a strong start to the year is small caps. Long unloved and ignored, they're getting attention for their comparatively small exposure to tech and attractive valuations. The Russell 2000, a generally accepted benchmark for small caps, is receiving some eye-catching price targets from analysts. Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » The ETF Action database, which compiles price targets for companies within a particular ETF, currently has a 25% 12-month upside target for the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF (NASDAQ: VTWO) . Let's break down the investment case for this fund heading into the remainder of 2026. Image source: Getty Images. Why Wall Street is turning bullish on small caps again Even though small caps are considered riskier and have more boom/bust potential than large caps , there comes a point where the value and the narrative are impossible to ignore. For example: Valuation concerns about megacaps, potential rate cuts, and a deregulation tailwind would all benefit small caps. Currently, the Russell 2000 is expected  to grow 2026 earnings by 19% compared to a 13% growth forecast for the S&P 500 . The Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF has a price/earnings (P/E) ratio of 18 versus 28 for the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF . It's not often that the value and growth stories both line up for small caps, but that's happening now. And the market has begun to recognize it. Why the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF is positioned for the next leg Megacaps have dominated the U.S. equity market for years, but concentration risk is beginning to rise. The same \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that have pulled the major market averages higher are all down year-to-date as of Feb. 13, and they're all down more than 10% from their all-time highs. Tech has become an anchor this year. Small companies tend to disproportionately benefit from lower interest rates because many carry higher debt loads. Current rate-cut expectations are modest, but any unexpected disinflation, growth, or labor market shock could quickly have the Federal Reserve thinking about more rate cuts. Story Continues But if the U.S. economy can maintain a \"soft landing\" or \"no landing\" outcome, small caps could find additional momentum. For years, investors were interested only in the growth stories being offered by large-cap and megacap stocks. The next phase of the market cycle could finally reward the small caps.

Q4 revenue climbed 12% year-over-year to $1.1 billion, driven by a 17% surge in order entries across the banking and retail sectors. The company’s strategic focus on modular retail solutions and ATM recycling technology has led to significant market gains, including nine new major retail logos in the US grocery and pharmacy sectors. While operating expenses rose by 3.7% due to labor costs and investments in service infrastructure, management noted that the rollout of new field service software is largely complete, positioning the company for margin expansion starting in Q2 2026. Despite a slight decline in retail margins caused by external cyber-related disruptions, the banking segment remains robust with strong branch automation demand in North America and a recovery expected in Latin America. Diebold Nixdorf enters 2026 with a solid $730 million product backlog and anticipates revenue growth to be weighted toward H2 of the year. The CEO emphasized that the company remains disciplined in its capital allocation, prioritizing shareholder returns through buybacks while evaluating tuck-in acquisitions that could immediately bolster its service capabilities and global footprint.

(NASDAQ: RELY ) is one of the best new tech stocks to invest in now . On February 18, Remitly Global recorded revenue of $1.635 billion in the full year 2025, which was a 29% increase year-over-year. Q4 was particularly strong with $442 million in revenue and $41 million in net income, driven by a 19% increase in active users to over 9 million. A significant highlight was the surge in high-value transactions, with volume from very high amount senders skyrocketing 105% in the quarter. The company is undergoing a major leadership transition as co-founder Matt Oppenheimer steps into the role of Executive Chairman, passing the CEO mantle to former Amazon and Apple executive Sebastian Gunningham. This shift comes as Remitly scales its product ecosystem through new offerings like Flex, which is a send-now-pay-later service that has already surpassed 120,000 users. Furthermore, the launch of Remitly Business and the integration of advanced AI fraud models have improved operational efficiency, leading to record-low transaction losses and a tripled free cash flow of $283 million for the year.

On February 4, Ralliant reported Q4 2025 revenue of $555 million, which was only a 1% increase year-over-year but exceeded company guidance. Growth was uneven across segments: while the Communications division surged by 29% and Sensors & Safety Systems grew 6%, the Test & Measurement segment saw a 6% decline as customers remained cautious with capital expenditure. The company faced a significant financial setback during the quarter, recording a $1.4 billion non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to its EA Elektro-Automatik business. Management attributed this write-down to a cooling in EV demand and shifts in global subsidies. Additionally, Ralliant is navigating structural cost headwinds following its recent spin-off, which are expected to impact adjusted EBITDA margins by 250 basis points in 2026. Ralliant issued full-year revenue guidance of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.22 to $2.42 for 2026. While the Test & Measurement segment is expected to remain at the lower end of growth expectations, the company remains committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy that balances organic investment in AI and digital platforms with strategic tuck-in acquisitions.

DATE Friday, Feb. 20, 2026 at 11 a.m. ET CALL PARTICIPANTS President and Chief Executive Officer — Katherine Holt Antonello Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer — Michael Aldo Pedraja Full Conference Call Transcript Katherine Holt Antonello: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2025 earnings call. Joining me is Michael Aldo Pedraja, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, I will begin by providing highlights of our fourth quarter 2025 results and then hand it over to Michael for more details on our financials. Before our Q&A, I will come back to you with some additional thoughts. I would like to begin with how we are actively addressing the elevated frequency of California cumulative trauma claims. To be clear, this remains a California-specific issue. Claim frequency in our other states and within non-CT claims in California continues to trend favorably. We recognized early that the CT environment was creating a hard market in California, and we moved decisively, have implemented rate increases, and tightened underwriting on several classes of business. We are not waiting for legislative reform, though we do believe the growing impact on California businesses and public budgets will make the case for reform increasingly difficult to ignore. While we are confident that these California pricing and underwriting actions, along with the steps we are taking across the country, will strengthen our underwriting profitability, they are also likely to reduce written premium in 2026. It is worth highlighting that our small commercial franchise maintained strong retention rates throughout 2025, a clear sign the investments we have made in automation and ease of use are genuinely resonating. I am also pleased to report that our standard fourth quarter full actuarial assessment concluded that no additional reserve strengthening or adjustments to our current accident year loss and LAE ratio was necessary. In addition to our internal analysis, we engaged a market-leading actuarial firm to independently assess our estimated ultimate loss, and they concluded that our carried reserves were well within the range of reasonable estimates. We believe the outcome of these two analyses confirms the actions we took in the third quarter adequately addressed recent workers’ compensation trends. I am excited to discuss our new workers’ compensation product, which represents a strategic expansion of our capabilities. By leveraging our core workers’ compensation expertise into the excess layer, we are creating new growth avenues while diversifying our risk profile. Our aggressive adoption of AI tools has accelerated the product’s development, and I am pleased to report that we are now accepting submissions. The early market response has been strong, and we expect this product will deepen our distribution partner relationships while expanding our addressable market. Story Continues We continued to execute on our commitment to returning capital to stockholders by delivering $215,000,000 of share repurchases and regular quarterly dividends in 2025. In January, we completed the $125,000,000 capital recapitalization plan that we announced in the third quarter. These capital management steps reflect our continued confidence in our financial position and our commitment to delivering value to shareholders. Along with our operational performance, these actions increased our book value per share, including the gain, by 11% to $51.31. We believe our focus on disciplined underwriting, prudent risk management, and strategic investments continues to position us strongly in the workers’ compensation insurance market, which is evidenced by A.M. Best’s recent reaffirmation of our insurance companies’ financial strength rating of A. With that, Michael will now provide a deeper dive into our fourth quarter financial results, and then I will return to provide my closing remarks. Michael? Michael Aldo Pedraja: Thank you, Katherine. Gross premiums written were $156,800,000 compared to $176,300,000 for the prior-year quarter, a decrease of 11% due primarily to a decrease in new business writings and lower final audit premiums, partially offset by higher renewal business premium. Our losses and LAE were $134,400,000 versus $113,200,000 a year ago, an increase of 18.7% due primarily to an increase in the accident year 2025 selected loss and LAE ratio and the absence of favorable developments in the fourth quarter of this year. Commission expense was $25,800,000 for the quarter versus $24,400,000 for the prior year, an increase of 5.7% driven by nonrecurring adjustments. Underwriting expenses were $39,800,000 for the quarter versus $44,200,000 for the prior year, a decrease of 10%. The improvement in underwriting expenses for the fourth quarter was due primarily to continued expense management efforts, including reduced personnel costs and other variable costs, such as policyholder dividends and bad debt. Net investment income was $31,400,000 for the quarter compared to $26,700,000 for the prior year, an increase of 17.6%, due mostly to private equity investment return distributions and an overall higher book yield on our fixed income portfolio. As Katherine mentioned, we executed an investment rebalancing to address several strategic goals, including reducing our equity investment allocation to target levels and increasing our overall portfolio yield. Our equity investments, like most in the market, have appreciated very nicely and reached 16% of our investment portfolio versus a target allocation of approximately 10%. As part of the investment rebalancing, we also sold low-yielding fixed income securities to offset the associated equity gains and redeploy the proceeds into higher-yielding fixed income investments. The investment rebalancing accomplished several goals, including reducing our equity investments to target allocation, increasing our overall investment portfolio yield by a net 40 basis points, extracting an estimated net present value gain of $16,000,000, and reducing our required capital. The sale of fixed income investments produced an after-tax realized loss of $40,000,000, which reduced net income and adjusted book value per share during the quarter. Our stockholders’ equity and book value per share were not impacted by the investment rebalancing. Our fixed maturities maintain a modified duration of 4.4 with strong average credit quality of A+. Aided by our investment rebalancing, our weighted average book yield increased to 4.9% at quarter end compared to 4.5% for the prior year. Our adjusted net income, which excludes net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses and the benefit of our LPT deferred gain amortization, was $14,500,000 for the quarter, compared to $28,700,000 last year. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased almost 2,400,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $40.94 per share, or $97,000,000. The average repurchase price represented a 20% discount to our book value per share, including the deferred gain, and adjusted book value per share. During the period from January 1 through February 18 of this year, the company repurchased a further 898,594 shares of its common stock at an average price of $44.28 per share. Our remaining share repurchase authorization is $53,100,000. As we have highlighted, we aim to be good stewards of our shareholders’ capital. At current price levels, we are convinced that the Employers Holdings, Inc. stock is meaningfully undervalued, and executing share repurchases at these price levels produces a significant return on investment and generates significant value for our continuing shareholders. I will now turn the call back to Katherine. Katherine Holt Antonello: Thank you, Michael. Yesterday, our Boa",

(NYSE: FIG ) is one of the best new tech stocks to invest in now . On February 18, Figma reported the financial results for Q4 2025, with revenue reaching $304 million, marking a 40% increase year-over-year. For the full year, the company surpassed $1 billion, generating $1.056 billion in total revenue. This growth was supported by a net dollar retention rate of 136% among customers with over $10,000 in ARR and international expansion, which grew 45% compared to the previous year. The company is prioritizing AI-native functionality to drive user engagement and expand its customer base. The CEO highlighted the success of Figma Make and the integration of AI credits, noting that 75% of large customers are already using these credits weekly. However, Figma also anticipates that its non-GAAP operating margin will decrease from 12% in 2025 to 8% in 2026. This is attributed to increased investments in AI infrastructure, elevated stock-based compensation following its IPO, and the costs associated with transitioning to a hybrid monetization model involving both seats and AI credits. Figma provided Q1 2026 revenue guidance of $315 to $317 million and full-year guidance of approximately $1.37 billion.

      "content": "Tax refunds are big this year, IRS data show. Here's how big. Medora Lee, USA TODAY Fri, February 20, 2026 at 9:13 AM PST 4 min read The number of tax returns the IRS has received so far this tax season is down from last year, but refunds are up double digits, IRS data show. The average refund through Feb. 6 was $2,290, up nearly 11% from $2,065 at the same time in 2025 while total returns received fell 5.2%. The IRS noted refund numbers should rise further, too, as refunds claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) are required by law to be held until Feb. 15. These “refund numbers do not include millions of EITC and ACTC refunds to these taxpayers,” the agency said in its release. “This means the refund numbers expected to be released Feb. 27, for refunds processed through Feb. 20, are expected to be higher.” That should be encouraging news to Americans who are struggling under the weight of elevated prices and a slowing job market , analysts said. “Higher refunds should be a tailwind for consumers, particularly lower income consumers who use tax refunds for debt paydown and big-ticket purchases,” said Mihir Bhatia, analyst at Bank of America. Average refunds are big. How to get mine faster? \"Combining direct deposit with electronic filing is the fastest way to receive your refund ,\" the IRS said. Most refunds are issued in less than 21 days for taxpayers who filed a flawless return electronically and chose direct deposit. Nine out of 10 taxpayers already receive their tax refunds by direct deposit, but to boost that closer to 100%, the IRS began phasing out paper checks last September. \"Paper checks are over 16 times more likely to be lost, stolen, altered, or delayed than electronic payments,\" the IRS said. \"Direct deposit also avoids the possibility that a refund check could be returned to the IRS as undeliverable.\" How do I know when my refund’s coming? Through the IRS \" Where's My Refund \" tool, you can track when the IRS received your tax return, when it approved a refund and when it issued the refund. The money should land in your account within five days from the date the IRS approves your refund. If you mailed a paper return and expect a refund, it could take four weeks or more to process your return, the IRS said. Since refunds for Americans who claimed the EITC/ACTC can’t be released until mid-February for early filers , those taxpayers may have to wait until around March 3 to see their refunds in their bank accounts or on debit cards, if they chose direct deposit and there are no issues with the tax return. If you don’t have a bank account, find one through the FDIC website or the National Credit Union Administration using their Credit Union Locator Tool . Usually, people can open a b a nk account pretty quickly. You can also ask your tax preparer if they offer other electronic payment options. Story Continues Otherwise, you might be able to deposit your refund onto a reloadable prepaid debit card or mobile app. Many reloadable prepaid cards and mobile apps have routing and account numbers, which may be different from the card number. Check with your financial institution to make sure your card or app can receive the deposit and double-check the routing and account numbers. Tax filers saw $172.26 billion in federal income tax refunds head their way through March 24. While that's a great deal of money, the total dollar amount is down $16.4 billion or down 8.7% from a year ago. Tax refunds How should people use their tax refunds? Along with that big check comes big responsibility, so make sure not to spend it all away , financial experts said. Here are some ideas : Since refunds are expected to be larger than usual , splitting a refund can be a convenient way to manage your money. You can split the refund in any proportion you want, sending some to an account for immediate use and some for future savings, in up to three different accounts with U.S. financial institutions, reloadable prepaid debit cards, or mobile apps.  You can use your tax software to do it electronically or use IRS Form 8888, Allocation of Refund if you file a paper return. Plan how to use the refund before receiving it. This “reduces overspending risk by assigning the refund a job in advance -- debt payoff, emergency savings, or essential expenses,” said Paul Ricci, chief executive of personal loans site Best Egg. Put debt reduction and financial health ahead of lifestyle upgrades. “Applying refunds toward high-interest balances can reduce financial stress and improve credit utilization,” Ricci said. “Prioritizing emergency savings – 3 to 6 months of expenses -- helps prevent future reliance on credit when unexpected costs arise.” Medora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

(NASDAQ: NXT ) is one of the best new tech stocks to invest in now . On February 17, Nextpower announced a multi-year supply agreement with Jinko Solar (US) Industries Inc. to provide gigawatt-scale steel solar module frames. Under the terms of the deal, Nextpower will supply at least 1 GW of steel frames, with the potential to scale up to 3 GW over three years. These components will support Jinko Solar’s manufacturing operations at its Jacksonville, Florida facility, with production slated to begin in mid-2026. To support this partnership and further localize its supply chain, Nextpower Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT) intends to expand its manufacturing capacity in the Southeastern US to simplify logistics for direct supply to Jinko Solar’s Florida plant. This move follows Nextpower’s recent growth in Memphis and contributes to a network of over 25 US factories that the company has established or expanded since 2021 to meet the rising demand for domestic solar components. The transition to steel frames offers structural and financial advantages for the solar industry. Independent testing indicates that steel frames provide superior durability and stiffness compared to traditional materials for reliability in extreme weather. Furthermore, using US-made steel frames allows developers to add six percent to a tracker project’s domestic content calculation, helping them align with US Treasury Department guidance and national manufacturing priorities.

Heading into its fiscal Q2 2026 report, analysts forecast Copart to earn $0.39 per share on $1.15 billion in sales. In fact, Copart earned just $0.36 per share on sales of $1.12 billion. Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » Image source: Getty Images. Copart Q2 earnings Copart revenues slipped 4% year over year in Q2, resulting in a 10% decline in per-share profit, worsening a decline that began in Q1. Year to date, Copart's sales are down 1%, and earnings are flat against fiscal 2025 at $0.77 per share. That's the bad news. The good news is that Copart's free cash flow is up significantly this year. Although operating cash flow was basically unchanged year over year at $662.8 million, Copart cut its purchases of property and equipment nearly in half, to just $177.7 million. As a result, free cash flow so far this year is a strong $485.1 million -- and trending toward perhaps $970 million through the end of the fiscal year! Is Copart stock a buy? Copart management didn't give much in the way of guidance, but assuming Copart can hit that mark, the stock would be trading for a price-to-free cash flow ratio of 37.4. Back out $5.1 billion in net cash on the balance sheet, and the EV/FCF ratio on this one falls to just 32.1. I can't call the stock a \"buy\" at this valuation -- not with profits flat and revenues falling. But there's no doubt Copart stock is getting cheaper, and it's already a lot cheaper than it was a year ago. Should you buy stock in Copart right now?

      "content": "French Banking Giant Société Générale Launches Euro Stablecoin On XRP Ledger Akriti Seth Thu, February 19, 2026 at 2:33 AM CST 2 min read XRP-USD ETH-USD One of France’s largest banking institutions, Société Générale, is launching a euro-denominated stablecoin, EUR Coinvertible, on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) through its digital asset subsidiary, SG FORGE. It is the first time a major European banking institution has selected XRPL as the primary blockchain for a regulated stablecoin deployment. SG-FORGE, which previously launched the EUR CoinVertible (EURCV) stablecoin on Ethereum in 2023, is now expanding to XRPL. Cassie Craddock, Managing Director, UK & Europe, Ripple said, “Societe Generale-FORGE has long been a pioneer amongst European institutions when it comes to building out a market-leading crypto-assets offering for their customers.” In addition, there is a growing trend of major institutions moving on-chain. Can this be a major validation of XRPL’s enterprise-grade infrastructure? It certainly extends Ripple’s growing partnerships with traditional financial institutions. The move also aligns perfectly with Ripple’s institutional settlement strategy. It focuses on providing the plumbing for banks to move value globally without the friction of the legacy financial system. It signals that high-speed, low-cost networks are becoming essential for modern finance. DISCOVER: Top 20 Crypto to Buy in 2026 Ripple’s Strategy To Position XRPL As “Infrastructure Of Choice For Regulated Financial Institutions Entering Digital Asset Space” Jean-Marc Stenger, CEO of SG-FORGE, emphasized the strategic importance of this expansion. The successful launch of EUR Coinvertible on the XRP Ledger is a new step, reinforcing our commitment to offering next-generation, compliant crypto-assets that promote transparency, security, and scalability. Meanwhile, Ripple executives have called this a “huge win for the ecosystem.” Ripple has been actively courting traditional finance players, particularly in the wake of regulatory clarity initiatives in multiple jurisdictions. The XRP Ledger can process transactions in 3-5 seconds with fees typically under $0.01, making it attractive for institutional payment applications. The partnership aligns with Ripple’s broader strategy to position XRPL as the infrastructure of choice for regulated financial institutions entering the digital asset space. This integration allows the bank to explore new use cases, such as using the stablecoin for trading collateral. It also mirrors similar regulatory wins in the sector, such as the recent approvals for Stripe’s crypto bridge , showcasing how compliance is opening doors for big players. Story Continues However, it is worth noting that while the infrastructure is being built, volume for tokenized assets on XRPL has had to catch up to other chains. This launch could be the catalyst needed to boost liquidity.

On January 28, The Southern Company (NYSE:SO) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.74 per share on its common stock. Payment is scheduled for March 6, this year, to shareholders of record on February 17. Southern Company (SO) Maintains Stability Amid Shifting Landscape Pixabay/Public Domain This announcement continues 78 consecutive years of quarterly dividends equal to or greater than the prior quarter. The 74 cents-per-share payment was first declared in April 2025, marking the 24th consecutive annual increase. At the time, CEO Christopher Womack cited employee dedication and predictable growth from state-regulated utilities and long-term contracts as the main reason for the increase. In a different update, on January 20, Wells Fargo analyst Shahriar Pourreza downgraded Southern’s shares from Equal Weight to Underweight and slashed the price target to $84 from $97. Pourreza tied the shift to heightened political volatility in Georgia, following November elections that saw Democrats take two Republican-held seats on the state Public Service Commission. He insisted the decision is not a reflection of management’s ability to execute, and described the leadership as one of the best in the industry. Pourreza recognized Southern’s robust and diverse load growth pipeline in the South East (primarily in Georgia), which is driven by DC’s and industrial manufacturing. That said, Pourreza cautioned that the 2026 election cycle stands to generate more noise and uncertainty for the regulatory construct in Georgia. The Southern Company (NYSE:SO) is an Atlanta, Georgia-based energy utility that provides electricity to 9 million customers through its subsidiaries across the Southeast. The company operates a diverse portfolio of generation assets, including natural gas, coal, nuclear, and renewable facilities. While we acknowledge the potential of SO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

(NYSE: DLR ) is one of the best infrastructure stocks to buy right now . On February 6, 2026, TD Cowen raised its price target on Digital Realty (NYSE:DLR) to $185 from $179 while keeping a Hold rating. The firm cited strong Q4 results and the potential for better renewal spreads through 2026, which could lift Core‑FFO/share growth. Digital Realty (DLR) Expands Global Footprint, Faces EPS Miss Studio Grand Ouest/Shutterstock.com On the same day, February 6, 2026, Citi lowered its price target on Digital Realty to $190 from $212 but maintained a Buy rating. Citi said Q4 results showed progress with bookings and funding, but adjusted the target to reflect lower valuation multiples. Digital Realty reported its Q4 and full‑year 2025 results on February 5, 2026. EPS came in at $0.24, missing analyst estimates of $0.29 by about 17%, while revenue beat expectations at $1.63 billion versus the forecast of $1.58 billion. The company booked $400 million in Q4, bringing full‑year bookings to $1.2 billion. Same‑capital cash NOI grew 4.5% year‑over‑year, and liquidity stood at $7 billion at year‑end. Digital Realty now operates over 300 data centers across 55+ metro areas, with 3 gigawatts of IT capacity in place and 769 megawatts under construction. CEO Andy Power highlighted AI adoption as a major driver, noting power availability as a key constraint. In 2025, Digital Realty expanded into Indonesia and Malaysia, launched its Private AI Exchange (AIPx), and raised $3.2 billion in its first private capital fund. The company also reported over $15 billion of capital available for hyperscale development, with more than 5 gigawatts of future capacity planned. Digital Realty Trust, Inc.

(NYSE: AWK ) is one of the best infrastructure stocks to buy right now . On February 10, shareholders of American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK) and Essential Utilities Inc. (NYSE:WTRG) approved merger-related proposals at special meetings held that day. American Water Works (AWK) Expands Scale with Essential Utilities Merger According to American Water, at least 99% of its shares present voted to approve share issuance for the merger. Nearly 95% of Essential Utilities shares voted in favor of the merger agreement. The all-stock, tax-free merger, announced October 26, 2025, combines the two largest US regulated water and wastewater utilities into one serving over 4.7 million connections across 17 states. The combined company will retain the American Water name and will be headquartered in Camden, New Jersey. Closing is expected by the end of Q1 2027, subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust clearance, public utility commission approvals in multiple states, including Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and other conditions. Separately, on January 12, 2026, BofA Securities lifted American Water stock from Underperform to Neutral and boosted its price target to $139 from $117. BofA highlighted the stock’s depressed pricing versus electric and gas counterparts, where its earnings multiple edge has narrowed from above 140% historically to below 25% currently. The firm anticipated the ongoing merger would counter issues tied to customer bill burdens and the durability of EPS expansion outlook. BofA contended that American Water’s extended 50-to-100-year pipeline upgrades deserve a valuation lift over electric utilities, which share roughly 9% EPS trajectories but hinge on accelerated construction for data center clients. American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK) is a regulated water utility that provides drinking water and wastewater services to approximately 14 million people in 24 states. The company operates pipeline infrastructure totaling more than 54,500 miles, serving around 1,700 communities.

(NASDAQ: XEL ) is one of the best infrastructure stocks to buy right now . On February 13, UBS upgraded Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL) from Neutral to Buy and increased its price target to $89 from $81. Analyst William Appicelli made the upgrade. Analysts Turn Bullish on Xcel Energy (XEL) Amid Data Center Boom Appicelli noted that Xcel has a steady 9% earnings-per-share expansion, backed by full regulatory oversight, plus rising data center electricity needs that remain underappreciated in the current valuation. The analyst also highlighted Xcel’s recent hike in expected data center load to 4 gigawatts from 2 gigawatts. Further upside came from transmission work in the SPP market, and Colorado plans adding 2.1 gigawatts, said Appicelli. As a result, UBS baked in a 7% premium to the sector average for its model. The firm is also eyeing two turns of P/E multiple gains, and dismissed Texas Smokehouse fire resolution costs as under $100 million. Independent of the analyst action, Xcel shared Q4 2025 results on February 5, in which ongoing EPS was $0.96 per share. This figure fell at the lower end of Wall Street’s estimated range, and was up 18.5% year over year. According to the earnings report, quarterly revenue hit $3.56 billion, which narrowly missed the $3.64-$3.77 billion forecast. Nonetheless, the revenue jumped 14.1% year over year. Management attributed the growth to a 14.2% increase in electric and natural gas sales. The company reaffirmed FY2026 ongoing EPS of $4.04-$4.16 and a long-term 6-8+% annual growth through 2030 via $60 billion capex. Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL) is a regulated utility company. It provides electricity and natural gas to 3.7 million electric customers and 2.1 million natural gas customers across eight states.

I’m an observer of Bitcoin. While Solomon maintained that he owns minimal personal Bitcoin holdings, Goldman Sachs has been cautious in its institutional cryptocurrency strategy. But the bank’s expanding presence in the cryptocurrency sector has been evident. Recently, the bank relaunched its cryptocurrency trading desk and has been actively developing digital asset custody solutions for institutional investors. According to recent SEC filings, Goldman Sachs has built a position of over $2.3 billion in crypto ETFs. Interestingly, the bank holds nearly equal amounts of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. DISCOVER: Top 20 Crypto to Buy in 2026 “Until 10 minutes ago, the regulatory structure was extremely prohibitive” “When you burden this system with excessive regulation, you start to extract capital,” Solomon said. “That absolutely happened in the last five years.” Goldman Sach’s cryptocurrency division serves hedge funds, asset managers, and other institutional clients seeking exposure to Bitcoin and other digital assets through regulated financial products. This client-focused strategy allows Goldman to capitalize on growing institutional demand without requiring executive-level personal conviction. Solomon’s admission fits a growing pattern of acceptance spread across the highest levels of finance. Recently, a BlackRock executive publicly endorsed crypto allocations , reinforcing the idea that Wall Street is moving from “testing the waters” to diving in.

On January 26, Jefferies’ Julian Dumoulin-Smith lowered his price target on Sempra (NYSE:SRE) to $89 from $95 and kept the Hold recommendation intact. The analyst cited California risks as the reason for the price target reduction. Sempra (SRE) Confronts Legal Uncertainty, Analysts Adjust Targets The adjustment stems from new legal challenges facing SoCalGas, a Sempra unit, over its response to the Eaton fire. This challenge, said Dumoulin-Smith, heightens overall operational uncertainties for the company. The analyst observed that investors previously saw Sempra’s California operations as less exposed to wildfires than competitors, but this perception is now shifting due to this case. As a result, the analyst also trimmed projections to account for changes in California’s capital cost assumptions and outcomes from the track two regulatory process. In a separate update, on January 22, BMO Capital analyst James Thalacker cut the price target on Sempra (NYSE:SRE) to $100 from $103 and reaffirmed an Outperform rating. Thalacker labeled the stock’s recent plunge an overreaction to Southern California Edison’s lawsuit accusing SoCalGas of mishandling the Eaton fire. According to the analyst, he took into account initial fire damage projections and the fact that over 12 defendants face similar claims. As such, Thalacker adjusted downward his projections for Sempra’s California utility segment. He also predicted investor skepticism would linger until Sempra files its defense in the litigation. Sempra (NYSE:SRE) is a San Diego, California-based energy infrastructure company. It provides electricity and natural gas to nearly 40 million consumers across North America.

(NYSE: CCI ) is one of the best infrastructure stocks to buy right now . On February 9, Citizens analyst Greg Miller reaffirmed a Market Outperform rating and $125 price target on Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) following Q4 2025 results. Crown Castle (CCI) Faces DISH Fallout, Analysts Split on Outlook Aleksandr Bagri/Shutterstock.com Miller attributed quarterly headwinds to ongoing disputes with former DISH Network clients after tower agreement terminations. He noted DISH as a recent top growth driver, now contributing about 5% of site rental income. The analyst added that stripping out DISH and Sprint effects, revenue rose 3.5%, and that this trails the firm’s long-term benchmarks. ​Miller anticipated leasing momentum to lift expansion ahead, and observed that “the growth days of the towers are now behind.” He framed Crown Castle as a low-volatility counterbalance to data center exposure in digital infrastructure portfolios. Separately, on February 6, BMO Capital analyst Ari Klein reduced the price target on Crown Castle to $91 from $97 while upholding an Outperform rating. Klein deemed Crown Castle’s FY2026 forecast underwhelming, which he noted was driven by heavier-than-anticipated fallout from DISH Network. According to Klein, DISH’s exit hampered organic growth projections. Also, leasing volumes face a modest dip, excluding DISH. Crown Castle considers roughly 3% organic growth, including Sprint churn, as its minimum, but BMO expects limited near-term gains. As a result, Klein projected initial share weakness on the outlook yet viewed it as clearing hurdles. He added that Crown Castle is primed to gain most from any DISH accord amid timing unknowns.

However, this EPS was down 7.8% year over year due to higher taxes, contracting costs, depreciation, and interest expenses, noted management.

On February 11, Goldman Sachs lifted its price target on Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) to $142 from $141 while retaining a Buy rating. Duke Energy (DUK) Advances Strategy Amid Rising Demand Trends Pixbabay/Public Domain ​Goldman focused on Duke’s updated five-year capital investment blueprint totaling $103 billion. The blueprint is a jump from the prior $87 billion forecast, and, according to Duke, it is set to drive 9.6% compound annual rate base expansion through 2030. The bank noted that Duke’s management reiterated EPS growth guidance of 5%-7% annually through 2030. They expect the acceleration toward the top half beginning in 2028, fueled by data center contributions. Goldman viewed this outlook as conservative and projected closer to 8% average EPS advancement over the horizon. This growth, said the bank, will be bolstered by potential for stronger-than-expected electricity demand growth. On the same day, that is February 11, BTIG analyst Alex Kania reaffirmed a Buy rating and $141 price target on Duke. Kania pointed to Duke’s Q4 adjusted EPS of $1.50 that nearly matched BTIG and consensus estimates of $1.49. This performance underscores Duke’s reliable history of hitting targets and delivering on strategy, stated Kania. Kania also praised Duke’s expansions to its generation assets and Energy Supply Agreement backlog, paired with a “de-risked approach” to data center development plans. Although he flagged the updated financing strategy, doubling equity issuances, as “an area worth monitoring,” Kania upheld optimism on overall execution.

This will give investors regulated access to Sui Network’s native token and approximately 7% staking rewards. Both funds hold physical SUI tokens and stake them on Sui Network’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validation mechanism. The Canary Staked SUI ETF (NASDAQ: SUIS) and Grayscale Sui Staking ETF (GSUI) on NYSE Arca represent a major expansion of crypto ETF products beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Commenting on the move, Steven McClurg, CEO at Canary Capital said, “The Canary Staked SUI spot ETF (SUIS) brings exposure to SUI in a registered, exchanged-traded structure, while also enabling investors to benefit from net staking rewards generated through SUI’s proof-of-stake mechanism.” DISCOVER: Top 20 Crypto to Buy in 2026 “Sui Network Represents The Evolution Of Blockchain Utility” Net staking rewards currently yield around 7% are reflected in each fund’s net asset value (NAV), allowing shareholders to capture both price appreciation and on-chain yields without managing validators themselves. Grayscale’s GSUI charges a 0.35% annual sponsor fee, waived for the first three months or until assets reach $1 billion. The fund launched with 100% of holdings staked. Canary filed for SUIS in March 2025 and received SEC approval, following the precedent set by spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 and Ethereum ETFs in 2025. “The Sui Network represents the evolution of blockchain utility. It’s highly scalable, supported by robust developer activity, and designed for real-world adoption,” said McClurg. Adding to this, Adeniyi Abiodun, Co-Founder and CPO of Mysten Labs, the original contributor to Sui said, “Today marks an important milestone for both institutional and retail access to the Sui ecosystem.

The company said roughly 8% is “locked in” through final investment decision projects alongside modest gathering and processing expansion. Williams announced during the presentation that it won approval on “Socrates The Younger” power initiative and site extensions. This boosted the power backlog to 6 gigawatts from an implied 5 gigawatts and lengthened two contracts to 12.5 years from 10. The company also detailed that it carries $12 billion in active construction contracts and a $37 billion opportunity pipeline. It also holds roughly 10 gigawatts in equipment orders for an extra $14 billion shadow-shadow backlog. In this light, Wells Fargo forecasted a 12% EBITDA CAGR across seven years, which surpassed the Williams guide. Independent of the analyst action, on February 6, Reuters revealed that Williams is exploring the acquisition of US natural gas production assets. The move aims to secure natural gas supplies for its one-stop energy services to hyperscalers and AI data center developers, Reuters said in an exclusive report.

On February 12, DA Davidson began coverage of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), issuing it a Buy rating and a $450 price target. The firm stated that the company’s “compounding execution moat in leading edge manufacturing” results in a “durable, self-reinforcing advantage” as interest in artificial intelligence processing grows. Taiwan Semi’s competitive edge, according to DA Davidson, comes from its capacity to “repeatedly industrialize architectural transitions into predictable, high volume platforms,” pointing out that consumers ultimately choose timely delivery of products at a reasonable cost. Although rivals can match specific characteristics “on paper,” the firm states that Taiwan Semi’s advantage lies in its capacity to transform new devices and power architectures into “high yield, high throughput manufacturing with validated enablement and predictable ramps.” Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is a leading Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturer. The company’s core offerings include wafer fabrication, mask manufacturing, and engineering support services.
