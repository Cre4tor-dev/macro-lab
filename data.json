      "content": "1 Brilliant Vanguard Index Fund to Buy Before It Soars 25%, According to Wall Street Analysts David Dierking, The Motley Fool Fri, February 20, 2026 at 9:20 AM PST 3 min read NVDA INTC For the first time in more than three years, investors are giving an extended look to areas of the market beyond tech. Energy and consumer staples are among the best-performing sectors this year. Value and dividend stocks have made a comeback. International equities have been on a tear since the beginning of 2025. Another category that's had a strong start to the year is small caps. Long unloved and ignored, they're getting attention for their comparatively small exposure to tech and attractive valuations. The Russell 2000, a generally accepted benchmark for small caps, is receiving some eye-catching price targets from analysts. Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » The ETF Action database, which compiles price targets for companies within a particular ETF, currently has a 25% 12-month upside target for the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF (NASDAQ: VTWO) . Let's break down the investment case for this fund heading into the remainder of 2026. Image source: Getty Images. Why Wall Street is turning bullish on small caps again Even though small caps are considered riskier and have more boom/bust potential than large caps , there comes a point where the value and the narrative are impossible to ignore. For example: Valuation concerns about megacaps, potential rate cuts, and a deregulation tailwind would all benefit small caps. Currently, the Russell 2000 is expected  to grow 2026 earnings by 19% compared to a 13% growth forecast for the S&P 500 . The Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF has a price/earnings (P/E) ratio of 18 versus 28 for the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF . It's not often that the value and growth stories both line up for small caps, but that's happening now. And the market has begun to recognize it. Why the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF is positioned for the next leg Megacaps have dominated the U.S. equity market for years, but concentration risk is beginning to rise. The same \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that have pulled the major market averages higher are all down year-to-date as of Feb. 13, and they're all down more than 10% from their all-time highs. Tech has become an anchor this year. Small companies tend to disproportionately benefit from lower interest rates because many carry higher debt loads. Current rate-cut expectations are modest, but any unexpected disinflation, growth, or labor market shock could quickly have the Federal Reserve thinking about more rate cuts. Story Continues But if the U.S. economy can maintain a \"soft landing\" or \"no landing\" outcome, small caps could find additional momentum. For years, investors were interested only in the growth stories being offered by large-cap and megacap stocks. The next phase of the market cycle could finally reward the small caps.

Q4 revenue climbed 12% year-over-year to $1.1 billion, driven by a 17% surge in order entries across the banking and retail sectors. The company’s strategic focus on modular retail solutions and ATM recycling technology has led to significant market gains, including nine new major retail logos in the US grocery and pharmacy sectors. While operating expenses rose by 3.7% due to labor costs and investments in service infrastructure, management noted that the rollout of new field service software is largely complete, positioning the company for margin expansion starting in Q2 2026. Despite a slight decline in retail margins caused by external cyber-related disruptions, the banking segment remains robust with strong branch automation demand in North America and a recovery expected in Latin America. Diebold Nixdorf enters 2026 with a solid $730 million product backlog and anticipates revenue growth to be weighted toward H2 of the year. The CEO emphasized that the company remains disciplined in its capital allocation, prioritizing shareholder returns through buybacks while evaluating tuck-in acquisitions that could immediately bolster its service capabilities and global footprint.

(NASDAQ: RELY ) is one of the best new tech stocks to invest in now . On February 18, Remitly Global recorded revenue of $1.635 billion in the full year 2025, which was a 29% increase year-over-year. Q4 was particularly strong with $442 million in revenue and $41 million in net income, driven by a 19% increase in active users to over 9 million. A significant highlight was the surge in high-value transactions, with volume from very high amount senders skyrocketing 105% in the quarter. The company is undergoing a major leadership transition as co-founder Matt Oppenheimer steps into the role of Executive Chairman, passing the CEO mantle to former Amazon and Apple executive Sebastian Gunningham. This shift comes as Remitly scales its product ecosystem through new offerings like Flex, which is a send-now-pay-later service that has already surpassed 120,000 users. Furthermore, the launch of Remitly Business and the integration of advanced AI fraud models have improved operational efficiency, leading to record-low transaction losses and a tripled free cash flow of $283 million for the year.

On February 4, Ralliant reported Q4 2025 revenue of $555 million, which was only a 1% increase year-over-year but exceeded company guidance. Growth was uneven across segments: while the Communications division surged by 29% and Sensors & Safety Systems grew 6%, the Test & Measurement segment saw a 6% decline as customers remained cautious with capital expenditure. The company faced a significant financial setback during the quarter, recording a $1.4 billion non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to its EA Elektro-Automatik business. Management attributed this write-down to a cooling in EV demand and shifts in global subsidies. Additionally, Ralliant is navigating structural cost headwinds following its recent spin-off, which are expected to impact adjusted EBITDA margins by 250 basis points in 2026. Ralliant issued full-year revenue guidance of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.22 to $2.42 for 2026. While the Test & Measurement segment is expected to remain at the lower end of growth expectations, the company remains committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy that balances organic investment in AI and digital platforms with strategic tuck-in acquisitions.

DATE Friday, Feb. 20, 2026 at 11 a.m. ET CALL PARTICIPANTS President and Chief Executive Officer — Katherine Holt Antonello Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer — Michael Aldo Pedraja Full Conference Call Transcript Katherine Holt Antonello: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2025 earnings call. Joining me is Michael Aldo Pedraja, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, I will begin by providing highlights of our fourth quarter 2025 results and then hand it over to Michael for more details on our financials. Before our Q&A, I will come back to you with some additional thoughts. I would like to begin with how we are actively addressing the elevated frequency of California cumulative trauma claims. To be clear, this remains a California-specific issue. Claim frequency in our other states and within non-CT claims in California continues to trend favorably. We recognized early that the CT environment was creating a hard market in California, and we moved decisively, have implemented rate increases, and tightened underwriting on several classes of business. We are not waiting for legislative reform, though we do believe the growing impact on California businesses and public budgets will make the case for reform increasingly difficult to ignore. While we are confident that these California pricing and underwriting actions, along with the steps we are taking across the country, will strengthen our underwriting profitability, they are also likely to reduce written premium in 2026. It is worth highlighting that our small commercial franchise maintained strong retention rates throughout 2025, a clear sign the investments we have made in automation and ease of use are genuinely resonating. I am also pleased to report that our standard fourth quarter full actuarial assessment concluded that no additional reserve strengthening or adjustments to our current accident year loss and LAE ratio was necessary. In addition to our internal analysis, we engaged a market-leading actuarial firm to independently assess our estimated ultimate loss, and they concluded that our carried reserves were well within the range of reasonable estimates. We believe the outcome of these two analyses confirms the actions we took in the third quarter adequately addressed recent workers’ compensation trends. I am excited to discuss our new workers’ compensation product, which represents a strategic expansion of our capabilities. By leveraging our core workers’ compensation expertise into the excess layer, we are creating new growth avenues while diversifying our risk profile. Our aggressive adoption of AI tools has accelerated the product’s development, and I am pleased to report that we are now accepting submissions. The early market response has been strong, and we expect this product will deepen our distribution partner relationships while expanding our addressable market. Story Continues We continued to execute on our commitment to returning capital to stockholders by delivering $215,000,000 of share repurchases and regular quarterly dividends in 2025. In January, we completed the $125,000,000 capital recapitalization plan that we announced in the third quarter. These capital management steps reflect our continued confidence in our financial position and our commitment to delivering value to shareholders. Along with our operational performance, these actions increased our book value per share, including the gain, by 11% to $51.31. We believe our focus on disciplined underwriting, prudent risk management, and strategic investments continues to position us strongly in the workers’ compensation insurance market, which is evidenced by A.M. Best’s recent reaffirmation of our insurance companies’ financial strength rating of A. With that, Michael will now provide a deeper dive into our fourth quarter financial results, and then I will return to provide my closing remarks. Michael? Michael Aldo Pedraja: Thank you, Katherine. Gross premiums written were $156,800,000 compared to $176,300,000 for the prior-year quarter, a decrease of 11% due primarily to a decrease in new business writings and lower final audit premiums, partially offset by higher renewal business premium. Our losses and LAE were $134,400,000 versus $113,200,000 a year ago, an increase of 18.7% due primarily to an increase in the accident year 2025 selected loss and LAE ratio and the absence of favorable developments in the fourth quarter of this year. Commission expense was $25,800,000 for the quarter versus $24,400,000 for the prior year, an increase of 5.7% driven by nonrecurring adjustments. Underwriting expenses were $39,800,000 for the quarter versus $44,200,000 for the prior year, a decrease of 10%. The improvement in underwriting expenses for the fourth quarter was due primarily to continued expense management efforts, including reduced personnel costs and other variable costs, such as policyholder dividends and bad debt. Net investment income was $31,400,000 for the quarter compared to $26,700,000 for the prior year, an increase of 17.6%, due mostly to private equity investment return distributions and an overall higher book yield on our fixed income portfolio. As Katherine mentioned, we executed an investment rebalancing to address several strategic goals, including reducing our equity investment allocation to target levels and increasing our overall portfolio yield. Our equity investments, like most in the market, have appreciated very nicely and reached 16% of our investment portfolio versus a target allocation of approximately 10%. As part of the investment rebalancing, we also sold low-yielding fixed income securities to offset the associated equity gains and redeploy the proceeds into higher-yielding fixed income investments. The investment rebalancing accomplished several goals, including reducing our equity investments to target allocation, increasing our overall investment portfolio yield by a net 40 basis points, extracting an estimated net present value gain of $16,000,000, and reducing our required capital. The sale of fixed income investments produced an after-tax realized loss of $40,000,000, which reduced net income and adjusted book value per share during the quarter. Our stockholders’ equity and book value per share were not impacted by the investment rebalancing. Our fixed maturities maintain a modified duration of 4.4 with strong average credit quality of A+. Aided by our investment rebalancing, our weighted average book yield increased to 4.9% at quarter end compared to 4.5% for the prior year. Our adjusted net income, which excludes net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses and the benefit of our LPT deferred gain amortization, was $14,500,000 for the quarter, compared to $28,700,000 last year. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased almost 2,400,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $40.94 per share, or $97,000,000. The average repurchase price represented a 20% discount to our book value per share, including the deferred gain, and adjusted book value per share. During the period from January 1 through February 18 of this year, the company repurchased a further 898,594 shares of its common stock at an average price of $44.28 per share. Our remaining share repurchase authorization is $53,100,000. As we have highlighted, we aim to be good stewards of our shareholders’ capital. At current price levels, we are convinced that the Employers Holdings, Inc. stock is meaningfully undervalued, and executing share repurchases at these price levels produces a significant return on investment and generates significant value for our continuing shareholders. I will now turn the call back to Katherine. Katherine Holt Antonello: Thank you, Michael. Yesterday, our Boa",

(NYSE: FIG ) is one of the best new tech stocks to invest in now . On February 18, Figma reported the financial results for Q4 2025, with revenue reaching $304 million, marking a 40% increase year-over-year. For the full year, the company surpassed $1 billion, generating $1.056 billion in total revenue. This growth was supported by a net dollar retention rate of 136% among customers with over $10,000 in ARR and international expansion, which grew 45% compared to the previous year. The company is prioritizing AI-native functionality to drive user engagement and expand its customer base. The CEO highlighted the success of Figma Make and the integration of AI credits, noting that 75% of large customers are already using these credits weekly. However, Figma also anticipates that its non-GAAP operating margin will decrease from 12% in 2025 to 8% in 2026. This is attributed to increased investments in AI infrastructure, elevated stock-based compensation following its IPO, and the costs associated with transitioning to a hybrid monetization model involving both seats and AI credits. Figma provided Q1 2026 revenue guidance of $315 to $317 million and full-year guidance of approximately $1.37 billion.

      "content": "Tax refunds are big this year, IRS data show. Here's how big. Medora Lee, USA TODAY Fri, February 20, 2026 at 9:13 AM PST 4 min read The number of tax returns the IRS has received so far this tax season is down from last year, but refunds are up double digits, IRS data show. The average refund through Feb. 6 was $2,290, up nearly 11% from $2,065 at the same time in 2025 while total returns received fell 5.2%. The IRS noted refund numbers should rise further, too, as refunds claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) are required by law to be held until Feb. 15. These “refund numbers do not include millions of EITC and ACTC refunds to these taxpayers,” the agency said in its release. “This means the refund numbers expected to be released Feb. 27, for refunds processed through Feb. 20, are expected to be higher.” That should be encouraging news to Americans who are struggling under the weight of elevated prices and a slowing job market , analysts said. “Higher refunds should be a tailwind for consumers, particularly lower income consumers who use tax refunds for debt paydown and big-ticket purchases,” said Mihir Bhatia, analyst at Bank of America. Average refunds are big. How to get mine faster? \"Combining direct deposit with electronic filing is the fastest way to receive your refund ,\" the IRS said. Most refunds are issued in less than 21 days for taxpayers who filed a flawless return electronically and chose direct deposit. Nine out of 10 taxpayers already receive their tax refunds by direct deposit, but to boost that closer to 100%, the IRS began phasing out paper checks last September. \"Paper checks are over 16 times more likely to be lost, stolen, altered, or delayed than electronic payments,\" the IRS said. \"Direct deposit also avoids the possibility that a refund check could be returned to the IRS as undeliverable.\" How do I know when my refund’s coming? Through the IRS \" Where's My Refund \" tool, you can track when the IRS received your tax return, when it approved a refund and when it issued the refund. The money should land in your account within five days from the date the IRS approves your refund. If you mailed a paper return and expect a refund, it could take four weeks or more to process your return, the IRS said. Since refunds for Americans who claimed the EITC/ACTC can’t be released until mid-February for early filers , those taxpayers may have to wait until around March 3 to see their refunds in their bank accounts or on debit cards, if they chose direct deposit and there are no issues with the tax return. If you don’t have a bank account, find one through the FDIC website or the National Credit Union Administration using their Credit Union Locator Tool . Usually, people can open a b a nk account pretty quickly. You can also ask your tax preparer if they offer other electronic payment options. Story Continues Otherwise, you might be able to deposit your refund onto a reloadable prepaid debit card or mobile app. Many reloadable prepaid cards and mobile apps have routing and account numbers, which may be different from the card number. Check with your financial institution to make sure your card or app can receive the deposit and double-check the routing and account numbers. Tax filers saw $172.26 billion in federal income tax refunds head their way through March 24. While that's a great deal of money, the total dollar amount is down $16.4 billion or down 8.7% from a year ago. Tax refunds How should people use their tax refunds? Along with that big check comes big responsibility, so make sure not to spend it all away , financial experts said. Here are some ideas : Since refunds are expected to be larger than usual , splitting a refund can be a convenient way to manage your money. You can split the refund in any proportion you want, sending some to an account for immediate use and some for future savings, in up to three different accounts with U.S. financial institutions, reloadable prepaid debit cards, or mobile apps.  You can use your tax software to do it electronically or use IRS Form 8888, Allocation of Refund if you file a paper return. Plan how to use the refund before receiving it. This “reduces overspending risk by assigning the refund a job in advance -- debt payoff, emergency savings, or essential expenses,” said Paul Ricci, chief executive of personal loans site Best Egg. Put debt reduction and financial health ahead of lifestyle upgrades. “Applying refunds toward high-interest balances can reduce financial stress and improve credit utilization,” Ricci said. “Prioritizing emergency savings – 3 to 6 months of expenses -- helps prevent future reliance on credit when unexpected costs arise.” Medora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

(NASDAQ: NXT ) is one of the best new tech stocks to invest in now . On February 17, Nextpower announced a multi-year supply agreement with Jinko Solar (US) Industries Inc. to provide gigawatt-scale steel solar module frames. Under the terms of the deal, Nextpower will supply at least 1 GW of steel frames, with the potential to scale up to 3 GW over three years. These components will support Jinko Solar’s manufacturing operations at its Jacksonville, Florida facility, with production slated to begin in mid-2026. To support this partnership and further localize its supply chain, Nextpower Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT) intends to expand its manufacturing capacity in the Southeastern US to simplify logistics for direct supply to Jinko Solar’s Florida plant. This move follows Nextpower’s recent growth in Memphis and contributes to a network of over 25 US factories that the company has established or expanded since 2021 to meet the rising demand for domestic solar components. The transition to steel frames offers structural and financial advantages for the solar industry. Independent testing indicates that steel frames provide superior durability and stiffness compared to traditional materials for reliability in extreme weather. Furthermore, using US-made steel frames allows developers to add six percent to a tracker project’s domestic content calculation, helping them align with US Treasury Department guidance and national manufacturing priorities.

Heading into its fiscal Q2 2026 report, analysts forecast Copart to earn $0.39 per share on $1.15 billion in sales. In fact, Copart earned just $0.36 per share on sales of $1.12 billion. Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » Image source: Getty Images. Copart Q2 earnings Copart revenues slipped 4% year over year in Q2, resulting in a 10% decline in per-share profit, worsening a decline that began in Q1. Year to date, Copart's sales are down 1%, and earnings are flat against fiscal 2025 at $0.77 per share. That's the bad news. The good news is that Copart's free cash flow is up significantly this year. Although operating cash flow was basically unchanged year over year at $662.8 million, Copart cut its purchases of property and equipment nearly in half, to just $177.7 million. As a result, free cash flow so far this year is a strong $485.1 million -- and trending toward perhaps $970 million through the end of the fiscal year! Is Copart stock a buy? Copart management didn't give much in the way of guidance, but assuming Copart can hit that mark, the stock would be trading for a price-to-free cash flow ratio of 37.4. Back out $5.1 billion in net cash on the balance sheet, and the EV/FCF ratio on this one falls to just 32.1. I can't call the stock a \"buy\" at this valuation -- not with profits flat and revenues falling. But there's no doubt Copart stock is getting cheaper, and it's already a lot cheaper than it was a year ago. Should you buy stock in Copart right now?

      "content": "French Banking Giant Société Générale Launches Euro Stablecoin On XRP Ledger Akriti Seth Thu, February 19, 2026 at 2:33 AM CST 2 min read XRP-USD ETH-USD One of France’s largest banking institutions, Société Générale, is launching a euro-denominated stablecoin, EUR Coinvertible, on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) through its digital asset subsidiary, SG FORGE. It is the first time a major European banking institution has selected XRPL as the primary blockchain for a regulated stablecoin deployment. SG-FORGE, which previously launched the EUR CoinVertible (EURCV) stablecoin on Ethereum in 2023, is now expanding to XRPL. Cassie Craddock, Managing Director, UK & Europe, Ripple said, “Societe Generale-FORGE has long been a pioneer amongst European institutions when it comes to building out a market-leading crypto-assets offering for their customers.” In addition, there is a growing trend of major institutions moving on-chain. Can this be a major validation of XRPL’s enterprise-grade infrastructure? It certainly extends Ripple’s growing partnerships with traditional financial institutions. The move also aligns perfectly with Ripple’s institutional settlement strategy. It focuses on providing the plumbing for banks to move value globally without the friction of the legacy financial system. It signals that high-speed, low-cost networks are becoming essential for modern finance. DISCOVER: Top 20 Crypto to Buy in 2026 Ripple’s Strategy To Position XRPL As “Infrastructure Of Choice For Regulated Financial Institutions Entering Digital Asset Space” Jean-Marc Stenger, CEO of SG-FORGE, emphasized the strategic importance of this expansion. The successful launch of EUR Coinvertible on the XRP Ledger is a new step, reinforcing our commitment to offering next-generation, compliant crypto-assets that promote transparency, security, and scalability. Meanwhile, Ripple executives have called this a “huge win for the ecosystem.” Ripple has been actively courting traditional finance players, particularly in the wake of regulatory clarity initiatives in multiple jurisdictions. The XRP Ledger can process transactions in 3-5 seconds with fees typically under $0.01, making it attractive for institutional payment applications. The partnership aligns with Ripple’s broader strategy to position XRPL as the infrastructure of choice for regulated financial institutions entering the digital asset space. This integration allows the bank to explore new use cases, such as using the stablecoin for trading collateral. It also mirrors similar regulatory wins in the sector, such as the recent approvals for Stripe’s crypto bridge , showcasing how compliance is opening doors for big players. Story Continues However, it is worth noting that while the infrastructure is being built, volume for tokenized assets on XRPL has had to catch up to other chains. This launch could be the catalyst needed to boost liquidity.

On January 28, The Southern Company (NYSE:SO) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.74 per share on its common stock. Payment is scheduled for March 6, this year, to shareholders of record on February 17. Southern Company (SO) Maintains Stability Amid Shifting Landscape Pixabay/Public Domain This announcement continues 78 consecutive years of quarterly dividends equal to or greater than the prior quarter. The 74 cents-per-share payment was first declared in April 2025, marking the 24th consecutive annual increase. At the time, CEO Christopher Womack cited employee dedication and predictable growth from state-regulated utilities and long-term contracts as the main reason for the increase. In a different update, on January 20, Wells Fargo analyst Shahriar Pourreza downgraded Southern’s shares from Equal Weight to Underweight and slashed the price target to $84 from $97. Pourreza tied the shift to heightened political volatility in Georgia, following November elections that saw Democrats take two Republican-held seats on the state Public Service Commission. He insisted the decision is not a reflection of management’s ability to execute, and described the leadership as one of the best in the industry. Pourreza recognized Southern’s robust and diverse load growth pipeline in the South East (primarily in Georgia), which is driven by DC’s and industrial manufacturing. That said, Pourreza cautioned that the 2026 election cycle stands to generate more noise and uncertainty for the regulatory construct in Georgia. The Southern Company (NYSE:SO) is an Atlanta, Georgia-based energy utility that provides electricity to 9 million customers through its subsidiaries across the Southeast. The company operates a diverse portfolio of generation assets, including natural gas, coal, nuclear, and renewable facilities. While we acknowledge the potential of SO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

(NYSE: DLR ) is one of the best infrastructure stocks to buy right now . On February 6, 2026, TD Cowen raised its price target on Digital Realty (NYSE:DLR) to $185 from $179 while keeping a Hold rating. The firm cited strong Q4 results and the potential for better renewal spreads through 2026, which could lift Core‑FFO/share growth. Digital Realty (DLR) Expands Global Footprint, Faces EPS Miss Studio Grand Ouest/Shutterstock.com On the same day, February 6, 2026, Citi lowered its price target on Digital Realty to $190 from $212 but maintained a Buy rating. Citi said Q4 results showed progress with bookings and funding, but adjusted the target to reflect lower valuation multiples. Digital Realty reported its Q4 and full‑year 2025 results on February 5, 2026. EPS came in at $0.24, missing analyst estimates of $0.29 by about 17%, while revenue beat expectations at $1.63 billion versus the forecast of $1.58 billion. The company booked $400 million in Q4, bringing full‑year bookings to $1.2 billion. Same‑capital cash NOI grew 4.5% year‑over‑year, and liquidity stood at $7 billion at year‑end. Digital Realty now operates over 300 data centers across 55+ metro areas, with 3 gigawatts of IT capacity in place and 769 megawatts under construction. CEO Andy Power highlighted AI adoption as a major driver, noting power availability as a key constraint. In 2025, Digital Realty expanded into Indonesia and Malaysia, launched its Private AI Exchange (AIPx), and raised $3.2 billion in its first private capital fund. The company also reported over $15 billion of capital available for hyperscale development, with more than 5 gigawatts of future capacity planned. Digital Realty Trust, Inc.

(NYSE: AWK ) is one of the best infrastructure stocks to buy right now . On February 10, shareholders of American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK) and Essential Utilities Inc. (NYSE:WTRG) approved merger-related proposals at special meetings held that day. American Water Works (AWK) Expands Scale with Essential Utilities Merger According to American Water, at least 99% of its shares present voted to approve share issuance for the merger. Nearly 95% of Essential Utilities shares voted in favor of the merger agreement. The all-stock, tax-free merger, announced October 26, 2025, combines the two largest US regulated water and wastewater utilities into one serving over 4.7 million connections across 17 states. The combined company will retain the American Water name and will be headquartered in Camden, New Jersey. Closing is expected by the end of Q1 2027, subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust clearance, public utility commission approvals in multiple states, including Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and other conditions. Separately, on January 12, 2026, BofA Securities lifted American Water stock from Underperform to Neutral and boosted its price target to $139 from $117. BofA highlighted the stock’s depressed pricing versus electric and gas counterparts, where its earnings multiple edge has narrowed from above 140% historically to below 25% currently. The firm anticipated the ongoing merger would counter issues tied to customer bill burdens and the durability of EPS expansion outlook. BofA contended that American Water’s extended 50-to-100-year pipeline upgrades deserve a valuation lift over electric utilities, which share roughly 9% EPS trajectories but hinge on accelerated construction for data center clients. American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK) is a regulated water utility that provides drinking water and wastewater services to approximately 14 million people in 24 states. The company operates pipeline infrastructure totaling more than 54,500 miles, serving around 1,700 communities.

(NASDAQ: XEL ) is one of the best infrastructure stocks to buy right now . On February 13, UBS upgraded Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL) from Neutral to Buy and increased its price target to $89 from $81. Analyst William Appicelli made the upgrade. Analysts Turn Bullish on Xcel Energy (XEL) Amid Data Center Boom Appicelli noted that Xcel has a steady 9% earnings-per-share expansion, backed by full regulatory oversight, plus rising data center electricity needs that remain underappreciated in the current valuation. The analyst also highlighted Xcel’s recent hike in expected data center load to 4 gigawatts from 2 gigawatts. Further upside came from transmission work in the SPP market, and Colorado plans adding 2.1 gigawatts, said Appicelli. As a result, UBS baked in a 7% premium to the sector average for its model. The firm is also eyeing two turns of P/E multiple gains, and dismissed Texas Smokehouse fire resolution costs as under $100 million. Independent of the analyst action, Xcel shared Q4 2025 results on February 5, in which ongoing EPS was $0.96 per share. This figure fell at the lower end of Wall Street’s estimated range, and was up 18.5% year over year. According to the earnings report, quarterly revenue hit $3.56 billion, which narrowly missed the $3.64-$3.77 billion forecast. Nonetheless, the revenue jumped 14.1% year over year. Management attributed the growth to a 14.2% increase in electric and natural gas sales. The company reaffirmed FY2026 ongoing EPS of $4.04-$4.16 and a long-term 6-8+% annual growth through 2030 via $60 billion capex. Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL) is a regulated utility company. It provides electricity and natural gas to 3.7 million electric customers and 2.1 million natural gas customers across eight states.

I’m an observer of Bitcoin. While Solomon maintained that he owns minimal personal Bitcoin holdings, Goldman Sachs has been cautious in its institutional cryptocurrency strategy. But the bank’s expanding presence in the cryptocurrency sector has been evident. Recently, the bank relaunched its cryptocurrency trading desk and has been actively developing digital asset custody solutions for institutional investors. According to recent SEC filings, Goldman Sachs has built a position of over $2.3 billion in crypto ETFs. Interestingly, the bank holds nearly equal amounts of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. DISCOVER: Top 20 Crypto to Buy in 2026 “Until 10 minutes ago, the regulatory structure was extremely prohibitive” “When you burden this system with excessive regulation, you start to extract capital,” Solomon said. “That absolutely happened in the last five years.” Goldman Sach’s cryptocurrency division serves hedge funds, asset managers, and other institutional clients seeking exposure to Bitcoin and other digital assets through regulated financial products. This client-focused strategy allows Goldman to capitalize on growing institutional demand without requiring executive-level personal conviction. Solomon’s admission fits a growing pattern of acceptance spread across the highest levels of finance. Recently, a BlackRock executive publicly endorsed crypto allocations , reinforcing the idea that Wall Street is moving from “testing the waters” to diving in.

On January 26, Jefferies’ Julian Dumoulin-Smith lowered his price target on Sempra (NYSE:SRE) to $89 from $95 and kept the Hold recommendation intact. The analyst cited California risks as the reason for the price target reduction. Sempra (SRE) Confronts Legal Uncertainty, Analysts Adjust Targets The adjustment stems from new legal challenges facing SoCalGas, a Sempra unit, over its response to the Eaton fire. This challenge, said Dumoulin-Smith, heightens overall operational uncertainties for the company. The analyst observed that investors previously saw Sempra’s California operations as less exposed to wildfires than competitors, but this perception is now shifting due to this case. As a result, the analyst also trimmed projections to account for changes in California’s capital cost assumptions and outcomes from the track two regulatory process. In a separate update, on January 22, BMO Capital analyst James Thalacker cut the price target on Sempra (NYSE:SRE) to $100 from $103 and reaffirmed an Outperform rating. Thalacker labeled the stock’s recent plunge an overreaction to Southern California Edison’s lawsuit accusing SoCalGas of mishandling the Eaton fire. According to the analyst, he took into account initial fire damage projections and the fact that over 12 defendants face similar claims. As such, Thalacker adjusted downward his projections for Sempra’s California utility segment. He also predicted investor skepticism would linger until Sempra files its defense in the litigation. Sempra (NYSE:SRE) is a San Diego, California-based energy infrastructure company. It provides electricity and natural gas to nearly 40 million consumers across North America.

(NYSE: CCI ) is one of the best infrastructure stocks to buy right now . On February 9, Citizens analyst Greg Miller reaffirmed a Market Outperform rating and $125 price target on Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) following Q4 2025 results. Crown Castle (CCI) Faces DISH Fallout, Analysts Split on Outlook Aleksandr Bagri/Shutterstock.com Miller attributed quarterly headwinds to ongoing disputes with former DISH Network clients after tower agreement terminations. He noted DISH as a recent top growth driver, now contributing about 5% of site rental income. The analyst added that stripping out DISH and Sprint effects, revenue rose 3.5%, and that this trails the firm’s long-term benchmarks. ​Miller anticipated leasing momentum to lift expansion ahead, and observed that “the growth days of the towers are now behind.” He framed Crown Castle as a low-volatility counterbalance to data center exposure in digital infrastructure portfolios. Separately, on February 6, BMO Capital analyst Ari Klein reduced the price target on Crown Castle to $91 from $97 while upholding an Outperform rating. Klein deemed Crown Castle’s FY2026 forecast underwhelming, which he noted was driven by heavier-than-anticipated fallout from DISH Network. According to Klein, DISH’s exit hampered organic growth projections. Also, leasing volumes face a modest dip, excluding DISH. Crown Castle considers roughly 3% organic growth, including Sprint churn, as its minimum, but BMO expects limited near-term gains. As a result, Klein projected initial share weakness on the outlook yet viewed it as clearing hurdles. He added that Crown Castle is primed to gain most from any DISH accord amid timing unknowns.

However, this EPS was down 7.8% year over year due to higher taxes, contracting costs, depreciation, and interest expenses, noted management.

On February 11, Goldman Sachs lifted its price target on Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) to $142 from $141 while retaining a Buy rating. Duke Energy (DUK) Advances Strategy Amid Rising Demand Trends Pixbabay/Public Domain ​Goldman focused on Duke’s updated five-year capital investment blueprint totaling $103 billion. The blueprint is a jump from the prior $87 billion forecast, and, according to Duke, it is set to drive 9.6% compound annual rate base expansion through 2030. The bank noted that Duke’s management reiterated EPS growth guidance of 5%-7% annually through 2030. They expect the acceleration toward the top half beginning in 2028, fueled by data center contributions. Goldman viewed this outlook as conservative and projected closer to 8% average EPS advancement over the horizon. This growth, said the bank, will be bolstered by potential for stronger-than-expected electricity demand growth. On the same day, that is February 11, BTIG analyst Alex Kania reaffirmed a Buy rating and $141 price target on Duke. Kania pointed to Duke’s Q4 adjusted EPS of $1.50 that nearly matched BTIG and consensus estimates of $1.49. This performance underscores Duke’s reliable history of hitting targets and delivering on strategy, stated Kania. Kania also praised Duke’s expansions to its generation assets and Energy Supply Agreement backlog, paired with a “de-risked approach” to data center development plans. Although he flagged the updated financing strategy, doubling equity issuances, as “an area worth monitoring,” Kania upheld optimism on overall execution.

This will give investors regulated access to Sui Network’s native token and approximately 7% staking rewards. Both funds hold physical SUI tokens and stake them on Sui Network’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validation mechanism. The Canary Staked SUI ETF (NASDAQ: SUIS) and Grayscale Sui Staking ETF (GSUI) on NYSE Arca represent a major expansion of crypto ETF products beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Commenting on the move, Steven McClurg, CEO at Canary Capital said, “The Canary Staked SUI spot ETF (SUIS) brings exposure to SUI in a registered, exchanged-traded structure, while also enabling investors to benefit from net staking rewards generated through SUI’s proof-of-stake mechanism.” DISCOVER: Top 20 Crypto to Buy in 2026 “Sui Network Represents The Evolution Of Blockchain Utility” Net staking rewards currently yield around 7% are reflected in each fund’s net asset value (NAV), allowing shareholders to capture both price appreciation and on-chain yields without managing validators themselves. Grayscale’s GSUI charges a 0.35% annual sponsor fee, waived for the first three months or until assets reach $1 billion. The fund launched with 100% of holdings staked. Canary filed for SUIS in March 2025 and received SEC approval, following the precedent set by spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 and Ethereum ETFs in 2025. “The Sui Network represents the evolution of blockchain utility. It’s highly scalable, supported by robust developer activity, and designed for real-world adoption,” said McClurg. Adding to this, Adeniyi Abiodun, Co-Founder and CPO of Mysten Labs, the original contributor to Sui said, “Today marks an important milestone for both institutional and retail access to the Sui ecosystem.

The company said roughly 8% is “locked in” through final investment decision projects alongside modest gathering and processing expansion. Williams announced during the presentation that it won approval on “Socrates The Younger” power initiative and site extensions. This boosted the power backlog to 6 gigawatts from an implied 5 gigawatts and lengthened two contracts to 12.5 years from 10. The company also detailed that it carries $12 billion in active construction contracts and a $37 billion opportunity pipeline. It also holds roughly 10 gigawatts in equipment orders for an extra $14 billion shadow-shadow backlog. In this light, Wells Fargo forecasted a 12% EBITDA CAGR across seven years, which surpassed the Williams guide. Independent of the analyst action, on February 6, Reuters revealed that Williams is exploring the acquisition of US natural gas production assets. The move aims to secure natural gas supplies for its one-stop energy services to hyperscalers and AI data center developers, Reuters said in an exclusive report.

For the fourth quarter, the company’s net income reached $316.6 million, or $0.97 per share, which compares to the $453.5 million, or $1.43 per share, posted in Q4 2024. WEC Energy initiated a 2026 guidance range of $5.51-$5.61 and forecasted a 6.5%-7% EPS compound annual growth rate this year. For the longer term, the company expects a growth of 7%-8% off the midpoint. Mizuho believes that management’s confidence in future growth is a great boost for investor sentiment, which is why the firm lifted its price target on the shares. Separately, on the same day, February 6, Scotiabank reaffirmed its Sector Outperform rating on WEC Energy Group and kept the $140 price target. The bank said that strong growth prospects driven by increasing data center demand was the key factor supporting its decision. The analysts highlighted WEC’s remarkable track record of exceeding earnings guidance. They also noted that the company has surpassed original EPS guidance midpoints for 22 consecutive years, and expressed confidence in WEC’s guidance of 7%-8% growth. WEC Energy Group, Inc. (NYSE:WEC) is a Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based utility holding company that provides electricity and natural gas to 4.7 million customers across the Midwest. The company operates regulated utilities and transmission networks, mainly through its WEC Infrastructure segment.

On February 12, DA Davidson began coverage of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), issuing it a Buy rating and a $450 price target. The firm stated that the company’s “compounding execution moat in leading edge manufacturing” results in a “durable, self-reinforcing advantage” as interest in artificial intelligence processing grows. Taiwan Semi’s competitive edge, according to DA Davidson, comes from its capacity to “repeatedly industrialize architectural transitions into predictable, high volume platforms,” pointing out that consumers ultimately choose timely delivery of products at a reasonable cost. Although rivals can match specific characteristics “on paper,” the firm states that Taiwan Semi’s advantage lies in its capacity to transform new devices and power architectures into “high yield, high throughput manufacturing with validated enablement and predictable ramps.” Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is a leading Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturer.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid · Reuters Reuters Thu, February 19, 2026 at 3:33 AM CST 2 min read SBUX Feb 18 (Reuters) - Starbucks faced fresh pressure on Wednesday from a coalition of investors including public-sector pension funds that urged shareholders ‌to vote against the reelection of two directors, citing persistent failure ‌to manage labor relations. The move against Starbucks' lead independent director, Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, and Beth ​Ford, chair of the board's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, comes as the company is locked in a prolonged effort to reach a collective agreement with its unionized baristas. More than 3,800 baristas had joined a nationwide strike late last ‌year - marking the longest ⁠work stoppage in its history - as the Starbucks Workers United union pressed for better staffing, more predictable schedules and higher ⁠pay after drawn-out contract talks. The dispute has become a high-profile test for CEO Brian Niccol as he works to revive sales. \"We are concerned that, without a ​constructive ​relationship between Starbucks and its unionized workforce, ​sustaining the turnaround may prove ‌difficult,\" the investors said in a letter ahead of the March 25 annual meeting. New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, New York City Comptroller Mark Levine, Trillium ESG Global Equity Mutual Fund, SOC Investment Group, Merseyside Pension Fund and the Shareholder Association for Research and Education are all signatories. \"We offer the ‌best job in retail with hourly partners earning ​an average of $30 an hour and world-class ​benefits... all for those who ​only work 20 hours a week on average,\" Starbucks ‌said in a statement. The investor group had, ​in January, written ​to the two directors raising concerns over the board's elimination of its Environmental, Partner, and Community Impact Committee without explanation. The committee's responsibilities were reallocated ​across existing committees ‌and the full board reclaimed primary responsibility for labor oversight, Starbucks ​told Reuters on Wednesday.

The iconic S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has gained at least 16% in all but one year since 2019. Meanwhile, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) just eclipsed 50,000 for the first time in its nearly 130-year history, and the technology-driven Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) has consistently delivered outsize returns. There has been no shortage of catalysts fueling this upside, including the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) , the advent of quantum computing, the prospect of additional interest rate cuts, and record share buyback activity from S&P 500 companies. Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » Image source: Getty Images. But if history has proven anything, it's that when things seem too good to be true for the stock market, they often are. The benchmark S&P 500 just did something that investors haven't witnessed in more than a quarter century -- and there's no mistaking the message behind this event . This hasn't been observed since the dot-com bubble burst Before going any further, it's worth pointing out that historical correlations can't guarantee short-term directional moves in the Dow, S&P 500, or Nasdaq Composite. Nevertheless, some events have statistically correlated very strongly with directional moves in Wall Street's major stock indexes. It's these historical correlations that tend to raise eyebrows among investors. One historically correlated indicator of intrigue concerns S&P 500 drawdowns. Using data from Bloomberg Finance, investing podcast The Compound labeled every instance since 2000 in which 115 (or more) of the 500 companies that comprise the benchmark index endured at least a 7% single-session drawdown over a rolling eight-day trading period. As you can imagine, instances of heightened downside volatility frequently occurred during short-lived crash events, such as the COVID-19 crash and the week following the unveiling of President Donald Trump's tariff and trade policy, as well as toward the tail-end of bear markets. Over 26 years, the average S&P 500 drawdown from its high was 34% when 115 or more components fell at least 7% in a single session across a rolling eight-day window. Story Continues However, this very specific drawdown indicator just occurred with the S&P 500 only 2% below its all-time high. The only other time since 2000 when 115 or more S&P 500 stocks fell at least 7% over a rolling eight-trading-day window, and the benchmark index was only a few percent below its record high, was the early stages of the dot-com bubble. While nothing is guaranteed, this statistical increase in outsize declines from some of Wall Street's most influential stocks has consistently foreshadowed weakness in equities. This worrisome signal coincides with this being the second-priciest stock market in history, based on readings from the S&P 500's Shiller Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio. The previous five instances in which the Shiller P/E exceeded 30 for at least two months, dating back to January 1871, eventually resulted in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and/or Nasdaq Composite shedding 20% to 89% of their value. Statistically, Wall Street's bull market looks to be running on borrowed time. Image source: Getty Images. Time and perspective can change everything on Wall Street Although headwinds appear to be mounting for the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite, the outlook for these indexes can vary greatly depending on investors' perspectives and investment timelines. To be blunt, stock market corrections, bear markets, and crash events are normal, healthy, and inevitable. No policy maneuvering from the Federal Reserve or government, nor well-wishing from investors, can stop these often emotion-propelled moves lower in Wall Street's major stock indexes. But taking a step back and recognizing the nonlinearity of stock market cycles is foundational to being a successful investor. Recently, analysts at Bespoke Investment Group published a data set on X (formerly Twitter) that calculated the calendar-day length of every S&P 500 bull and bear market, dating back to the start of the Great Depression in September 1929. What Bespoke's data highlights is the clear disparity in length between bull and bear markets. On one end of the spectrum, the typical 20% or greater decline in the S&P 500 has resolved in 286 calendar days, or about 9.5 months. What's more, no bear market has endured longer than 630 calendar days. In comparison, the average S&P 500 bull market has persisted approximately 3.5 times as long (1,011 calendar days), with 10 of the 27 bull markets spanning 96 years lasting more than 1,200 calendar days. Statistically, wagering on the stock market's major indexes to rise over time has been a wise decision. This means any significant decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite serves as a surefire buying opportunity for investors willing to stay the course for years, if not decades. If history repeats with the S&P 500's drawdown indicator, bargains may abound for investors in the not-too-distant future. Should you buy stock in S&P 500 Index right now?

      "content": "DoorDash sees strong quarterly growth in sales and orders but warns of big costs DEE-ANN DURBIN Updated Thu, February 19, 2026 at 3:38 AM CST 2 min read DASH ROO.L DoorDash ( DASH ) stock rose 13% during premarket hours on Thursday after announcing on Wednesday that its revenue rose 38% in the fourth quarter as it gained new U.S. customers and added new services like restaurant reservations . But the San Francisco-based delivery company also warned of costly investments ahead. DoorDash CEO and Co-founder Tony Xu said DoorDash is in the midst of building a single tech platform that will bring together its many international businesses. DoorDash bought Wolt , a Finnish delivery service, in 2022, and it acquired Deliveroo , a U.K. rival, last year. Xu said the majority of the tech platform will be completed this year, and even before it's complete, the company will save money and time because it will be able to roll out updates to all of its markets at once. But in the meantime, Xu called the new platform “a massive and expensive undertaking.” “I wish that the tech stack were already here,” Xu said during a conference call with investors Thursday. DoorDash said it expects adjusted pretax earnings between $675 million and $775 million in the first quarter, which was lower than the $800.6 million Wall Street was expecting, according to analysts polled by FactSet. DoorDash also spent heavily during the fourth quarter on multiple projects, including the development of autonomous robot delivery and drone delivery . Its research and development costs rose 41%, for example, while its sales and marketing costs jumped 31%. DoorDash’s net income rose 51% to $213 million, or 49 cents per share. That was lower than the 59-cent profit Wall Street anticipated. DoorDash reported revenue of $3.96 billion for the October-December period. That was also less than the $3.99 billion that analysts forecast. Still, total orders rose 32% to 903 million, beating analysts’ forecast of 884.8 million, according to FactSet. DoorDash said it had more than 56 million active users during the quarter, including 35 million members paying monthly fees to be part of its DashPass, Wolt+ and Deliveroo Plus programs. Xu said customers have always used DoorDash for quick, mid-week orders. But the company is increasingly seeing customers use DoorDash for bigger weekend grocery trips as well. DoorDash and Kroger, the largest U.S. grocery chain, expanded their delivery partnership last fall. Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard More Info",

      "content": "Trying to Cut Retirement Taxes? Avoid This Common Strategy Brian O'Connor Thu, February 19, 2026 at 3:00 AM CST 5 min read MORN Want to Minimize Retirement Taxes? Don't Follow This Popular Strategy If you’re planning on making tax-deferred retirement accounts the last pot of money you tap after retirement, you’ve got a lot of company. And why not? The idea that your 401(k) or traditional IRA can keep growing and churning out more tax-deferred money seems like a sound strategy. But you may want to rethink this conventional wisdom. Instead of focusing on deferring taxes, Morningstar’s Mark Miller suggests looking at how to minimize your overall total taxes during retirement – which can mean tapping tax-deferred accounts first. A financial advisor can help you decide on an order in which to tap your retirement accounts. “The idea is to use dollars in 401(k) or IRA accounts to meet living expenses — or convert a portion of these assets to Roth IRA accounts — before claiming Social Security in years when your marginal tax rate is lower than it will be after you start to receive benefit,” Miller writes. Tax Considerations in Retirement Want to Minimize Retirement Taxes? Don't Follow This Popular Strategy One consideration Miller highlights is the fact that collecting Social Security benefits while making withdrawals from tax-deferred retirement accounts will very likely mean you’ll pay taxes on your Social Security benefits. Single tax filers who bring in between $25,000 and $34,000 in what the IRS calls “combined income” can be taxed on 50% of their Social Security benefits. Meanwhile, those who earn over $34,000 in combined income will pay taxes on up to 85% of their benefits. The limits for joint tax filers are $32,000 and $44,000. (Combined income is your adjusted gross income, plus nontaxable interest income from bonds and half of your Social Security benefits.) As Miller notes, when Social Security benefits first became taxable in 1984 and then extended in 1994, the legislation didn’t include adjustments to the income levels that trigger what some advisers call the “tax torpedo.” This refers to the combined effect that earned income and Social Security have on a retiree’s tax liability. “The original idea was to tax only relatively high-income beneficiaries, and that remains the case. But the number of people affected is rising. That’s because Social Security benefits are indexed to wage growth and adjusted for inflation, while the income threshold levels used to determine the taxable amount of Social Security benefits are fixed by law and not indexed for wage growth or inflation. What You Can Do Want to Minimize Retirement Taxes? Don't Follow This Popular Strategy Aside from drawing down tax-deferred accounts before claiming Social Security, one way to sidestep this “tax torpedo” is by having Roth assets. Remember, for someone in the 22% tax bracket, each $1 of compounded earnings in a taxable 401(k) or traditional IRA yields just 78 cents – plus the potential tax triggered on Social Security benefits. But every $1 of compounded earnings in a tax-free Roth IRA equates to $1 of retirement income. And because it’s non-taxable, it doesn’t count toward your combined income. Story Continues One of the many considerations for retirees is figuring out how to complete Roth conversions in the most tax-efficient manner possible. Doing so will mean you’ll have more tax-free money to draw upon without adding to your combined income. But you’ll want to keep the amount of money you convert low enough so you’re only subject to the lowest income tax brackets. Alternatively, you could rely strictly on cash from taxable accounts to meet living expenses early in retirement, allowing yourself to delay Social Security benefits. Remember, Social Security increases by 8% every year between your full retirement age (67 for most people today) and age 70. A financial advisor can help you weigh your options for your retirement income strategy. Figuring out how to make this work means each individual will need to run their own numbers, a task that’s not too difficult for people projecting the impact of withdrawals from an IRA plus collecting Social Security benefits. People with additional concerns or complex situations can consult with a financial advisor or tax planner. They can also turn to a lower-cost service like Income Strategy, which calculates Social Security and drawdown sequencing, as Miller notes. Bottom Line Tapping your tax-deferred assets first can help lower your total tax burden in retirement, Morningstar’s Mark Miller writes. This flies in the face of conventional wisdom, which dictates you withdraw tax-deferred assets last, allowing them to continue to grow. But this alternative strategy allows you to defer Social Security and maximize your future benefit. Roth conversions are another way you can generate tax-free income in retirement that won’t add to your combined income. Tax Planning Tips A financial advisor can help you plan for retirement taxes and offer advice on how to draw down your assets in a tax-efficient manner. Finding a financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you’re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now. If you’re focused on limiting your tax liability in retirement, you may be thinking about moving to a more tax-friendly state. SmartAsset has a retirement tax-friendliness tool designed to help you identify the states that are most and least tax-friendly for retirees. Keep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks .

      "content": "Centrica Earnings Slide as Investments Drive Strategic Reset Charles Kennedy Thu, February 19, 2026 at 2:49 AM CST 4 min read CPYYF Centrica plc posted lower earnings in 2025 but raised its dividend and pressed ahead with major investments as it targets a step-up in EBITDA by 2030. The UK-based energy and services group reported adjusted EBITDA of £1.4 billion for 2025, down from £2.3 billion in 2024, with adjusted operating profit falling to £814 million from £1.6 billion. Adjusted earnings per share declined to 11.2p from 19.0p a year earlier, reflecting weaker commodity pricing, nuclear outages, and subdued trading conditions. Más de Yahoo Scout Why did Centrica's earnings fall significantly in 2025? What is Centrica's strategy for transforming its portfolio? How much is Centrica investing in nuclear projects? What are Centrica's EBITDA targets through 2030? Statutory results were hit harder. Operating profit fell to £0.1 billion from £1.7 billion in 2024, as Centrica booked £0.7 billion in exceptional charges and remeasurement losses on energy derivatives, alongside £0.5 billion in impairments tied to late-life gas fields and nuclear investments outside Sizewell C. The group reported a statutory loss per share of 1.5p, compared with a 25.7p profit in 2024. Despite the earnings decline, Centrica increased its full-year dividend by 22% to 5.5p per share, up from 4.5p in 2024, in line with its progressive dividend policy. The company returned £1.1 billion to shareholders in 2025, including £0.8 billion via share buybacks and £0.2 billion in dividends, and completed a £2 billion buyback program before pausing further repurchases to prioritize investment opportunities. Net operating cash flow fell to £0.7 billion from £1.1 billion in 2024, while free cash flow swung to a £0.2 billion outflow, reflecting a sharp increase in capital expenditure to £1.2 billion—more than double the prior year’s £0.6 billion. Adjusted net cash declined to £1.5 billion from £2.9 billion, although the balance sheet remains robust. Retail adjusted EBITDA held steady at £0.6 billion, supported by cost discipline and improved performance in Home Services, offsetting weaker UK Home Energy Supply earnings. The company reported customer growth across all retail businesses for the first time in more than a decade, alongside improved customer satisfaction metrics. Optimisation—encompassing gas and power trading—saw adjusted EBITDA halve to £0.2 billion amid challenging market conditions. Infrastructure earnings dropped more sharply. Adjusted EBITDA fell to £0.7 billion from £1.4 billion, reflecting lower realized commodity prices, the pause in Rough gas storage operations, and nuclear outages. Centrica’s 2025 strategy focused on repositioning the portfolio toward more stable, infrastructure-like earnings. The group committed £1.3 billion (capped) to the 3.2 GW Sizewell C nuclear project, securing a real allowed return on equity of 10.8% and targeting a double-digit internal rate of return. It expects the project to build an £8 billion regulated asset base by commercial operation. Leer más The company also acquired a 50% stake in the Grain LNG terminal alongside Energy Capital Partners, investing £0.2 billion in equity for an expected unlevered IRR of around 9%, with potential upside from site expansion. In parallel, Centrica continued reshaping its upstream exposure, divesting most of Spirit Energy’s producing assets except the Morecambe Hub, and extending operating lives at Heysham 1 and Hartlepool nuclear plants to March 2028. It also formalized a partnership with X-energy to explore advanced modular reactor deployment in the UK. Looking ahead, Centrica is targeting £1.7 billion in adjusted EBITDA by the end of 2028, rising to £2.0 billion by 2030, supported by its transformation program, incremental infrastructure investment, and anticipated nuclear life extensions. The guidance midpoint allows for ±£0.3 billion annual volatility. The strategy aligns with broader UK energy policy trends, emphasizing energy security, nuclear expansion, and LNG import resilience following years of gas market volatility. By reallocating capital from upstream production to regulated and contracted infrastructure, Centrica is seeking to reduce earnings cyclicality and improve long-term visibility. While 2025 marked a step down from the windfall conditions of prior years, management framed the year as one of structural repositioning—trading near-term earnings strength for long-duration, infrastructure-backed cash flows.

(NASDAQ: NBIS ) is one of the best stocks to buy and hold for the next 6 months . On February 10, Nebius Group NV (NASDAQ:NBIS) reached an agreement to acquire Tavily. With the acquisition, the company gains access to a company that develops software to help artificial intelligence agents search for up-to-date information needed for financial trading and coding. Nebius Group N.V. (NBIS) Strengthens AI Platform With $275M Tavily Deal According to people familiar with the matter, Nebius is to pay $275 million as part of the deal, which will also see Tavily founder and CEO Rotem Weiss join the company. The acquisition will strengthen the company’s efforts to offer software for handling AI workloads while also providing access to open-source models. Additionally, the acquisition will advance Nebius’ strategy of building a unified platform that enables vertical AI companies and enterprises to build, tune, and run autonomous agents. By leveraging Tavily’s agentic search solution, Nebius will also expand its integrated software stack that developers need to assemble and operate enterprise-grade agentic systems. “This acquisition brings the search layer directly into our stack, so developers can focus on their applications instead of managing multiple vendors. Our strategy is clear: provide an open platform that serves everyone from startups to the largest enterprises, giving them the tools to own their AI destiny,” Roman Chernin, co-founder and Chief Business Officer of Nebius, said: Nebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ:NBIS) is focused on building full-stack infrastructure for the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. It provides AI-native cloud computing, large-scale GPU clusters, and developer tools for training and running AI models. While we acknowledge the potential of NBIS as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

(NASDAQ: CRWV ) is one of the best stocks to buy and hold for the next 6 months . On February 6, CoreWeave Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV) launched its first big brand campaign called “Ready for Anything, Ready for AI” with Chance the Rapper as the face of it. The campaign shows CoreWeave’s new vision of helping people and companies who are building with AI to go further and innovate faster. CoreWeave Inc. (CRWV) Eyes Opportunities in Validating AI Performance and Costs As AI moves from testing to large-scale use, CoreWeave wants to highlight its role as the backbone for AI projects. The campaign explains how its cloud technology is built to handle big ideas and future growth. With recent acquisitions like Weights & Biases, OpenPipe, and Monolith, CoreWeave is uniting everything under one clear brand identity while continuing to grow quickly. A day earlier on February 5, CoreWeave Inc. unveiled a new solution designed to help organizations validate the performance and costs of artificial intelligence workloads before deployment. CoreWeave ARENA is a new platform that enables testing applications on production-scale infrastructure. It replaces traditional sandbox environments by providing production-scale compute paired with standardized evaluation tools. The platform also provides access to the company’s Mission Control operating system and AI-native infrastructure through the SUNK and CKS platforms. Customers are already reporting performance improvements and cost reductions on leveraging CoreWeave ARENA capabilities. One customer experienced a significant reduction in cost of ownership, while another saw 10 times faster training than with cloud services running on GPU hardware. “Companies are now building products that have to perform in the real world, and quickly. But there’s been a gap between testing a model and actually running it at scale. CoreWeave ARENA closes that gap,” said Chen Goldberg, Senior Vice President of Engineering at CoreWeave.

On February 2, research firm Leerink Partners downgraded BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) to a Market Perform from an Outperform and set a $113 price target. BioNTech SE (BNTX) Rallying on Solid Oncology Strategy Pixabay/Public Domain The downgrade is in response to the stock rallying from its December lows of $92 to $113. The 24% gain over the same period outpaced the 4% gain of the S&P Biotechnology Select Industry. According to Leerink Partners, the new rating and price target bring the stock in line with its discounted cash flow valuation. Despite the downgrade, the research firm remains confident about BioNTech’s long-term prospects with its oncology strategy. The firm is especially confident about pumitamig, a VEGFA/PD-L1 bispecific antibody partnered with Bristol Myers Squibb. The company remains in a strong financial position with $20.3 billion in cash expected to support the development of the oncology pipeline. Earlier on January 28, the company’s Supervisory Board appointed Kylie Jimenez to the Management Board as Chief People Officer (“CPO”). The appointment aligns with the company’s push to become a multi-product oncology company by 2030. Jimenez will be responsible for shaping and leading BioNTech’s people strategy and its execution. On January 21, BioNTech said the FDA gave Fast Track status to its cancer drug BNT113 for HPV16+ head and neck cancer. The decision is based on early trial results, and the drug is being tested with pembrolizumab to improve survival for patients who currently have limited treatment options.

(CIFR)’s Outlook According to the investment bank, Cipher Mining is one of the Bitcoin mining companies well-positioned to benefit from a pivot to data centers. The investment bank expects Bitcoin companies with established data centers to naturally attract infrastructure investors who value long-term, stable cash flows. Consequently, Morgan Stanley compares Cipher Mining’s business model to data center REITs that trade at 20X EV/FY1 EBITDA. Meanwhile, on February 4, the company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Black Perl Compute LLC, completed a $2 billion 6.125% senior secured note due 2031. The unit is to use net proceeds from the offering to finance the construction costs of the Black Pearl Facility, a high-performance computing data center in Texas. It will also use $232.5 million to reimburse Cipher Mining for its prior equity contribution. Cipher Mining Inc.

On February 9, Harmony Gold Mining Company Ltd (NYSE:HMY) confirmed that its newly acquired CSA Copper Mine in Australia requires a capital injection and a strategic rethink. Harmony Gold Mining Company Ltd. (HMY) Faces Challenges With CSA Copper Mine Copyright: tomas1111 / 123RF Stock Photo The company took over the CSA mine in New South Wales last October by acquiring Mac Copper in a deal worth $1.03 billion. The acquisition is part of the company’s push to diversify into copper, as gold mining in South Africa becomes extremely costly due to the depth of the country’s mines. Under Mac Copper, CSA Copper Mine produced 40,000 metric tons of copper per year. However, it is still unclear if it can maintain or increase the output. “It could be up to two years or even more potentially to de-risk and de-bottleneck the mine,” Chief Executive Beyers Nel said. “It is a mine that is constrained at the moment. It is a mine that requires a bit of a rethink and recapitalisation.” Harmony Gold also owns Eva Copper in Queensland, Australia, and is a joint owner with Newmont of Wafi-Golpu, a gold-copper project in Papua New Guinea. Harmony Gold Mining Company Ltd. (NYSE:HMY) is a major, experienced gold producer and specialist with extensive operations in South Africa and Papua New Guinea, and a growing copper portfolio in Australia.

The hedge fund returned about 30% annually without a single down year during that period. Today, Druckenmiller only manages his own money through Duquesne Family Office, and he made some interesting trades in the fourth quarter. He sold his stake in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and bought shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , a stock up 210,000% since its IPO in 1997. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks » Importantly, the fourth quarter ended about 45 days ago, so investors need to reevaluate both companies based on current information before making the same trades. Here are the important details. Image source: Getty Images. Meta Platforms: The stock Stanley Druckenmiller sold in the fourth quarter Meta owns the three most popular social media platforms as measured by monthly active users: Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. That affords the company valuable insight into consumer behavior and interests, which supports precise ad targeting. That advantage has helped Meta become the second-largest adtech company in the world. Meta has doubled down on that advantage by investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI). The company has developed machine learning models that retrieve, rank, and recommend content, as well as tools that help advertisers create and optimize campaigns. Additionally, Meta has developed custom chips to train and run the underlying models. Meta reported encouraging financial results in the fourth quarter. Revenue increased 24% to $59.9 billion as more engaging content drove an increase in ad impressions, and better ad performance allowed the company to charge more per ad. However, net income increased just 11% to $8.88 per diluted share, growing more slowly than the top line due to aggressive AI spending. Billionaire Bill Ackman at Pershing Square recently told clients, \"We believe concerns around Meta's AI-related spending initiatives are underestimating the company's long-term upside potential from AI.\" For instance, Meta dominates the nascent smart glasses market and sees an opportunity to combine smart glasses with superintelligence to create a product that could eventually replace many smartphone functions. Wall Street estimates the company's earnings will increase at 19% annually over the next three years, which makes the current valuation of 27 times earnings look quite reasonable. Stanley Druckenmiller may have sold Meta due to concerns about the near-term implications of heavy AI spending, but investors with a time horizon of five years should consider buying a position today. Story continues Amazon: The stock Stanley Druckenmiller bought in the fourth quarter Amazon has a strong position in three large industries: It operates the largest e-commerce marketplace in North America and Western Europe, it is the largest retail advertiser in the world (and the third-largest adtech company overall), and Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest public cloud in terms of infrastructure and platform services spending. Like Meta, Amazon is leaning into strength in its core markets by investing aggressively in AI. The company has developed hundreds of generative AI applications to improve margins across its retail business, including tools that optimize demand forecasting, inventory placement, workforce productivity, robot efficiency, and last-mile delivery routes. Similarly, AWS has introduced new products and services at every layer of the computing stack: custom AI chips for training and inference workloads at the infrastructure layer, developer tools for creating generative AI and machine learning software at the platform layer, and AI agents for coding, performance monitoring, and security at the application layer. The stock is down 12% since the company announced fourth-quarter earnings, primarily because Amazon plans to spend $200 billion on capital expenditures in 2026 , up 56% from 2025. But investments in AI are bearing fruit: In the fourth quarter, AWS sales accelerated to the fastest pace in 13 quarters, driven in part by triple-digit sales growth in custom chips. And excluding one-time charges, operating margin increased 1.5 percentage points. Wall Street expects Amazon's earnings to increase at 17% annually over the next three years, which makes the current valuation of 29 times earnings look attractive. I think Stanley Druckenmiller made the right call in buying shares in the fourth quarter, and long-term investors should consider doing the same right now. Should you buy stock in Amazon right now?

The company is increasingly advancing deployments in Canada and Texas. Amid the expansion drive, on February 6, research firm Citizens reiterated a Market Outperform rating on IREN Ltd and an $80 price target. Citizens have expressed confidence in IREN Ltd’s long-term prospects amid a strategic pivot from Bitcoin mining to providing higher-quality data center capacity to large-scale customers. The company already has over 2 gigawatts of capacity available to pursue contracts with hyperscalers. In addition, IREN has secured a $3.6 billion in GPU financing for its Microsoft contract on February 5. The financing will supplement Microsoft’s $1.9 billion prepayment, thereby allowing the company to cover 95% of GPU-related capital expenditures for its targeted 140,000-GPU expansion. The expansion drive is expected to deliver $3.4 billion in annual recurring revenue. Iren Limited (NASDAQ:IREN) operates data centers powered by renewable energy, specializing in high-performance computing for artificial intelligence (AI) cloud services and Bitcoin mining. The company recently shifted focus to AI infrastructure, securing major deals, including a $9.7 billion partnership with Microsoft.

(NASDAQ: PRAX ) is one of the best stocks to buy and hold for the next 6 months . On February 10, Guggenheim raised its price target for Praxis Precision Medicines Inc. (NASDAQ:PRAX) to $800 from $760 while reiterating a Buy rating. Praxis Precision Medicines, Inc. (PRAX) Gains Analyst Confidence With Ulixacaltamide The research firm raised its price target, impressed by the significant market opportunity for ulixacaltamide, the company’s flagship treatment for essential tremor (ET). According to Guggenheim, Praxis Precision is well-positioned to capitalize on one of the largest and underpenetrated markets in neurology. The essential tremor market is valued at over $15 billion, and Praxis Precision is poised to achieve peak sales of $5- $10 billion with ulixacaltamide. Earlier on January 28, Piper Sandler raised the stock’s price target to $1200 from $450 while maintaining an Overweight rating. The significant price target hike is in response to ulixacaltamide’s significant success in essential tremor. In addition, the research firm has touted progress in relutrigine and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs). The research firm expects the company to achieve more than $20 billion in revenue with less than 5% peak market share. Praxis Precision Medicines, Inc.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Restaurant Dive newsletter . 352 Capital, one of Fat Brands’ creditors, sued the company last week to contest Fat’s attempt to use management fees and other cash to fund operations during the company’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy process. At issue is Fat’s proposed use of securitization receivables, defined as “certain management fees and other residual amounts payable to FAT Brands as manager of the securitization entities,” according to lawsuit. 352 Capital said that it owns these receivables and Fat cannot use this cash to fund its operations. If 352 Capital wins this case, Fat, which owns Fatburger, Round Table Pizza, Fazzoli’s and more than a dozen other chains, could have difficulty paying for its operations during the bankruptcy process. The creditor, which holds over $100 million of Fat’s debt, has taken issue with Fat Brands in the past. Days before Fat Brands filed for bankruptcy protections on Jan. 27, 352 Capital sued the chain, saying it was owed Class B stocks of Twin Hospitality as collateral for unpaid debt, according to Restaurant Business. Fat Brands and Twin Hospitality declared bankruptcy following months of ongoing talks with various creditors related to more than $1 billion in outstanding debt. The case is complicated as it involves five different securitization trusts secured by different brands. A group of creditors filed an emergency motion in early February calling for CEO Andrew Wiederhorn’s ouster after a $3 million sale of Twin Hospitality stock was completed following the bankruptcy petition date and without court approval. While the emergency motion has been tabled after Fat’s lawyers said issues with corporate governance have been addressed, Wiederhorn’s position could still be contested during an upcoming March court date related to the bankruptcy case, according to a Feb. 10 hearing related to Chapter 11 proceedings.

      "content": "Private equity deals hit $2.6T in 2025 Dan Niepow Thu, February 19, 2026 at 3:27 AM MST 3 min read EA This story was originally published on CFO.com . To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily CFO.com newsletter . For private equity, 2025 was a year of longer hold periods and fewer but bigger deals, and some observers say that may well be a “new normal” for the industry. Last year, total private equity deal value hit $2.6 trillion globally, up 19% over 2024, according to McKinsey & Company’s Global Private Markets 2026 report released last week. That marked the second-highest value on record, said McKinsey Senior Partner Alexander Edlich in a webinar on Wednesday. A $55 billion deal to take video game maker Electronic Arts private — said to be the largest PE deal in history — certainly played a role in driving up the overall value of deals last year. That all came even as the total global deal count dropped 9% in 2025, mirroring trends in the wider M&A market . According to McKinsey’s research, deal count has been falling every year after reaching a relative peak of about 80,000 deals in 2021. At the same time, private equity firms are now finding themselves holding onto assets much longer than they have in the past. McKinsey’s research pointed to a backlog of about 16,000 portfolio companies that have been owned by private equity for over four years in 2025. That was up from about 13,000 such companies in 2024. “The backlog of PE-owned companies still on the books has never been bigger,” McKinsey researchers wrote in the report. “Holding periods also remain well above historical levels. The typical company in the portfolio of a general partner is now held on average for more than six and a half years.” In Wednesday’s webinar, Edlich said that, comparatively, that’s essentially like “two holds almost.” Investors and limited partners are, of course, still looking for their return on investment. The use of continuation vehicles, where private equity firms essentially sell their assets back to themselves, proved to be another popular way to do that last year, though the practice is not without controversy . “Liquidity solutions, like GP-led secondary transactions (the majority of which are continuation vehicles), have more than tripled in value in the last five years, rising from $35 billion in 2020 to $115 billion in 2025,” McKinsey officials said, noting that it's estimated that about 14% of all sponsor-backed exits go through continuation vehicles. “…liquidity for investors remains more a trickle than a flood,” they said. “Trends that first appeared to be ‘niche’ or temporary solutions after the dealmaking exuberance of 2020 and 2021, including the growth in secondaries, the rise of continuation vehicles, and the emergence of net asset value lending, now appear to be enduring — even growing—elements of this more technically demanding private equity terrain.” Story Continues McKinsey’s team said the research all shows that private equity is “maturing” as an industry, for better or worse. “Private equity now exhibits many of the signs of a much more mature industry that is much more technical and much more demanding,” Edlich said. “This is not your grandfather or grandmother’s private equity.” As the company put it in the report: “At present, a strong case can be made that the traditional five-year holding period is in the rearview mirror, and new, adaptive liquidity solutions will remain a permanent and significant part of private markets infrastructure going forward.” Recommended Reading McKinsey’s new AI hiring experiment puts pressure on the ‘up-or-out’ model Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard More Info",

It offers a wide range of financial products that help people save, borrow, and invest their money. The stock has been sluggish to start the year and is down by 3%, but its long-term returns are solid. The bank stock is up by more than 50% during the past five years and has a 2.1% dividend yield. Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » This same financial stock is approaching a $400 billion market cap, which will make it harder for the company to deliver life-changing returns for new investors. People who want exposure to the financial sector and a promising long-term pick may want to consider SoFi (NASDAQ: SOFI) instead. Here's why. This small fintech company is delivering tremendous growth Image source: Getty Images. SoFi is larger than most fintech companies , but its $25 billion market cap looks small when you compare it to Bank of America. Its online banking solutions let it offer higher interest rates on deposits and have more competitive products than traditional banks, which have higher overhead costs as a result of operating large networks of physical branch offices. The online bank delivered 40% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter and secured its ninth consecutive quarter of profitability. SoFi's adjusted net income almost tripled year over year. This metric is more valuable than net income for this particular quarter, since SoFi had a one-time income tax benefit in Q4 2024 that distorts the year-over-year net income comparison. SoFi's revenue and net income are growing at faster rates than those of Bank of America and other traditional banks. As more people tap into the benefits of online banking, SoFi should continue to gain market share and wind up with a more attractive price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio over time. Here's what is fueling those numbers SoFi's growth rates are good, and its underlying business suggests it can maintain those gains. The fintech company has 13.7 million customers after adding 1 million new members in Q4. That's the most customers SoFi has added in a single quarter, highlighting the growing mainstream acceptance of online banks. The company is also delivering solid results across multiple product categories. Just like any traditional bank, SoFi helps people save, borrow, and invest money. The company also recently tapped into cryptocurrencies again, which can turn into a long-term tailwind once Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) regains its momentum. SoFi said it closed the year with 63,441 crypto products, which means that many SoFi members are using crypto trading. Story Continues SoFi also saw strong demand across its product categories, with bank accounts, investment accounts, and credit card openings up by 33%, 28%, and 56% year over year, respectively. SoFi's products are getting more popular, and all that visibility directly translates into revenue and net income gains that can help the fintech stock outperform Bank of America and its peers.

Best money market account rates today, February 19, 2026 (earn up to 4.01% APY) Find out which banks are offering the best MMA rates right now. Casey Bond · Lead Editor and Content Strategist, Banking Thu, February 19, 2026 at 4:00 AM MST 4 min read Find out which banks are offering the best MMA rates right now. As interest rates begin to fall following the Fed’s recent rate cuts, it’s more important than ever to ensure you’re earning a competitive rate on your savings. One option you may want to consider is a money market account (MMA). These accounts are similar to savings accounts — they offer interest on your balance, but may also include a debit card and/or check-writing capabilities. Wondering where the top money market account rates can be found today? Here’s what you need to know. What are the best money market account rates today? From a historical perspective, money market account interest rates have been quite high. The national average interest rate for money market accounts is just 0.56%, according to the FDIC, but the top money market account rates often pay above 4% APY or even more — similar to the rates offered on high-yield savings accounts . Here’s a look at some of the top MMA rates available today: TotalBank Online Money Market Deposit Account : 4.01% APY ($2,500 minimum balance required to earn highest rate) Quontic Bank : 4% APY Brilliant Bank Surge Money Market Account : 4% APY ($1,000 minimum balance required to earn highest rate) Northern Bank Direct Mon­ey Mar­ket Pre­mier Account : 4% APY Zynlo Money Market Account : 3.9% APY Redneck Bank Mega Money Market : 3.85% APY EverBank Yield Pledge Money Market Account : 3.8% APY HUSTL Digital Credit Union Money Market : 3.8% First Foundation Bank Online Money Market Account : 3.75% APY ($1,000 minimum balance required to earn highest rate) Prime Alliance Bank Personal Money Market Account : 3.75% APY Will money market account rates keep going down? Between July 2023 and September 2024, the Fed maintained a target range for its federal funds rate of 5.25%–5.50%. However, as inflation cooled and the economy improved, the Fed slashed the federal funds rate three times that year. In 2025, the Fed made three additional rate cuts. As a result the federal funds rate now stands at 3.50% -3.75%. Deposit account rates have been on a steady decline, meaning now might be the last chance for savers to take advantage of today’s higher rates.

Even so, deciding whether it’s the right time to put money in a money market account also depends on your financial goals and the broader economic conditions. Here are some key factors to consider: Liquidity needs: Money market accounts offer easy access to your money since they often come with check-writing capabilities or debit card access (though there may be a cap on monthly withdrawals). If you need to keep your money accessible while still earning a decent yield, a money market account could be ideal. Savings goals: If you have short-term savings goals or want to build an emergency fund, a money market account can provide a safer place for your cash, with returns that are better than most traditional savings accounts. Risk tolerance: For conservative savers who prefer to avoid the ups and downs of the stock market, money market accounts are appealing because they are backed by FDIC insurance and can’t lose principal. However, if you’re saving for a long-term goal like retirement, riskier investments are necessary to generate higher returns that will get you to your savings target. Given that interest rates are still elevated, now could be a good time to consider a money market account, especially if you’re seeking a balance of safety, liquidity, and better returns than traditional savings accounts. Comparing rates from different institutions will help you find the best options available. Today's money market account rates: Frequently asked questions What is the current interest rate on a money market account? Today's money market account rates vary quite a bit across different financial institutions. Though the national average rate for an MMA is currently 0.56%, there are some banks offering well above 4% APY. In general, you won't find money market rates above 4.5%. Where can I get 7% interest on my money? Unfortunately, there are very few accounts that offer 7% interest . Those that do exist are limited-time promotions, and are typically found on checking accounts. There are currently no money market accounts that pay 7%.

      "content": "ICE Is at the Truck Stops. Is Your Hiring Process Ready? Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves) Rob Carpenter Thu, February 19, 2026 at 3:58 AM MST 13 min read On February 18, 2026, FreightWaves founder Craig Fuller reported that ICE agents in sprinter vans are showing up at truck stops and rounding up undocumented drivers, collecting more than 30 in a single two-hour sweep at one location. In a follow-up post, Fuller warned shippers directly: if your driver is arrested, your cargo will be stranded at an unknown location, unsecured, and likely unrecoverable. The freight industry reacted as if this were breaking news. It isn’t. At TruckSafe Consulting , we’ve been sounding this alarm for years, not because we predicted the exact moment ICE would roll sprinter vans into a Pilot, but because the legal infrastructure for such enforcement has existed for decades and has been expanding at an unprecedented rate. It’s called the 287(g) program, and if you don’t know what it is, you are already behind. The 287(g) Program and Why This Was Always Coming Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to deputize state and local law enforcement officers to perform the functions of federal immigration agents. This is not a new program. The first agreement was signed in 2002 with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. What is new is the scale. As of February 18, 2026, ICE has signed 1,427 Memorandums of Agreement for 287(g) programs covering 40 states. To put that number in perspective: during Trump’s first term in 2019, only 45 of these agreements were signed. Over 1,130 were signed in 2025 alone. The program has gone from a niche enforcement tool to a nationwide apparatus. There are three operational models under 287(g), and the one that should concern every motor carrier in America is the Task Force Model: Task Force Model (TFM), 809 agencies: This is the one that matters most for trucking. Under the TFM, deputized officers can stop, question, and make arrests for immigration violations during their routine policing duties. That means the state trooper who pulls your driver over for a pre-trip inspection deficiency, the officer working a weigh station, or the local deputy responding to a fender bender in a truck stop parking lot, if they operate under a 287(g) TFM agreement, they have the authority to act as immigration enforcement on the spot. Warrant Service Officer Model (WSO), 465 agencies: Trains and authorizes officers to serve and execute administrative immigration warrants within jails and correctional facilities. Jail Enforcement Model (JEM), 152 agencies: Allows officers to screen individuals booked into local jails for immigration status and issue detainers to hold them for ICE. Story Continues Add those together: 1,427 agencies across 40 states now have some form of deputized immigration enforcement authority. DHS is actively recruiting more staff through a new reimbursement program that covers salary and benefits for participating agencies. This is not slowing down. It is accelerating. What This Means for Trucking It is no longer just ICE agents at truck stops who can take your driver off the road. Under the Task Force Model, any deputized local or state officer encountered during a routine traffic stop, a roadside inspection, a weigh station check, or a crash response can initiate immigration enforcement action. Your driver doesn’t have to be at a truck stop. Your driver doesn’t have to be targeted in a sweep. Your driver just has to be pulled over for a burned-out marker light in one of the 809 jurisdictions operating under a TFM agreement, and the officer has the authority to question immigration status and make an arrest. This is why we at TruckSafe have long advocated that carriers must properly screen and qualify their drivers from both compliance and risk perspectives. The 287(g) infrastructure didn’t appear overnight. We watched it grow. We warned our clients. And now the freight industry at large is waking up to a reality we’ve been preparing for all along. Compliant Is Not Defensible Meeting the minimum regulatory requirements for driver qualification does not make you defensible. It makes you compliant. Those are two very different things. Compliant means you checked the boxes required under 49 CFR Part 391. You pulled an MVR. You got a medical card. You ran a pre-employment drug test. You have a driver qualification file. Defensible means that when a plaintiff’s attorney deposes your safety director after a catastrophic crash, or when ICE arrests your driver, and your shipper’s $200,000 load of pharmaceuticals is sitting unattended at a Love’s in Midland, Texas, you can demonstrate that your hiring process was thorough, objective, consistently applied, and designed to identify risk before it materialized. The carrier that simply meets the minimum standard is the carrier that gets destroyed in litigation. The carrier that builds a defensible screening program is the one that survives. The Real-World Consequences Are Already Here We work with some of the largest Fortune 500 companies in the world. We recently worked with a client whose non-domiciled CDL driver was pulled over at a weigh station in Texas and arrested. The load was stranded. The shipper was furious. The insurance company started asking questions. The carrier was left scrambling to explain how this driver ended up behind the wheel of its truck in the first place. This pattern will accelerate not only because of ICE sweeps at truck stops, but also because the 809 Task Force Model agencies can now initiate immigration enforcement during any routine encounter with a CMV driver within their jurisdiction. The consequences extend far beyond the immediate disruption: Cargo claims. The shipper files a claim for the full value of the stranded, potentially spoiled, or stolen freight. Your cargo insurance may or may not cover a load abandoned due to a driver’s arrest. Authority risk. Repeated incidents of this nature attract the attention of the FMCSA. Compliance reviews follow. Conditional ratings follow. Authority revocation follows. Insurance exposure. Your insurer will audit your hiring practices. If they find gaps, and they will find gaps, expect non-renewal, premium increases, or policy rescission. Litigation exposure. If that driver was involved in a crash before or after the arrest, the plaintiff’s attorney will use your inadequate screening as evidence of negligent hiring. Nuclear verdicts start here. Broker and shipper fallout. Freight brokers are already starting to vet carriers more aggressively. Shippers will demand proof of defensible hiring practices as a condition of doing business. What a Defensible Driver Screening Program Looks Like Here is what we build for our clients at TruckSafe. This is not a suggestion list. This is the standard. Each of these steps should be completed before a driver is dispatched on their first load. 1. Complete and Signed Driver Application (49 CFR §391.21) The application must be complete, signed, dated, and include all driver-specific disclosures required by regulation. Gaps in employment history must be investigated and documented. A half-completed application is not a minor oversight; it is the first red flag a plaintiff’s attorney will wave in front of a jury. 2. Motor Vehicle Record (MVR) Review (49 CFR §391.23) Pull MVRs from every state where the driver has held a license in the past three years. Review for license class, endorsements, restrictions, suspensions, moving violations, DUIs, and accident history. This review must be conducted by a designated reviewer and signed off under 49 CFR §391.27. Do not accept the driver’s word for their driving history. Verify everything. 3. FMCSA Pre-Employment Screening Program (PSP) Report The PSP report gives you federally reported crash and inspection data. Review crash history, inspection history, and out-of-service events.

Casey Bond · Lead Editor and Content Strategist, Banking Thu, February 19, 2026 at 4:00 AM MST 4 min read If you’re looking to supercharge your savings, a high-yield savings account could provide an above-average return to help your balance grow faster. However, not all banks offer high savings account rates, which is why it’s important to shop around and find the most competitive savings interest rates available. Read on to learn more about where to find the best savings interest rates today. Banks with the best savings interest rates today Savings account rates have been trending down since 2024, when the Federal Reserve began cutting the federal funds rate. The good news is that many high-yield savings accounts still offer rates of around 4% APY and up. The best rates are typically offered by online banks, although you may be able to find comparable savings interest rates at some credit unions and community banks. As of February 19, 2026, the highest savings account rate available from our partners is 4% APY. This rate is offered by SoFi*, Barclays, and Valley Direct. Here is a look at some of the best savings interest rates available today from our verified partners: How do I choose the best savings account? Selecting a savings account with a competitive interest rate is important. The higher the rate, the faster your balance will grow over time. That said, the interest rate shouldn't be your only point of comparison. Other factors, such as fees, ATM locations, the bank's reputation, and more should also be considered. The best savings accounts offer a combination of high rates, low fees, accessibility, and an overall positive banking experience. Not sure where to start? Check out our ranking of the 10 best high-yield savings accounts available today. Savings account interest rate forecast Following several years of near-zero interest rates, the Federal Reserve began raising the the federal funds rate in 2022 in order to combat rapidly rising inflation. As a result, savings interest rates skyrocketed, reaching a 15-year high. However, in late 2024, the Fed implemented a series of cuts to the federal funds rate, and savings account rates started dropping. At the end of 2025, the Fed cut rates for a third time, with additional rate cuts expected in the coming months. It’s difficult to predict exactly how and when interest rates will change going forward, but one thing is for sure: Today’s high savings account rates won’t last forever. So, if you’re hoping to give your savings a boost and take advantage of the best rates on the market, there’s no better time than now. How to open a savings account The requirements involved in opening a savings account vary by financial institution. However, if you’re ready to open an account, you can follow these general steps: Research savings account rates: Of course, when choosing a savings account, one of the most important factors to evaluate are the interest rates. Be sure that you select a savings account with a competitive rate to help your money grow. Figure out your must-haves: Although savings account interest rates should be top of mind, that’s not the only factor to consider. You’ll also want to think about what else you need from your account, whether it’s no minimum balance requirement , low fees, or other perks. Finding a savings account with a solid rate that also helps you achieve your goals is key. Prepare documentation: Opening a bank account requires you to provide a few important personal details and documents. Before you start your application, be sure you have your Social Security number, driver’s license or passport number, and proof of address. Fill out the application: In many cases, you can apply for savings account online. However, some financial institutions may require you to visit the branch in person to apply. Either way, the application for a new savings account should only take a few minutes to complete. In many cases, you’ll get your approval decision instantly. Fund your account: Once your savings account application is approved, you’ll need to add funds to the account. Be sure you’re aware of any minimum opening deposit requirements and timeline for funding.

Casey Bond · Lead Editor and Content Strategist, Banking Thu, February 19, 2026 at 4:00 AM MST 3 min read Find out which banks are offering the best CD rates right now. If you’re looking for a secure place to store your savings, a certificate of deposit (CD) may be a great choice. These accounts often provide higher interest rates than traditional checking and savings accounts. However, CD rates can vary widely. Learn more about where CD rates stand today and how to find the best rates available. Banks with the best CD rates today CD rates are relatively high compared to historical averages. That said, CD rates have been on the decline since last year when the Federal Reserve began cutting its target rate. The good news is that several financial institutions offer competitive rates of 4% APY and up, particularly online banks. Today, the highest CD rate is 4% APY. This rate is offered by Marcus by Goldman Sachs on its 1-year CD. Here is a look at some of the best CD rates available today from our verified partners: CD rate predictions for 2026 The Federal Reserve began decreasing the federal funds rate in light of slowing inflation and an overall improved economic outlook. It cut its target rate three times in late 2024 by a total of one percentage point. In December, the Fed announced its third rate cut of 2025 and additional cuts could be on the horizon in 2026. However, it's uncertain when that will happen and how many cuts the Fed plans to make. The federal funds rate doesn’t directly impact deposit interest rates, though they are correlated. When the Fed lowers rates, financial institutions typically follow suit (and vice versa). So now that the Fed has lowered its rate, CD rates are beginning to fall again. That’s why now may be a good time to put your money in a CD and lock in today’s best rates. How to open a CD The process for opening a CD account varies by financial institution. However, there are a few general steps you can expect to follow: Research CD rates: One of the most important factors to consider when opening a CD is whether the account provides a competitive rate. You can easily compare CD rates online to find the best offers. Choose an account that meets your needs: While a CD’s interest rate is a key consideration, it shouldn’t be the only one. You should also evaluate the CD’s term length, minimum opening deposit requirements, and fees to ensure a particular account fits your financial needs and goals. For example, you want to avoid choosing a CD term that’s too long, otherwise you’ll be subject to an early withdrawal penalty if you need to pull out your funds before the CD matures. Get your documents ready: When opening a bank account, you will need to provide a few pieces of information, including your Social Security number, address, and driver’s license or passport number. Having these documents on hand will help streamline the application process. Complete the application: These days, many financial institutions allow you to apply for an account online, though you might have to visit the branch in some cases. Either way, the application for a new CD should only take a few minutes to complete. And in many cases, you’ll get your approval decision instantly. Fund the account: Once your CD application is approved, it’s time to fund the account. This can usually be done by transferring money from another account or mailing a check.

      "content": "Oil companies jostle for projects to boost Venezuelan output quickly; a real grind awaits Oil platforms and pumpjacks at Lake Maracaibo in Cabimas, Venezuela, January 26, 2026. REUTERS/Leonardo Fernandez Viloria · Reuters By Mariela Nava , Marianna Parraga and Ana Isabel Martinez Thu, February 19, 2026 at 4:06 AM MST 10 min read CL=F By Mariela Nava , Marianna Parraga and Ana Isabel Martinez CABIMAS, Venezuela, Feb 19 (Reuters) - In September, a rig used to drill wells in shallow waters completed the long trip from China to Venezuela's oil-producing region of Lake Maracaibo. The passage of the big old rig named Alula just inches below the bridge connecting Maracaibo city with the oilfields of the lake's eastern coast stirred excitement among residents and workers: they had not seen any new drilling equipment arrive for years due to U.S. sanctions. The rig hit an oil pipeline as it passed through the lake and over the metallic spaghetti of 20,000 kilometers of pipes beneath the waters. Crude leaked for months before repairs could be made and the rig installed at the polluted lake late last year. The crude production increase has been small ‌since then. The story of the Alula is a cautionary tale for the foreign energy companies such as U.S. oil major Chevron that are looking to quickly expand in Venezuela and take on the short-term projects needed to boost the country's oil output. Each step forward often brings a new host of challenges. Other foreign companies with a toehold in the country include Spain's Repsol, Italy's ENI, France's Maurel&Prom and China National Petroleum Corp. U.S. ‌President Donald Trump wants American companies to spend $100 billion to rebuild an oil industry that has suffered 20 years of neglect, mismanagement and underinvestment under the socialist presidents Hugo Chavez and Nicolas Maduro. Washington has been easing sanctions since its military incursion to snatch Maduro in early January by issuing a handful of general licenses that allow energy companies to export, import, invest and operate oil and gas projects in the OPEC member. Early expansions could lead to the South American country adding as much as 500,000 barrels a day (bpd) of crude output in as little as six months from a current ​1 million bpd, two executives from companies with assets there said. U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said this month from Caracas he expects a \"dramatic increase\" in Venezuela's production in the coming months. The U.S. oil capital of Houston and Venezuela's oil regions, meanwhile, are abuzz, mobilizing for an oil rush and for the business opportunities on offer to participate in one of the biggest repair jobs the energy industry has ever seen. It is an effort on the scale of work to boost Iraq's production after the second Gulf War or to rehabilitate the Kuwaiti oilfields torched by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Story Continues According to half a dozen industry workers, oil employees with experience in Venezuela and executives planning to work there, and numerous industry experts and analysts interviewed by Reuters for this story, the first phase in Venezuela would involve some relatively straightforward projects to get more oil flowing quickly: using rigs already in the country, refurbishing dilapidated wells and crude upgraders that are working below capacity, and repairing ports and pipelines operated by state oil company PDVSA. But even the easy projects are tough, they said, and after that, the work will get even harder. In early February, a Reuters reporter who toured the Lake Maracaibo area saw oil industry junk, tanks overflowing with crude, abandoned oilfields, blackened shorelines, and long lines of vehicles to buy gasoline close to storage terminals and operational sites run by PDVSA. They were all visible reminders of how much work lies ahead, even to pick what might be regarded as the low-hanging fruit, in the region that is home ‌to Venezuela's oldest production facilities and has the country's second-largest output capacity. THE FIRST STEPS Among the first steps companies foresee would be to execute projects like the one planned ⁠by China Concord Resources Corp, which brought the Alula rig to Venezuela last year. The firm aims to increase a combination of light and heavy oil production from two fields to 60,000 bpd by the end of this year from 16,000 bpd in December through a $1 billion program that would require refurbishing as many as 875 inactive wells before new wells can be drilled. The company is now fixing many unplanned issues, from insufficient supply of the gas needed to maintain pressure at wells, to the loss of key technical data and lack of transportation for workers, a source from the project said, adding that those obstacles have prevented it from reaching output targets. It is unclear if that project will proceed after Trump said companies from U.S. rivals ⁠on the global political stage - China, Russia and Iran - were no longer welcome in Venezuela. Under sanctions, companies from those countries were among the few that were willing to work there. In contrast, Chevron - for years the only U.S. major producing crude in the country - is in prime position to achieve early gains. The company needs the type of light crude that China Concord is pumping and is competing with rivals to secure supplies in Lake Maracaibo. Light oil and fuel that can dilute Venezuela's tar-like oil are precious commodities for energy companies working in Venezuela. Without expensive crude upgraders or diluents, the country's massive reserves of extra heavy crude cannot be transported or exported. The promise of relatively easy to produce barrels is increasing the appetite of foreign oil companies for work in highly polluted or technically complex regions like Lake Maracaibo and Monagas North, which state company PDVSA has neglected in recent decades as part of its strategy to keep the focus on the prolific and heavy-oil rich Orinoco Belt further southeast. Oil from around Maracaibo could also be cheaper for Chevron to produce than from other ​regions in Venezuela, ​especially as crude prices remain low, because it does not need to be treated before export, said a former employee who worked on the Venezuela operations. Other options include reopening existing wells shut down due to lack of specialized equipment or power supply, reconditioning low-performing wells to ​increase output, and drilling new wells, the former employee said, adding that Chevron would likely have a long list of new well locations under consideration. Chevron said it \"has been a part ‌of Venezuela's past and remains committed to working in partnership for its future,\" adding that it welcomes recent U.S. licenses and legal reforms in Venezuela. The country's oil ministry and PDVSA did not reply to requests for comment. China Concord could not be immediately reached for comment. HEAVIER ORINOCO CRUDE Companies with oil contracts and project stakes across the country are jostling for access to specialized equipment already there. There are up to 14 drilling rigs that have been in storage for years in Venezuela and are owned by Houston-headquartered SLB, one of the top global oil service providers, three sources with knowledge of its assets said. SLB has been the main service provider to Chevron since it began its most recent drilling program in Venezuela in 2024 as part of a previous U.S. broad license. Like the U.S. major, SLB has many years of experience in the country. The rigs that SLB has in Venezuela were deployed for PDVSA projects before the U.S. imposed sanctions in 2019. After that, U.S. companies and those abiding by U.S. sanctions could not operate rigs or specialized equipment there. SLB said it continues to have operational facilities, equipment and staff in Venezuela, and is in \"the early stages of collaboration\" with customers on next steps. \"We are confident that under the right conditions and safety environment, we can ramp up activities ",

Trey Thoelcke Thu, February 19, 2026 at 8:45 AM EST 4 min read WFC C C-PR Quick Read Wells Fargo (WFC) fell 5% since January 1 while Citigroup (C) barely slipped after their January 14 earnings. Wells Fargo’s Federal Reserve asset cap removal enables unrestricted deposit and loan growth. Wells Fargo raised equity return targets to 17-18%. Citigroup’s net income fell 13.8% to $2.5B as operating expenses rose 6% from compensation and technology costs. A recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here . Wells Fargo ( NYSE: WFC ) and Citigroup ( NYSE: C ) both reported Q4 2025 earnings on January 14, 2026, yet investors sold off both stocks despite solid results. The selloff reflects concern over net interest income pressure in a higher-for-longer rate environment. Since January 1, 2026, Wells Fargo has declined 4.98% while Citigroup has slipped just 0.36%, revealing how different business models respond to the same rate backdrop. How the Quarter Landed: Asset Cap Removal vs. Cost Restructuring Wells Fargo delivered $21.29 billion in revenue and $1.76 EPS, topping earnings expectations but falling short on the top line. Its Consumer, Small & Business Banking segment rose 9% to $6.59 billion, while Credit Card climbed 7% to $1.38 billion. CEO Charlie Scharf called the removal of the Federal Reserve asset cap transformational: \"Strong financial performance, removal of the asset cap [...] and stronger growth in both our consumer and commercial businesses make me proud of our 2025 results.\" Net interest income grew 4% year-over-year on higher loan balances and fixed-rate asset repricing. Citigroup posted $19.90 billion in revenue and $1.19 EPS, missing both estimates. Net income fell 13.8% to $2.5 billion, weighed down by 6% higher operating expenses tied to compensation, legal, and technology costs. Banking revenues surged 78% and Services rose 15%, but Markets slipped 1%. CEO Jane Fraser's restructuring included 1,000 job cuts in January 2026. The bank's presence in 180+ countries provides diversification but also exposes it to geopolitical volatility. One Bet on Domestic Growth, One on Global Reach With the asset cap lifted, Wells Fargo can grow deposits and loans without regulatory constraint. Management raised its medium-term return on tangible common equity target to 17% to 18% from 15%, expects mid-single-digit loan and deposit growth in 2026, and anticipates two more Fed rate cuts. The 10Y-2Y yield curve spread at 0.64% supports net interest margin expansion, though further cuts could compress that advantage. Story Continues Citigroup leans into institutional banking, cross-border services, and wealth management. Its $208 billion market cap reflects a lower valuation than Wells Fargo's $278 billion, with Citi trading at 1.06x book value versus Wells Fargo's 1.64x. Fraser's turnaround targets a lower expense base while protecting Services and Banking revenue, though Russia-related tax impacts continue to surface. Metric Wells Fargo Citigroup Dividend Yield 1.95% 2.06% Q4 Buybacks + Dividends $6.4B $5.6B Price-to-Book 1.64x 1.06x Why Wells Fargo Edges Ahead for Income Wells Fargo increased its quarterly dividend 13% over 2025 to $0.45 and repurchased $5.0 billion in stock during Q4 alone. Citigroup's 2.06% yield is slightly higher, but declining net income and rising expenses cloud the picture. Wells Fargo's domestic focus also insulates it from geopolitical risk. For those drawn to a turnaround play, Citi's discount to book value offers appeal, though the restructuring timeline remains uncertain. Trump's proposed credit card interest rate cap poses a shared risk, though Wells Fargo's diversified consumer banking portfolio may absorb it better than Citi's card-heavy U.S. personal banking segment. Data Shows One Habit Doubles American’s Savings And Boosts Retirement Most Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t. And no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it’s shocking more people don’t adopt the habit given how easy it is . Terms and Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices More Info",

Headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, it coordinates global delivery and e-commerce activities. The company has a market capitalization of $88.24 billion. Based on strong analyst sentiment regarding FedEx’s strategic success, the company has the potential to capitalize on growing demand for logistics and delivery services. Over the past 52 weeks, the stock has gained 43.2%, and it is up 32.6% year-to-date (YTD).  FedEx’s shares reached a high of $383.59 on Feb. 18, and are only down marginally from that level.

The S&P 500 index ($SPX) is up 12.3% over the past 52 weeks and is up marginally YTD. Therefore, the stock has outperformed the broader market over these periods. Compared with FedEx’s own sector, we also observe outperformance. The State Street Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLI) has increased 26.3% over the past 52 weeks, while it has rallied 12.8% YTD. www.barchart.com For the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (quarter ended Nov. 30), FedEx’s revenue increased 7% year-over-year (YOY) to $23.47 billion, which is higher than the $22.86 billion that Wall Street analysts had expected. The topline growth is based on Federal Express segment revenue increasing 8% to $20.43 billion in the prior-year period, driven by higher U.S. domestic and International Priority package yields, ongoing cost reductions from transformation efforts, lower business optimization expenses, and rising U.S. domestic package volumes. FedEx’s adjusted EPS for the quarter was $4.82, up 19% YOY and higher than the expected $4.07 figure. For the current quarter, Street analysts expect FedEx’s profit to decrease 8.7% YOY to $4.12 per diluted share, while for the current fiscal year, it is expected to increase 1.6% to $18.48 per diluted share, followed by a 16.5% growth to $21.52 per diluted share in the following fiscal year. The company also has a solid history of surpassing consensus estimates, topping them in three of the four trailing quarters. Story Continues Among the 27 Wall Street analysts covering FedEx’s stock, the consensus is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on 17 “Strong Buy” ratings, two “Moderate Buys,” seven “Holds,” and one “Moderate Sell.” The ratings configuration has become more bullish than a month ago, with the number of “Strong Buy” ratings increasing from 15 to 17. www.barchart.com This month, TD Cowen analyst Jason H. Seidl reaffirmed a “Buy” rating for FedEx while raising the price target from $313 to $383, while Wells Fargo analyst Christian Wetherbee maintained an “Overweight” rating while raising the price target from $380 to $430. FedEx’s mean price target of $365.85 indicates a 4.5% downside over current market prices. However, the Street-high price target of $479 implies a potential upside of 25%.

U.S. utilities have invested heavily to upgrade electric grids as they face ‌extreme weather and growing demand from power-hungry data centers dedicated to AI and cryptocurrency, alongside a shift by homes and businesses toward electric ​heating and transport. More from Yahoo Scout What factors are driving higher electricity demand nationwide? Why did Southern Co increase its spending plan? What major tech companies contracted with Southern Co? How will Southern Co expand its power generation capacity? \"We're in the midst of a watershed moment for the energy industry and our nation,\" Southern Co CEO Chris Womack said on a call with investors. Southern Co expects to spend about $81 billion from 2026 through 2030, compared with its prior five-year plan of $76 billion, with about half of that spending going to boosting power generation. The Atlanta, Georgia-based utility ‌said it had contracted 10 gigawatts ⁠of large-load customers across Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi, including Google, Meta, Microsoft and Compass Datacenters. Its shares rose more than 4% in afternoon trade. Data centers with a combined demand of around ⁠75 gigawatts have expressed interest in connecting to Southern Co's system, executives said on an earnings call with investors. One gigawatt is enough to power about 750,000 homes. Among its plans to expand its power supplies, Southern Co said it could redirect to new ​customers about ​1,000 megawatts of natural gas-fired generation capacity by 2030. It ​is also in late-stage discussions to increase the ‌output of its existing natural gas fleet to create an additional 700 megawatts. \"Southern continues to capitalize on its growth opportunities in a prudent manner,\" Evercore ISI analyst Nicholas Amicucci said. The utility's capital spending and earnings outlook should drive shares higher, while still maintaining upside potential as its service territory in the Southeast U.S. \"continues to see strong demand from large loads seeking grid connection given the region's favorable regulatory environment and affordability,\" he said. Southern Co is the ‌second-largest U.S. utility, with 9 million customers across Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, ​Mississippi, Tennessee and Virginia. In addition to data center demand, extreme weather ​and growing populations in the U.S. South are ​driving up power use. A winter storm in January caused the second-highest winter peak electric load ‌on Southern Co's system, it said. Also on Thursday, ​Southern Co forecast adjusted annual ​profit below analysts' estimates. Story Continues For the quarter ended December 31, Southern Co posted an adjusted profit of 55 cents per share, below analysts' expectations of 57 cents, according to data compiled by LSEG. Its operating expenses jumped ​14.7% during the quarter, while revenue ‌rose 10%. The company expects adjusted profit for 2026 to be between $4.50 and $4.60 per share, with the midpoint ​slightly below the estimate of $4.56 per share.

REUTERS/Chris Helgren · Reuters By Promit Mukherjee Thu, February 19, 2026 at 8:33 AM EST 2 min read By Promit Mukherjee OTTAWA, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Canada's international merchandise trade deficit narrowed in December as exports grew faster than imports, and its share of exports to ‌the United Sates dropped to its lowest level on record barring the COVID-19 ‌months, data showed on Thursday. Statistics Canada said the country posted a C$1.31 billion ($957 million) deficit in December led ​by metals and non-metallic mineral exports. This was in contrast to a revised C$2.59 billion deficit in November. More from Yahoo Scout Why is Canada's trade dependency on US declining? How did non-US trade relationships perform in December? What drove the surge in metals exports? Why did Canada's trade deficit narrow in December? Economists had expected around C$2 billion deficit for December. Total exports rose 2.6% to C$65.63 billion, driven primarily by metals and non-metallic mineral products shipments that grew by 18% in December. ‌Exports of unwrought gold took ⁠the lead in this category with a jump of over 37%, helped by higher prices. However, excluding the metals and non-metallic category, the Canadian exports ⁠edged down 0.2%. In volume terms, total exports were up 1.4%, the statistics agency said. Imports increased 0.6% to C$66.93 billion, with six out of 11 product sections registering a rise. The increase ​was driven ​by imports of gold, passenger vehicles and energy ​products. TRADE WITH THE U.S. Exports to the ‌United States, Canada's largest trading partner, rose 1.1%, accounting for just over 67.4% of total exports, compared with 76.2% a year ago. This was the first time in three months that outbound shipments to the south increased in percentage terms, but the share of exports to the U.S. shrunk to its lowest level in since data collection began, except two months ‌of pandemic in 2020. The share of exports to the ​U.S. was 68.4% in November and 67.5% in October. Imports ​from the U.S., however, rose faster ​by 3.5%, narrowing Canada's merchandise trade surplus with its southern neighbor ‌to C$5.7 billion, from C$6.5 billion in ​November. Meanwhile, exports to countries ​other than the U.S. continued their upward momentum, reaching an all-time high in December. Exports of gold to the United Kingdom led most of the gains. Imports from countries ​other than the United States ‌fell 3% in December and Canada's trade deficit with countries other than the ​United States narrowed to $7 billion in December from $9 billion in November, StatsCan ​said.

Q4 2025 Earnings Call Summary - Moby Performance Attribution and Strategic Context Record revenue of $1.05 billion in 2025 was driven by strategic acquisitions and a record aftermarket parts business, which reached 71% of total revenue. Management attributed the outperformance of aftermarket parts to customers running aging equipment harder to compensate for offline capacity and deferred capital investment. Industrial Processing segment growth was bolstered by the successful integration of Clyde Industries and Babbini, despite relatively soft capital project activity throughout the year. Flow Control performance saw North American strength offset by European weakness, with margins impacted by tariff volatility and product mix shifts. Material Handling delivered solid year-over-year improvements in bookings and margins, supported by modernization efforts in recycling and infrastructure construction. The company achieved record free cash flow of $154 million, allowing for the repayment of approximately 42% of outstanding debt held at the end of 2024. 2026 Outlook and Strategic Assumptions Management adopted a conservative 2026 guidance framework, assuming 1% to 3% organic growth and excluding potential upside from large pending capital projects. The first quarter of 2026 is expected to be the weakest period due to soft capital bookings in the latter half of 2025 and the timing of capital shipments. Capital project activity is projected to strengthen as customers gain economic clarity and address the long-term necessity of productivity-enhancing investments. Guidance excludes the pending acquisition of voestalpine BÖHLER Profil GmbH, which is expected to close in Q1 2026 and will trigger a guidance revision. The company is shifting its reporting methodology to add back recurring intangible amortization to adjusted EPS to better align with cash flow and peer comparisons. Risk Factors and Structural Dynamics Tariff volatility and magnitude were cited as significant challenges in 2025, causing customers to adopt a 'wait-and-see' attitude toward capital expenditures. Geopolitical and macroeconomic instability continue to influence the timing of capital orders, particularly in European and Asian manufacturing sectors. The company anticipates its leverage ratio will increase to just above 2 following the completion of the voestalpine BÖHLER Profil acquisition. Global minimum tax regulations and changes in the geographic distribution of earnings contributed to a higher-than-anticipated tax rate in Q4 2025. Q&A Session Highlights Our analysts just identified a stock with the potential to be the next Nvidia. Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Story Continues Capital project timing and customer sentiment regarding tariffs Management noted that while projects haven't been canceled, customers have delayed commitments due to the chaotic nature of tariff implementations. Customers are now shifting focus toward improving productivity and squeezing efficiency from existing operations rather than adding new capacity. Competitive dynamics in the aftermarket parts sector European and regional competitors are attempting to gain market share through aggressive pricing, but Kadant relies on high technical service levels and 'sticky' relationships to defend its position. Management emphasized that total cost of ownership and technical support are more critical to customers than initial price undercutting. Growth drivers in the Material Handling segment Data center construction is a significant driver, requiring massive amounts of processed natural resources like aggregate, sand, copper, and aluminum. Kadant's equipment is integral to the mining and processing of these materials, benefiting from the current boom in large-scale infrastructure projects. One stock.

Performance was driven by a 'connected portfolio' strategy, allowing the company to capture higher share of wallet by supplying integrated materials and services across the value chain. Strategic alignment with three core megatrends—transportation, water, and reindustrialization—provided a robust demand backdrop despite headwinds in residential sectors. Aggressive capital allocation saw $4.1 billion invested in 38 acquisitions, focusing on high-growth platforms like aggregates, cementitious materials, roads, and water. The 'CRH Winning Way' operational framework enabled the company to maintain pricing momentum and cost discipline, offsetting inflationary pressures in labor and raw materials. Scale serves as a primary differentiator, with 85% of U.S. data centers located within 25 miles of a CRH facility, facilitating rapid response to reindustrialization needs. 2026 Outlook and Strategic Targets 2026 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $8.1 billion to $8.5 billion assumes normal seasonal weather and no major macroeconomic dislocations. Growth assumptions rely on the continued rollout of the IIJA, with approximately 50% of federal highway funds still to be deployed. Management expects $200 million in net incremental EBITDA from 2025 acquisitions, though this will be partially offset by the planned divestment of the Construction Accessories business. Medium-term targets through 2030 include average annual revenue growth of 7% to 9% and an adjusted EBITDA margin target of 22% to 24%. Financial capacity for the next five years is estimated at $40 billion, with 70% intended for growth-oriented M&A and CapEx. Strategic Investments and Portfolio Shifts Integration of Eco Material is progressing ahead of schedule, with early wins in commercial and logistical synergies within the cementitious platform. The planned divestment of the Construction Accessories business is expected to close later in 2026 as part of ongoing portfolio optimization. Invested $1.7 billion in growth CapEx, including a $100 million precast pipe plant in Texas to capitalize on accelerating water infrastructure demand. Shareholder returns remain a priority, with a new $300 million quarterly share buyback tranche commenced and a 5% increase in the quarterly dividend. Q&A Session Insights Our analysts just identified a stock with the potential to be the next Nvidia. Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Story Continues Underlying assumptions for 2026 volume and pricing guidance U.S. aggregates volumes are expected to grow in the low single digits supported by mid-single-digit pricing momentum, while cement is expected to see low single-digit growth in both volumes and pricing. International cement pricing is projected to rise in the low to mid-single digits, marking the ninth consecutive year of increases in European cement. Guidance assumes no recovery in the U.S. residential new-build market, which remains subdued due to affordability challenges. Impact of potential highway bill delays or extensions Management expressed confidence in bipartisan support for a multi-year reauthorization, noting that 2026 DOT budgets are already up 6%. If a 1-year extension occurs instead of a new bill, funding would likely shift toward repair and maintenance (R&M) activities, which management described as a 'sweet spot' for CRH. Synergy realization and M&A pipeline sustainability The 'connected' nature of the portfolio allows CRH to identify synergies that other bidders cannot, often acting as the 'acquirer of choice' due to long-standing local relationships. Synergies in the Australia Adbri acquisition are being delivered earlier and at higher levels than originally anticipated.

Performance was bolstered by the successful refinancing of $1.2 billion in floating rate debt into fixed rate debt, yielding over $8 million in annual cash savings. Management attributes the 113% year-over-year growth in Normalized FFO to strong operational execution and the realization of mark-to-market rent increases. The portfolio remains highly stable with 76% of revenues derived from investment-grade tenants or secure Hawaii land leases, supporting a 94.5% occupancy rate. Strategic focus on deleveraging resulted in a reduction of the net debt leverage ratio from 12.4x to 11.8x over the past year. Deepened relationships with anchor tenants FedEx and Amazon, who together accounted for 38% of the year's total leasing volume. The Hawaii footprint continues to provide a unique competitive advantage for the portfolio, while company-wide same-property cash basis NOI increased year-over-year driven by strong tenant retention and rent roll-ups. 2026 Outlook and Strategic Priorities Management expects continued organic cash flow growth as 55% of 2025 leasing activity has not yet commenced and will contribute in 2026 and beyond. Leasing priorities for 2026 are centered on a 2.2 million square foot land parcel in Hawaii and a 535,000 square foot property in Indianapolis. The company anticipates average rent roll-ups of approximately 20% on the Mainland and 30% in Hawaii based on current pipeline negotiations. Guidance for Q1 2026 assumes interest expense of $61.5 million, with Normalized FFO projected between $0.29 and $0.31 per share. Management plans to exercise the extension option for the $1.4 billion floating rate loan in the consolidated joint venture, extending maturity to March 2027. Financial Adjustments and Risk Factors Incurred a $5.7 million incentive fee payment to the manager in January 2026 due to outperforming the industry benchmark by over 60% over three years. Recognized a $1.4 million net loss from the opportunistic sale of two vacant unencumbered properties totaling 286,000 square feet. A planned $50 million property sale was canceled after the tenant opted to sign a 7-year lease renewal instead of purchasing the asset. The company expects to spend approximately $4 million to purchase a required interest rate cap as part of the joint venture loan extension. Analyst Q&A Highlights Status of significant vacancies in Indianapolis and Hawaii Our analysts just identified a stock with the potential to be the next Nvidia. Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Story Continues Management is currently exchanging lease comments for the Indianapolis space, with a potential lease-up as early as next quarter. The Hawaii parcel remains in discussions with a long-term prospect; delays are attributed to the site's complexity and large scale as a ground lease. Sustainability of same-store NOI growth trends Growth is considered sustainable because many leases are signed 12-18 months in advance, meaning the cash impact of recent high-spread renewals will hit in late 2026 and 2027. Refinancing strategy for the $1.4 billion joint venture loan The company is actively evaluating the macro environment but feels no pressure to rush due to the extension option which carries no extra fees beyond the interest rate cap. The underlying JV portfolio is 100% leased, meaning no operational improvements are required to prepare for a future refinancing. Impact of new supply and market competition on the Mainland Management has not seen new supply as a major issue because construction has slowed and tenants find relocation disruptive and costly. Several tenants who explored relocation options ultimately returned to negotiate renewals for their existing spaces. One stock. Nvidia-level potential. 30M+ investors trust Moby to find it first.

So if you have $3,000 to add to your portfolio now, I'd suggest sticking to growth stocks that are market leaders that have strong moats and that are trading at reasonable valuations. In particular, you could split that investment between these three unstoppable AI stocks and hold onto them for the long term. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks » Nvidia Spending on AI infrastructure continues to soar, as five of the largest hyperscalers (owners of giant data centers) have committed to spending a total of $700 billion this year alone to expand their cloud capacity. To put that in perspective, only 24 countries in the world had gross domestic products higher than that in 2025. One of the biggest beneficiaries of this spending will be Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) . The company has about a 90% share of the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, as its chips are the main processors used to power AI workloads. It has created a wide moat in this arena both through its cutting-edge chip designs and its CUDA software platform, which is where most foundational AI code was written. Meanwhile, it has a strong and growing network platform that enables it to deliver end-to-end AI server solutions. Despite Nvidia's strong continued growth, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just over 23.5, making it a great stock to buy and hold for the long term. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has the most complete AI stack, with both a leading large language model in Gemini and its own world-class custom AI chips in its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Designing some of its own AI chips gives Alphabet a structural cost advantage, allowing it to train and run its AI models more cheaply than competitors. Meanwhile, it is now just starting to let customers lease its TPUs at scale within its cloud computing business, opening up another revenue stream. Anthropic has placed a large TPU order with Alphabet's chip partner Broadcom , while Google will also become Apple 's preferred cloud computing provider. Alphabet remains the dominant player in search. Because it owns both the market-leading browser (Chrome) and smartphone operating system (Android), and also has a revenue-sharing deal with Apple that makes Google the default search engine on its devices, Google has maintained its position as the de facto gateway to the internet for most people. At the same time, it has embedded Gemini throughout its solutions, including Google Search. Its AI Overviews and AI Mode options are contributing to an increase in search queries, which in turn is helping its search revenue growth accelerate. Story Continues Trading at a forward P/E of 26.5, Alphabet is another reasonably priced stock to buy and hold for the long haul. Image source: Getty Images. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is the leading chip manufacturer in the world, and as its competitors have struggled to achieve high enough yields of functional cutting-edge silicon, it has become a virtual monopoly when it comes to making advanced chips like GPUs and TPUs. The company's moat derives from both its technological expertise and its scale, which are unmatched in the industry. With the market for AI infrastructure booming, TSMC is working closely with chip designers to increase manufacturing capacity, and has greatly ramped up its own spending to build new fabs. At the same time, given its integral position in the semiconductor value chain, TSMC has been enjoying strong pricing power. In fact, according to reports, it has already informed customers of its planned schedule to raise prices over the next four years. Trading at a forward P/E of 25.5 times, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is another attractively valued growth stock to buy and hold. Between its growing production capacity and its ability to boost its prices, it has great long-term growth prospects. Should you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

Q4 2025 Earnings Call Summary - Moby Strategic Integration and Portfolio Optimization Management has doubled its annual run-rate synergy target to $1.5 billion over 30 months, citing significantly greater opportunities identified during the first 11 weeks of the IPG integration. The company is aggressively realigning its portfolio to focus on 'Connected Capabilities,' identifying $3.2 billion in annual revenue from non-strategic or underperforming operations for exit or sale. Performance attribution for the quarter was driven by strong results in Media and Experiential, while PR faced challenging year-over-year comparisons due to the prior year's U.S. national election cycle. Strategic positioning is now centered on a unified platform organization that integrates Acxiom's Real ID and Flywheel's Commerce Cloud into the next-generation Omni data solution. Operational improvements are being driven by a shift to a unified resourcing model, including accelerated outsourcing, offshoring, and the elimination of duplicative corporate functions. Management emphasizes a shift toward 'enterprise-level' partnerships, where Omnicom orchestrates the entire consumer journey from creative engagement to measurable commerce outcomes. 2026 Outlook and Synergy Framework The company expects to realize $900 million of the total $1.5 billion in synergies during 2026, primarily through labor cost reductions and real estate consolidation. Guidance for 2026 assumes a positive foreign exchange impact exceeding 2% and a stable effective tax rate of approximately 26%. Management plans to execute the remaining $1.7 billion of identified business exits and sales over the next 12 months to streamline the core portfolio. Capital allocation for 2026 includes a $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program, with an additional $500 million to $1 billion in repurchases planned for the remainder of the year. The 2026 financial framework anticipates a $210 million increase in net interest expense, driven by the assumption of IPG debt and refinancing costs for upcoming maturities. Non-Recurring Charges and Structural Risks Recorded $1.1 billion in severance and repositioning costs in Q4 related to the IPG acquisition and subsequent organizational restructuring. Recognized a $543 million loss on planned dispositions, reflecting the net realizable value of businesses identified for exit. The company is transitioning from majority to minority ownership in smaller markets representing $700 million in revenue to reduce compliance complexity while maintaining client service. Reported leverage ratios are currently distorted due to the inclusion of full IPG debt but only one month of IPG earnings; pro forma total leverage is estimated at 2.4x.

Organic growth expectations for the retained business in 2026 Management noted that excluding planned dispositions, Q4 organic growth would have been approximately 4%. Specific 2026 organic growth targets were deferred to the March 12 Investor Day, as the full interrogation of combined profit plans is still underway. Post-disposition, Media and related services (including Precision and Commerce) are expected to represent roughly mid-50% of total revenue. Client reception and competitive differentiation of the combined offering Management reported high enthusiasm from both employees and clients, particularly regarding the scale of resources available for AI and data investment. The integration of Acxiom's Real ID into the Omni platform is considered a key strategic advantage that has generated an overwhelming response from existing and potential clients ahead of its formal launch at the end of Q1. The company successfully closed the sale of IPG's Jack Morton business shortly after the quarter ended, demonstrating rapid execution of the disposal strategy. Impact of Generative AI on labor and client billing Management views AI as a tool to increase output and confidence levels (e.g., testing 50 creative concepts instead of 3) rather than just a headcount reduction mechanism. The company expects to evolve client negotiations toward performance-based goals and rewards as AI-driven efficiencies change traditional manual processes. Internal adoption is focused on 'agentic' capabilities that connect Omnicom's processes with client databases for faster, automated execution. One stock.

Substantially derisked the 5-year plan by reaching 76% of revenue completion targets for new leasing, exceeding the year-end goal of 70%. Successfully committed all 30 targeted anchor and big box replacements, which are expected to generate approximately $750 million in annual tenant sales and catalyze in-line leasing. Portfolio sales reached a company record high of $881 per square foot, with the Go-Forward portfolio performing even higher at $921 per square foot. Completed $1.3 billion of the $2 billion disposition target, focusing on simplifying the business and reducing leverage by a full turn. Management attributes performance to the strength of Class A retail centers and a 'bifurcated' consumer economy where luxury and high-quality branding continue to outperform. The acquisition of Crabtree Valley Mall serves as a blueprint for future value-add opportunities where the Macerich platform can drive rapid re-leasing and operational improvements. Outlook and Strategic Priorities for 2026-2028 Anticipates a growth inflection point in the second half of 2026, with the Signed-Not-Open (SNO) pipeline expected to contribute $30 million in 2026 and up to $50 million annually by 2028. Focusing 2026 efforts on completing the remaining 350 uncommitted new leases and managing rent commencement dates to ensure timely cash flow. Targets further leverage reduction to the low-to-mid 6x net debt to EBITDA range over the next couple of years through continued dispositions and organic growth. Plans to provide an updated Path-Forward 3.0 strategy in June 2026 and intends to resume formal earnings guidance starting in 2027. Future acquisition strategy will prioritize value-add, lease-up opportunities that are accretive to 2028 FFO targets, potentially utilizing capital partners or equity. Financial Adjustments and Risk Factors Reported a $16.1 million legal claim settlement income in Q4 2025 related to a former development project no longer being pursued. The 29th Street property loan ($76 million pro rata share) is currently in default following its maturity; management is in active discussions with the lender. Identified $200 million to $300 million in additional non-core assets for potential sale or give-back to lenders over the next year. Q4 FFO was partially offset by $8.4 million in corporate expenses due to annual incentive bonus payouts exceeding target levels. Story Continues Q&A Session Highlights Strategic rationale and funding for future acquisition opportunities Our analysts just identified a stock with the potential to be the next Nvidia. Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Management prefers value-add 'lease-up' deals like Crabtree over stabilized low-cap rate assets to ensure accretion to 2028 FFO targets. Funding preferences lead with equity issuance or capital partnerships, with property recycling as a secondary option. Timing and magnitude of the projected growth inflection Growth will be back-end weighted in 2026, with the most significant FFO contributions from the SNO pipeline arriving in 2027 and 2028. The Go-Forward portfolio is expected to achieve at least 3% NOI growth in 2026, trending toward a 5.2% CAGR through 2028. Impact of anchor replacements on mall traffic and leasing New concepts like DICK'S House of Sport are driving significant traffic increases (e.g., 18% of total mall traffic at Freehold) and stimulating demand for adjacent in-line spaces. Management noted that physical stores remain the most profitable channel for retailers, supporting high demand despite broader economic caution. Status of the $2 billion disposition program Remaining outparcel and land sales are weighted toward 2026 due to the time required for unencumbering assets from loan collateral and securing entitlements. Pricing for these assets remains stable, with recent sales occurring in the 7% to 8% cap rate range. One stock. Nvidia-level potential. 30M+ investors trust Moby to find it first. Get the pick.

      "content": "Teekay Tankers Ltd. Q4 2025 Earnings Call Summary Moby Intelligence Thu, February 19, 2026 at 8:30 AM EST 3 min read TNK Teekay Tankers Ltd. Q4 2025 Earnings Call Summary - Moby Strategic Performance and Market Dynamics Performance was driven by significant spot market exposure during a period where rates reached the second-highest fourth-quarter levels in 15 years. Management attributes market strength to the unwinding of OPEC+ supply cuts and rising production from the Americas, which increased seaborne oil trade volumes to near-record highs. Stricter sanctions on Russia, Iran, and Venezuela have created trading inefficiencies that benefit the compliant fleet by pushing volumes away from the 'dark fleet'. Operational outperformance was supported by 99.8% fleet availability and a strategic reduction in free cash flow breakeven levels to approximately $11,300 per day. The company is executing a 'drip-feed' fleet renewal strategy, selling older Suezmaxes and its only VLCC to capitalize on high asset values while acquiring more modern Aframaxes. Strategic positioning focuses on maintaining a debt-free balance sheet with $853 million in cash to allow for rapid opportunistic investments in a volatile environment. Outlook and Strategic Assumptions Global oil demand is projected to increase by 1.1 million barrels per day in 2026, with additional upside from Chinese strategic stockpiling estimated at 1 million barrels per day. The shift of Venezuelan oil to the compliant fleet is expected to create significant demand, with management noting that every 500,000 barrels per day shifted to the U.S. Gulf requires approximately 20 Aframaxes. While the tanker order book is at a 10-year high, management views this as essential replacement demand for a fleet that has reached its highest average age in over 30 years. Future fleet growth remains uncertain as it depends on the timing of vessel removals through scrapping or migration to the dark fleet versus new deliveries accelerating in 2027. Management assumes continued volatility and potential rate spikes driven by geopolitical security premiums, though the duration of such impacts depends on actual infrastructure disruption. Structural Changes and Risk Factors The company finalized the sale of its only VLCC for $84.5 million, marking a strategic exit from that specific asset class to focus on midsized tankers. Estimated gains of approximately $45 million from recent vessel sales are expected to be recognized across the first and second quarters of 2026. A U.S. naval blockade in Venezuela has effectively halted long-haul flows to China via the dark fleet, redirecting volumes to compliant tankers in the U.S. Gulf and Europe. The company successfully exited its investment in Ardmore, generating a gross return of over 14% as part of its capital allocation optimization. Story Continues Q&A Session Highlights Our analysts just identified a stock with the potential to be the next Nvidia. Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Capital allocation strategy and potential for large-scale M&A Management prefers a 'drip-feed' approach of buying 1-2 modern ships at a time rather than major M&A due to currently high relative asset values. The $853 million cash position is viewed as a 'high-class problem' that provides the flexibility to act quickly if market values dip or unique opportunities arise. Impact of Venezuelan and Canadian crude flow changes Venezuelan exports are shifting from long-haul dark fleet routes to China toward compliant midsized tankers serving the U.S. and Europe. The Trans Mountain Expansion (TMX) in Canada is expected to drive Aframax demand as barrels move directly to Asia, potentially replacing lost Venezuelan heavy sour crude. Special dividend expectations for the first quarter Management deflected specific timing or amounts for a special dividend, noting that such decisions are typically discussed at the March Board meeting. Historical patterns suggest any announcements regarding supplemental capital returns would coincide with the May earnings release. One stock.

Q4 2025 Earnings Call Summary - Moby Strategic Performance and Operational Context Performance was impacted by accelerated depreciation from reverting the Wynnewood renewable diesel unit to hydrocarbon processing and extended downtime at the Coffeyville fertilizer plant. Management is initiating a cultural shift toward commercial optimization to improve margin capture by responding faster to volatile market windows and feedstock opportunities. The reversion of the Wynnewood unit is expected to expand crude slate flexibility and allow for the repurposing of rail assets for better feedstock security. At Coffeyville, the company is aggressively ramping up WCS processing toward 20,000 barrels per day to capitalize on widening Canadian crude differentials. The Fertilizer segment faced a 3-week startup delay caused by a third-party air separation plant, though underlying nitrogen demand remains robust due to high corn acreage estimates. Management is adopting a more proactive stance toward M&A, seeking geographic diversity and scale through bilateral discussions rather than traditional auction processes. Outlook and Strategic Priorities Refining fundamentals are expected to remain constructive through 2027 as global capacity additions slow while refined product demand, particularly diesel, remains steady. New refined product pipelines under development are expected to reduce seasonal basis volatility in the Mid-Continent by providing outlets to the West Coast and Denver. The company aims to restore a 'sustainable' dividend that can be maintained through all market cycles, rather than a fluctuating payout. Growth capital spending for 2026 is projected at $75 million to $90 million, peaking due to the Wynnewood alkylation project and fertilizer debottlenecking. Management anticipates Wynnewood will continue to receive Small Refinery Exemptions (SREs) for the 2017-2024 period despite ongoing regulatory uncertainty. Risk Factors and Structural Changes The RFS obligation at Wynnewood is currently 2 to 3 times the total personnel costs of the facility, representing a significant structural headwind. A $1 billion senior notes offering was completed post-quarter end to extend the debt maturity profile and redeem higher-interest 2029 notes. The loss of the blenders tax credit and declining HOBO spreads drove the Renewable segment to a breakeven adjusted EBITDA before its conversion. Management explicitly flagged 'disproportionate economic harm' from RFS compliance and vowed to continue legal and regulatory challenges against the EPA. Q&A Session Highlights Our analysts just identified a stock with the potential to be the next Nvidia. Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Story Continues Strategic approach and criteria for proactive M&A expansion Management intends to engage in bilateral discussions to identify opportunities outside of competitive auctions for both refining and fertilizer assets. Strict discipline will be maintained: deals must be accretive to shareholders and must not 'stretch the balance sheet' or require excessive leverage. Sequencing of debt repayment versus dividend restoration The company does not believe it must reach its $1 billion gross leverage target before reinstating a dividend, but it requires a 'clear path' to further deleveraging. The primary goal is a dividend level that is sustainable in both 'good crack markets and bad' to avoid a 'yo-yo' effect. Impact of rising RIN prices and mitigation strategies Management attributed the rise in RIN prices to a proposed higher RVO (Renewable Volume Obligation) that has not yet been finalized. Strategies to minimize exposure include increasing internal blending capacity and potentially acquiring retail or additional blending assets through M&A. One stock.

What happened According to a February 4, 2026, SEC filing , Valley Wealth Managers, Inc. sold 479,832 shares of Sonoco Products Company, with the transaction’s estimated value at $19.9 million based on the mean closing price for the quarter. The value of the fund’s position declined by $20.7 million quarter over quarter, reflecting both the share sale and price fluctuations during the period.

The company’s scale and integrated approach enable it to serve both industrial and consumer markets with tailored, value-added packaging products. Sonoco’s broad geographic reach and focus on innovation support its competitive position in the packaging industry. What this transaction means for investors Sonoco Products is a relatively slow-growing business. While its revenue surged 42% in 2025, it has a history of low top-line growth. Valley Wealth Managers sold the stock in the quarter, while adding to other top positions in the Vanguard Russell 1000 Growth ETF and Apple . Story Continues Valley Wealth also reduced stakes in other top positions, such as AI chipmaker Broadcom and Alphabet . These tech stocks have had major runs over the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.

What Happened According to a SEC filing dated February 13, 2026, Shannon River Fund Management LLC sold 125,230 shares of InterDigital during the fourth quarter. The estimated transaction value is $44.28 million, based on the average closing price for the quarter. The fund’s position in InterDigital dropped from 9.9% of assets under management to 2.67%, with a period-end value of $17.03 million. The net change in position value for the quarter was $44.67 million. What Else to Know This was a significant reduction, with InterDigital now representing 2.67% of the fund’s 13F assets under management.

InterDigital, Inc. specializes in developing and licensing advanced wireless and video technologies, with a strong focus on 2G through 5G networks, IoT, and multimedia applications. Its extensive patent portfolio underpins its licensing-driven business model, providing critical intellectual property to a wide range of technology manufacturers worldwide. The company's scale and deep R&D capabilities position it as a key enabler of next-generation connectivity and digital innovation. What This Transaction Means for Investors Shannon River, a New York-based hedge fund, recently sold roughly $44 million worth of InterDigital (IDCC) stock during the fourth quarter (the three months ending on Dec. 31, 2025). That reduced its position in the technology stock by about 75%. Here’s what it means for investors. Story Continues First off, we should recognize that IDCC stock has been on quite the run. Over the last three years, shares have advanced by 397%, equating to an exceptional compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 69.4%. Therefore, it’s possible, and perhaps likely, that Shannon River is simply taking profits in a stock that has delivered astonishing returns. Looking ahead, there are a few things investors should know about IDCC stock. In the plus column, the company is riding high. Revenue and net income are both near record-high levels. IDCC has secured several key legal victories ensuring the ability to monetize its patent portfolio. What’s more, management has provided upbeat revenue and earnings guidance for 2026. On other hand, the stock’s long run of success could prove a new challenge. In particular, the stock’s valuation is now gaining increased scrutiny. IDCC’s price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple now stands at 30x. That’s near its highest level in three years and nearly double its three-year average PE multiple of 17x. In summary, Shannon River’s sale of IDCC is likely prudent portfolio management. After all, on balance, IDCC’s overall business fundamentals look solid given its near-record revenue and its bullish guidance. However, valuation concerns could temper demand for IDCC stock at its current level. Should you buy stock in InterDigital right now?

Q4 2025 Earnings Call Summary - Moby Strategic Performance Drivers Achieved 9% rebased adjusted OIBDA growth in 2025, driven by aggressive cost initiatives and a 2 percentage point reduction in P&E additions as a percentage of revenue. Performance was bolstered by the migration of over 225,000 mobile postpaid subscribers, particularly in Costa Rica and Puerto Rico, enhancing revenue predictability. Puerto Rico reached a critical turning point with its first positive postpaid net adds since the network migration, supported by the launch of the 'Liberty Mix' multiline plan. B2B segment strength, representing nearly one-third of group revenue, was driven by high-speed internet wins in Panama and expanding IT-as-a-Service solutions. Management attributed the 27% increase in adjusted OIBDA less P&E additions to a disciplined capital allocation strategy and improved operational efficiency across credit silos. The group successfully navigated significant headwinds from Hurricane Melissa, which impacted fixed infrastructure in Jamaica but demonstrated the resilience of the mobile network. 2026 Outlook and Strategic Priorities Management targets a return to pre-hurricane profitability levels in Jamaica by the end of 2026, utilizing $81 million in net weather derivative proceeds for reconstruction. Financial performance in 2026 is expected to be heavily weighted toward the second half of the year due to the timing of the Jamaican recovery and project spending. The company anticipates a $100 million adjusted free cash flow impact from Hurricane Melissa in 2026, with a full recovery projected for 2027. Strategic focus remains on Fixed-Mobile Convergence (FMC) to increase household ARPU and reduce churn, alongside the deployment of 5G standalone in partnership with Ericsson. Liberty Networks is positioned for long-term recurring revenue growth through the El Salvador subsea cable project and the MANTA joint build, expected to be operational by late 2027. Structural Changes and Risk Factors The company is actively working on the structural separation of Liberty Puerto Rico from the broader LLA group to unlock shareholder value. Liberty Puerto Rico is undergoing a liability management exercise to address high leverage (14x covenant leverage) and may require additional liquidity for operating costs. Fixed network assets in Jamaica were reduced by 133,000 homes passed where service restoration is not foreseen in the near term following hurricane damage. The rejection of the Tigo merger in Costa Rica has shifted management's focus toward organic cost reduction and margin expansion within that specific market.

AI implementation and partnership strategy with AWS versus Google Management clarified that the AWS partnership is a deep integration for internal compute and customer cloud migration, rather than just a reseller agreement. AI is currently being deployed in call centers (e.g., Costa Rica) to automate repetitive processes, with the goal of translating these efficiencies into tangible free cash flow expansion. Sustainability of Fixed-Mobile Convergence (FMC) and revenue growth The 'golden product' is linking postpaid mobile with fixed broadband, which management noted increases ARPU and significantly lowers churn across all markets.

Q4 2025 Earnings Call Summary - Moby Strategic Performance Drivers Delivered a third consecutive year of operating ROE improvement to 16.2%, outperforming the long-term target of 12% to 15% through disciplined risk selection. Achieved 1.5 points of year-over-year improvement in core underwriting earnings quality, supported by an eighth consecutive quarter of attritional loss ratio improvement. Shifted portfolio mix toward less volatile lines, with 60% of growth coming from sectors less correlated to P&C pricing cycles, notably Accident & Health. Crystallized $390 million in liquidity and nearly $200 million in off-balance sheet value through the strategic sales of Armada and Arcadian MGAs. Maintained a lower volatility profile by prioritizing insurance growth over reinsurance, while utilizing reinsurance as a flexible tool for MGA partnerships. Applied a highly selective distribution strategy, rejecting over 90% of MGA opportunities to ensure alignment on underwriting excellence and data sharing. Strengthened the leadership team by welcoming 18 senior leaders and promoting 6 from within, reflecting improved talent attraction and employee engagement. 2026 Outlook and Strategic Initiatives Anticipates tougher market conditions in 2026, particularly in property catastrophe, but expects to maintain performance levels through a diversified, niche-focused portfolio. Projects the IMG business to generate over $30 million in fee income and $35 million in EBITDA in 2026, bolstered by the acquisitions of Assist America and World Nomads. Models a go-forward effective tax rate of approximately 19% and an OUE expense ratio maintained between 6.5% and 7%. Intends to repurchase $100 million of common shares over the next 12 months, expected to be accretive to EPS and ROE throughout 2026. Implemented a new property aggregate program for 2026 that attaches at $90 million of losses to protect against the frequency of small-to-medium catastrophe events. Capital Management and Risk Factors Redeeming $200 million of 8% preference shares in February 2026 to reduce the leverage ratio to a historic low of 23%. Identified pricing challenges in public D&O and commercial auto, leading to a substantial reduction in premium and exposure in those lines. Noted that the current book value likely understates the company's true value due to the conservative valuation of the 100% owned IMG MGA. Maintained significant remaining limits on three loss portfolio transfers (2021, 2023, 2024), providing a robust buffer for legacy liabilities.

Story Continues Sustainability of underwriting margins amid 2026 market headwinds Management believes the 91.7% insurance combined ratio is a sustainable run rate, with potential 0.5 point fluctuations based on business mix. Strategic insulation is expected from niche MGA partnerships and lines like Accident & Health and Surety that do not follow general P&C rate cycles. Fee income trajectory following the Armada sale Excluding Armada, the fee income run rate is approximately $30 million, with a target of $40 million plus EBITDA once new acquisitions are fully integrated. World Nomads integration is expected to contribute materially starting in 2027, including channeling underwriting business to the A&H division. Growth sustainability in the Surety business line Management dismissed concerns regarding data center or government infrastructure booms as 'red herrings' for their specific book. The company views its Surety portfolio as being in the 'early innings' of build-out, with significant tailwinds expected for 2026. One stock.

Q4 2025 Earnings Call Summary - Moby Strategic Execution and Portfolio Optimization Performance in Q4 2025 was driven by sequential margin expansion resulting from higher acuity, improved payer mix, and sustained cost controls. Management attributed growth in specific markets to targeted capital investments, such as ER expansions in Knoxville and a $10 million women's services investment in Birmingham. The company successfully reduced leverage from 7.4x to 6.6x year-over-year through a combination of operational improvements and the application of divestiture proceeds to debt reduction. Strategic focus has shifted toward 'networks of care,' where smaller rural hospitals serve as essential access points for higher-acuity services within larger metropolitan hubs. Operational efficiency was bolstered by the full-year implementation of a unified Oracle ERP system, which standardized data and provided approximately $50 million in cost savings. Management acknowledged temporary disruptions in 2025 caused by economic impacts on patient behavior and regulatory uncertainty regarding reimbursement and insurance coverage. 2026 Outlook and Strategic Priorities 2026 guidance assumes a 'jump-off point' EBITDA of $1.36 billion after adjusting for divestitures and one-time items, reflecting roughly 4% growth in core operations. Management expects a $20 million to $30 million EBITDA headwind from potential Health Insurance Marketplace (HICS) enrollment reductions due to subsidy expirations and administrative reforms. Financial projections assume a 4% increase in Medicare inpatient rates for 2026, the highest such increase in recent management memory. Medical specialist fees are projected to face upward pressure of 5% to 8% in 2026, primarily driven by anesthesia and radiology costs. The company anticipates a $140 million headwind to 2026 cash flows from operations due to an extra biweekly pay period (27 pay dates versus the standard 26). Capital Structure and Risk Factors Net debt is projected to decrease to approximately $9.2 billion following the completion of the Huntsville divestiture, down from $10.1 billion at year-end 2025 and $11.4 billion at year-end 2024. The divestiture of three Pennsylvania hospitals, while representing $0.5 billion in annual revenue, was described as essentially EBITDA breakeven. Management noted that 'programmatic divestitures' are nearing completion, with future transactions likely to be opportunistic rather than structural. 2025 results included $45 million in non-recurring EBITDA benefits from Tennessee State Directed Payments and opioid settlements that will not repeat in 2026. Story Continues Q&A Session Highlights Our analysts just identified a stock with the potential to be the next Nvidia. Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Future divestiture strategy and portfolio pruning limits Management stated they are nearing the end of their programmatic divestiture phase but remain open to opportunistic deals that allow for material deleveraging. The current portfolio is viewed as a stable core, with interest in selling assets 'dwindling' as the focus shifts to internal growth. Impact of HICS enrollment declines on margins Management clarified that HICS represents less than 5% of revenue and that the EBITDA impact is mitigated by low historical collection rates on co-pays from this population. A hypothetical 20% volume reduction in HICS is modeled as a $100 million to $120 million revenue loss but only a $20 million to $30 million EBITDA hit. AI implementation and technology-driven cost savings The company is deploying AI for autonomous coding, virtual patient sitters to prevent falls, and ambient listening for clinical documentation. Management expects the maturing ERP system to provide further runway for savings beyond the $50 million captured in 2025 through better supply chain visibility and system consolidation. One stock.

(Photo by Ludovic MARIN / AFP) | Image Credits:Ludovic MARIN/AFP / Getty Images What would have been a moment of united commitment to global tech innovation at the ongoing India AI Impact Summit instead proved an awkward one: When Prime Minister Narendra Modi prompted speakers at the event to join hands and raise them in a show of solidarity, all executives onstage obliged — except OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Anthropic’s Dario Amodei, who held their hands noticeably apart. More from Yahoo Scout What happened at the India AI Impact Summit? Why did the CEOs refuse to hold hands? How are OpenAI and Anthropic expanding in India? What caused tension between OpenAI and Anthropic CEOs? As leaders of the two foremost labs in the AI race, it goes without saying that Altman and Amodei are fierce competitors. That rivalry has only intensified in recent months: After OpenAI said it would bring advertisements to ChatGPT, Anthropic took a swipe at OpenAI in a couple ads during the Super Bowl, declaring that it would never introduce ads into Claude. Altman soon after hit back in response , calling Anthropic “dishonest” and “authoritarian.” “We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid, and we know our users would reject that,” he wrote at the time. Both Altman and Amodei were in India this week for the AI summit held in New Delhi, which saw a bevy of AI-related investments, features, and products being announced. OpenAI said it is opening two new offices in India, partnering with IT giant TCS , and deploying tools for higher education . Anthropic has also opened an office in India and teamed up with Infosys for internal and external deployment of its AI tools . Terms and Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices More Info",

Q4 2025 Earnings Call Summary - Moby Strategic Performance and Operational Drivers Achieved record organic growth with 72,000 room openings, a 13% increase over the previous year, driven by strong conversion activity and new construction prototypes. Global development pipeline expanded to 260,000 rooms, featuring a 30% domestic fee-par premium compared to the existing system, which management expects to enhance future margins. Domestic RevPAR declined 4% for the full year, primarily attributed to softness in Texas, California, and Florida, which represent one-quarter of the U.S. room count. International growth was led by a 14% direct franchising increase in China and 9% overall international net room growth, despite deflationary pressures in the Chinese economy. Ancillary fee streams grew 15% for the full year, fueled by strategic partnerships, a record 54% domestic direct loyalty occupancy, and momentum in co-branded credit card programs. Management noted that excluding hurricane impacts, U.S. RevPAR declined 6% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by continued softness in the company's three largest states—Texas, California, and Florida—which saw an 11% decline. Operational efficiencies were realized through the deployment of over 350 AI agents, which management claims reduced on-property labor costs while driving direct booking capture. 2026 Outlook and Strategic Assumptions Full-year 2026 net room growth is projected between 4% and 4.5%, excluding potential impacts from the Revo Hospitality Group insolvency proceedings. Global RevPAR guidance ranges from up 0.5% to down 1.5%, assuming U.S. RevPAR remains approximately flat from the second through fourth quarters. Management anticipates a first-quarter headwind due to the termination of 3,000 legacy rooms, primarily sourced from Travel + Leisure and Vacasa managed properties. The 2026 financial outlook conservatively excludes all revenue recognition from the Revo franchisee until collectibility is certain, representing a $12 million royalty headwind. Capital allocation plans include deploying approximately $110 million in development advances to continue securing high-fee-par rooms in accretive markets. Non-Recurring Items and Risk Factors Recorded $160 million in non-cash charges related to the insolvency of European franchisee Revo Hospitality Group, impacting loan values and intangible assets. Management characterized the Revo insolvency as a unique outlier due to its high concentration, noting that no other franchisee holds more than 5% of outstanding development advances. A 5% increase in the quarterly cash dividend was authorized for 2026, reflecting management's confidence in the business model's 60% free cash flow conversion rate. Identified potential macro tailwinds for late 2026, including infrastructure spend, the FIFA World Cup, and potential government stimulus ahead of midterm elections.

Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Management reported that January U.S. RevPAR improved to down 4% and February trends are continuing to strengthen as comps become easier. Occupancy recovery is most pronounced in the economy and midscale segments compared to 2019 levels, though ADR still lags inflation by 1,500 basis points. Impact and recovery strategy regarding the Revo insolvency Management clarified that while the hotels remain in the system, all related revenue is being deferred until legal proceedings conclude, which could take many months. The company emphasized that total loan exposure to other franchisees is limited to approximately $20 million, mitigating broader systemic risk. Monetization and efficiency gains from AI initiatives AI agents are driving over 300 basis points of incremental direct contribution for participating franchisees by handling guest calls and upselling amenities. Management is establishing direct API connections with major LLMs like Claude and ChatGPT to ensure data accuracy and bypass web scraping. Infrastructure demand trends and government business impact Infrastructure-related demand was a slight drag in 2025 due to federal government shutdowns, but contracted room nights are currently pacing at twice the consumed levels.

Buy Button by Formatoriginal via Shutterstock Wajeeh Khan Thu, February 19, 2026 at 6:52 AM PST 2 min read RXT PLTR Rackspace Technology (RXT) shares more than tripled on Wednesday after the Nasdaq-listed firm announced a new strategic partnership with Palantir Technologies (PLTR). This massive surge of retail interest pushed RXT’s relative strength index (14-day) into the late 70s, indicating extremely overbought conditions that often precede a sharp correction. Despite its meteoric run, however, Rackspace stock remains down more than 50% versus its 52-week high. More News from Barchart Has Palantir Bottomed? Probably, Based on Huge, Unusual Put Options Activity in PLTR SoftBank Just Sold $3.6 Billion Worth of Nvidia Stock. Should You Ditch NVDA Too? Rackspace Stock Is Soaring on a Palantir Partnership. Should You Chase RXT Shares Here? Tired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now! www.barchart.com Does Palantir Deal Still Warrant Buying RXT Shares? While the aforementioned technical setup suggests RXT stock could pull back in the near-term, it’s still reasonable to consider investing in it at current levels. Why? Because the PLTR agreement positions Rackspace as a critical implementation and managed services provider for enterprises seeking to deploy its Foundry and Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). It effectively addresses a significant market gap where organizations struggle to extract meaningful value from AI platforms due to limited in-house expertise in deploying and operating systems at scale. Over time, this strategic partnership could help Rackspace Technology improve its revenue growth and stabilize margins. Where Options Data Suggests Rackspace Stock Is Headed While RXT remains a penny stock, which often means higher risk, those following technical indicators should note that it now sits decisively above its key moving averages (MAs). This suggests that upward momentum could sustain in the near term as bulls have firmly taken control across multiple timeframes. Additionally, derivatives data for Rackspace shares remains largely skewed to the upside. Options contracts expiring mid-May have the upper price set at $2.27 currently, indicating potential upside of another 60% from here. It's also worth mentioning that RXT at just 0.12x sales is still an inexpensive name to own, especially given its commitment to transforming into a critical enabler of high-value AI workloads. How Wall Street Recommends Playing Rackspace Technology According to Barchart, some Wall Street firms also believe that Rackspace Technology could push higher still through the remainder of 2026. Story Continues While the consensus rating on RXT shares remains at a “Hold,\" price targets on this Texas-based company go as high as $1.75, signaling potential for a nearly 30% rally from current levels. www.barchart.com This article was created with the support of automated content tools from our partners at Sigma.AI.

Our costs were above annual guidance reflecting the same factors. Despite the setbacks, we delivered a number of financial records, including revenue of $1,800,000,000, record free cash flow of over $350,000,000 while funding our high-return growth projects. Supported by strong free cash flow generation, we doubled our shareholder returns, further strengthened our balance sheet by reducing our debt, and eliminated more of the hedges inherited from the Argonaut Gold transaction, giving us increased exposure to higher gold price. Looking ahead to 2026, we expect a meaningful improvement in operational performance to drive a 12% increase in production. This will be driven by the ramp-up of mining rates at Island Gold as part of the Phase 3 Plus expansion, as well as higher mining rates at Young-Davidson. We expect further growth in production at lower costs in the coming years as we deliver on the larger Island Gold District expansion by 2028 and bring Lynn Lake into production by 2029. Our longer-term outlook remains firmly on track to nearly double our annual production to approximately over 1,000,000 ounces a year at lower costs. Now turning to Slide 4, over the past month, we outlined the key drivers of our strong outlook. As detailed in our updated three-year guidance, we expect to deliver a 46% increase in production at approximately 20% lower all-in sustaining costs by 2028. We also provided exploration updates on our mines and exploration projects, highlighting significant upside potential across our portfolio. Our successful exploration program in 2025 contributed to a 32% increase in year-end mineral reserves to 16,000,000 ounces, marking the seventh consecutive year of growth. This included a near doubling of reserves at Island Gold District to over 8,000,000 ounces. As announced earlier this month, this growth is being incorporated into a larger expansion of the district, which is expected to create one of the largest, longest-life, and most profitable gold operations in Canada. This is a high-return expansion that the Island Gold District can fund on its own, contributing to our increasing free cash flow. Reflecting this strong outlook and growing free cash flow, we were pleased to announce a 60% increase in our dividend commencing this quarter. As outlined in the expansion study, we will be expanding milling rates to 20,000 tonnes per day. The higher rate is supported by increased mining rates per day from the open pit, 3,000 tonnes per day from underground, and 17,000 tonnes. Story Continues With the completion of the expansion in 2028, annual production from the Island Gold District is expected to average 534,000 ounces of gold for the initial ten years at lower mine site all-in sustaining costs of $1,025 per ounce. This is more than double the 2025 production and at 30% lower costs. At a conservative $3,200 per ounce gold price, the operation will generate in excess of $800,000,000 of annual free cash flow and have an after-tax net present value of $8,200,000,000, and at a gold price of $4,500 per ounce, the after-tax NPV increases to $12,000,000,000, making the Island Gold District one of the largest and most valuable gold operations in Canada. Now turning to Slide 6. Our three-year guidance outlined a clear path to reach 800,000 ounces of gold production by 2028 at nearly 20% lower all-in sustaining costs of approximately $1,250 per ounce. Longer term, the completion of the Island Gold District expansion in 2028 and initial production from Lynn Lake in 2029 is expected to drive our production to approximately 1,000,000 ounces per year by the end of the decade, with a further decrease in costs. We have one of the best growth profiles in the sector, and we can fund all our growth internally while we continue to generate increasing free cash flow. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Greg Fisher, who will review our financial performance. Greg? Greg Fisher: Thank you, John. Moving to Slide 7, we sold 142,000 ounces of gold in the fourth quarter at an average realized price of $3,998 per ounce for record quarterly revenues of $575,000,000. For the full year, we sold 531,000 ounces at a realized price of $3,372 per ounce for record annual revenues of $1,800,000,000, up 34% from 2024. Our full-year total cash cost of $1,077 per ounce and all-in sustaining cost of $1,524 per ounce were above annual guidance, driven by higher costs in the fourth quarter and the temporary challenges at our Canadian operations. Operating cash flow before changes in non-cash working capital was $285,000,000 in the fourth quarter, or $0.68 per share. This was reduced by $63,000,000, or $0.15 per share, reflecting the cash utilized to eliminate the legacy Argonaut Gold hedges prior to maturity. For the full year, operating cash flow before changes in non-cash working capital increased 27% to a record $924,000,000 or $2.20 per share. Our reported net earnings were $435,000,000 in the fourth quarter, or $1.03 per share. This included a $227,000,000 after-tax gain on the sale of non-core assets, a loss on commodity hedge derivatives of $35,000,000, and other adjustments of $16,000,000. Excluding these items, our adjusted net earnings were $228,000,000 or $0.54 per share. Our full-year adjusted net earnings were $587,000,000 or $1.40 per share. Capital spending in the quarter totaled $158,000,000 and included $50,000,000 of sustaining capital, $97,000,000 of growth capital, and $11,000,000 of capitalized exploration. For the full year, total capital expenditures were $507,000,000, including growth capital of $318,000,000. We continue to fund our high-return growth internally while generating strong free cash flow, including a record $157,000,000 of free cash flow generated in the fourth quarter and a record $352,000,000 for the full year. Reflecting our growing free cash flow and strong financial position, we returned $81,000,000 to shareholders in 2025, double the amount returned in 2024. This includes the repurchase of 1,300,000 shares at a cost of $39,000,000 and dividend payments totaling $42,000,000. With additional free cash flow growth ahead, we expect further increases in our shareholder returns, starting with a 60% increase in our dividend this quarter. We also paid down $50,000,000 of debt and eliminated half the 2026 legacy hedges inherited from Argonaut Gold. To date, we have now repurchased and eliminated 230,000 out of the 330,000 ounces hedged by Argonaut prior to maturity, providing increased exposure to the rising gold price. We will continue to look for opportunities to eliminate the remaining 100,000 ounces subject to hedges across 2026 and 2027. Given our strong free cash flow, our cash position grew 90% from 2024 to $623,000,000 while reducing our debt to $200,000,000. We expect growing production and declining costs to drive increasing free cash flow over the next several years while we continue to fund our organic growth plans. With that, I will turn the call over to our COO, Luc Guimond, to provide an overview of our operations. Luc? Luc Guimond: Thank you, Greg. Over to Slide 8. Fourth quarter production from the Island Gold District totaled 60,000 ounces, a 10% decline over the previous quarter due to lower underground mining rates as well as reduced mill throughput.

It prompted an audible, “Oh, wow!” and I knew I had to tell you about it. Because while these types of moments do not always turn into major market moves, sometimes they do. And as I always say, long-term trend changes start with short-term price action. More News from Barchart Has Palantir Bottomed? Probably, Based on Huge, Unusual Put Options Activity in PLTR SoftBank Just Sold $3.6 Billion Worth of Nvidia Stock. Should You Ditch NVDA Too? Rackspace Stock Is Soaring on a Palantir Partnership. Should You Chase RXT Shares Here? Tired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now! At issue is the Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ). This ETF is big and powerful, the closest thing the ETF world has to omnipotent. The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) gets the biggest “pub” from investors, but QQQ is where the consistently magnificent returns have come from. So it matters when any type of potential crack makes itself evident. I see one now. Below is QQQ’s daily chart. It is weeping like a tree — the kind that weep, anyway. The 20-day moving average (in red) is about three weeks into a downtrend, and the 50-day has joined it in the loss column. The 200-day EMA is flat, and that in itself is remarkable. That hasn’t happened much the past two years, as you can see below. It has been a series of long positive moves, interrupted by occasional short bursts to the downside. What makes QQQ the “king” of this market is its resilience. Small caps? Forget about ‘em! Dow Industrials (DIA)? Old fashioned — not to me, but to many traders and media personalities, too. International stocks? Maybe next century. But QQQ? Ah, the once and future leader of all things stock market. But suddenly, it is showing its human side, so to speak. QQQ’s Chart Looks Ominous From This Angle www.barchart.com Those moving averages are slipping, but so is the PPO, my all-time favorite momentum indicator. It just dipped under the zero line, which is a big deal to me. Does this mean QQQ crashes soon? That’s an impossible question. And more to the point, it is irrelevant. If you learn how to hedge — with collars, other option strategies, inverse ETFs, position sizing, etc. — you can invest in anything. This is less about timing, and more about a gathering docket of evidence. QQQ is bent, not broken. But you don’t get a serious market reversal (downward) without some bending action first. This is not a new situation. It has been rolling over subtly for weeks. But what made me utter something I can’t write here was this hourly chart below. That’s a three-week downtrend, which again reversed at exactly where it should ($610 area) on Wednesday afternoon. I’ll point out that what turned a nice positive day for QQQ into a 1% intra-day dip in about 150 minutes, started a full hour before the Fed’s latest minutes came out. Story Continues www.barchart.com This is micro-analysis, as I see it. But the goal in charting multiple time frames is that the evidence starts to pile on itself. That’s what I’m watching carefully in the days and weeks to come. OK, What Else You Got? We technicians like to talk about “confirmation.” That’s when multiple indicators and signals corroborate each other’s conclusions. As regular readers of mine know, I created my own confirmation indicator, that I trained to read the chart for me, as a productivity tool and portfolio-building factor. That’s the ROAR score. And while I had one “out loud” moment in viewing the short-term QQQ chart I showed you above, I had another one when I was reviewing ROAR scores and saw this. Chart courtesy of Rob Isbitts via ROAR.PiTrade.com. QQQ has been knocked down to a score of 20. Loosely translated, that means it has about a 4:1 change of substantial decline going forward, versus a strong rally. I’m not talking about the next few points in either direction. That’s noise. I’m talking about breaking the months-long pattern that has QQQ trading where it did more than four months ago. In this market, for buy-the-dips-trained investors, that’s a lifetime. The other thing I track constantly in my trading is a different type of sync up activity. With upcoming market news and events. And last I checked, Nvidia’s (NVDA) earnings are next week. And that’s hardly the only macro news on tap between now and February-end. And yes, you read that right. NVDA is macro news now. QQQ’s direction will lean heavily on it, along with the other handful of stocks that crowd the top of the Nasdaq 100 Index. Time to pay close attention.

Applying fertelizer by Etienne Girardet via Unsplash Pathikrit Bose Thu, February 19, 2026 at 10:08 AM CST 6 min read SFM AMD AMZN META TSLA Hedge fund manager Philippe Laffont is known for making outsized and successful bets on disruptive technology companies. Through his fund Coatue Management, the 58-year-old not only made lucrative bets on public companies like Tesla (TSLA) and AMD (AMD), but he was also one of the early investors in TikTok-parent ByteDance, Spotify (SPOT), and Instacart (CART). A recent 13F filing shedding light on his latest set of transactions revealed some interesting moves by Laffont, wherein he substantially increased his holdings of streaming and e-commerce giants Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN), respectively, while trimming his stake in Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) and Meta (META). However, one company, far removed from the tech space, grabbed attention. Curiously, Laffont initiated a position in Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM). More News from Barchart Has Palantir Bottomed?

About Sprouts Farmers Market Founded in 2002, Sprouts Farmers Market is one of the largest specialty health-food retailers in the U.S. Sprouts operates as a \"healthy grocery store\" with an open-air farmers market layout. Unlike traditional grocers, fresh produce is located at the center of the store rather than the perimeter. They focus on natural, organic, and \"attribute-driven\" products. As of early 2026, the company operates over 450 stores across roughly 24 states and continues to expand its footprint across the U.S. with new store openings in markets such as Houston’s Kingwood suburb and the Bay Area in California, reflecting geographic expansion and strategic market penetration. Valued at a market cap of $6.6 billion, the SFM stock is down 14% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis. Notably, Laffont bought about 601,886 shares of the company, whose stock reached an all-time high in 2025. What led to this rise, and how come it was able to convince a tech native like Laffont to buy its shares? Let's find out. www.barchart.com Solid Financials Served Fresh Sprouts has displayed steady growth rates. Over the past 10 years, its revenues and earnings have clocked CAGRs of 9.80% and 15.79%, respectively. It may not be spectacular, but the company has grown sustainably, as evidenced by the manageable amount of debt on its books. Story Continues Moreover, the latest quarter saw the company reporting a beat on earnings, the ninth straight instance of doing so. While net sales climbed by 13% from the previous year to $2.2 billion, accompanied by a comparable sales growth rate of 5.9%, earnings went up by 34.1% in the same period to $1.22 per share. Notably, the EPS of $1.22 came in ahead of the consensus estimate of $1.18. The company opened nine new stores in Q3 2025 while increasing its net cash from operating activities to $577.5 million for the nine months ended Sept. 28, 2025, from $520.4 million in the year-ago period. Overall, the company closed the quarter with a cash balance of $322.42 million, higher than its short-term debt levels of $172.21 million. For the fourth quarter, the company expects its EPS to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.90, the midpoint of which would denote a year-over-year (YoY) growth rate of 11.4%. The company is set to report its Q4 results today post-market. Currently, SFM stock is also trading at undervalued levels, with its forward P/E, P/S, and P/CF of 12.82, 0.75, and 8.40, lower than the sector medians of 16.68, 1.08, and 11.93, respectively. Cultivating Growth With Strong Operations The financials may look attractive for SFM; however, what may have made the deal for Laffont is the company's way of functioning and its fresh offerings, which make it easy for consumers to trust the brand and drive sales. At the core of Sprouts' proposition lies its \"Attribute-Driven\" merchandising. Unlike conventional stores that stock a broad array of mass-market goods, Sprouts curates approximately 70% of its inventory around specific consumer trends such as keto, plant-based, and non-GMO products. This creates a \"treasure hunt\" experience that drives high customer engagement. Also, the company’s \"Sprouts Brand\" private label has grown to represent over 25% of total sales, providing a dual benefit of higher profit margins and increased brand loyalty. In 2024 alone, the company introduced over 7,100 new products, utilizing its \"Innovation Centers\" to test and scale emerging brands faster than its competitors. The next aspect is right up Laffont's alley and must have certainly played its part in him buying Sprouts shares. To maintain its edge, Sprouts has aggressively integrated AI into its backend operations. The company utilizes machine learning algorithms to optimize inventory management, particularly for its high-turnover perishable items, which account for nearly 60% of its revenue. By predicting demand with higher precision, Sprouts has successfully reduced product waste, contributing to a 60 bps increase in gross margins in late 2025. Additionally, the full rollout of the Sprouts Rewards loyalty program in 2025 has allowed the company to deploy AI-driven personalized marketing, tailoring promotions to individual shopping habits and increasing the average \"basket size\" per visit. The company is currently executing a disciplined \"smaller-format\" expansion plan. Moving away from massive 30,000+ square foot footprints, Sprouts is now opening stores at approximately 23,000 square feet. This model requires less capital to build, allows for faster site selection in dense urban markets, and reaches profitability more quickly. As of early 2026, the company has a pipeline of over 140 approved locations and intends to grow its store count by 10% annually through 2027. However, despite its strengths, shareholders must remain mindful of significant headwinds. The most immediate concern is the securities litigation filed in late 2025, which alleges the company provided misleading growth projections during a period of consumer softening. Furthermore, as traditional retailers like Amazon (AMZN)-owned Whole Foods and Walmart (WMT) expand their organic offerings, price competition in the \"natural\" space is intensifying. There is also the risk of \"cannibalization\" as the company densifies its store count in existing markets like Florida and California. Analyst Opinion of SFM Stock Thus, analysts remain cautiously optimistic about the SFM stock, attributing to it a rating of “Moderate Buy,” with a mean target price of $105.92. This indicates an upside potential of about 56% from current levels. Out of 16 analysts covering the stock, seven have a “Strong Buy” rating, one has a “Moderate Buy” rating, and eight have a “Hold” rating. www.barchart.com On the date of publication, Pathikrit Bose did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE: NOG ) is included among the 12 Best Crude Oil Stocks to Buy as Tensions Rise . Analyst Reduces Northern Oil and Gas (NOG) Price Target to $24 Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NYSE:NOG) is the largest publicly traded, non-operated upstream energy asset owner in the United States, engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas properties. On January 23, Morgan Stanley lowered the firm’s price target on Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NYSE:NOG) from $26 to $24, but maintained its ‘Underweight’ rating on the shares. The firm updated its 2026-27 oil price forecasts as of January 7, in conjunction with its Q4 preview for E&Ps, oil majors, and Canadian producers. The analyst expects the Q4 operational updates to be ‘fairly clean’, while it projects lighter cash flow from price realizations. Earlier on January 21, Mizuho also slightly reduced its price target on Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NYSE:NOG) from $30 to $29, while keeping an ‘Outperform’ rating on the shares. The revised target, which still indicates an upside of over 13% from current levels, is part of the firm’s Q4 preview. The analyst cited wider natural gas differentials as the reason for the lowered target, but noted that NOG should see some stabilization in activity this year. While we acknowledge the potential of NOG as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

(NYSE:VIST) is a leading independent operator, with its main assets in Vaca Muerta, the largest shale oil and shale gas play under development outside North America. Vista Energy, S.A.B. de C.V. (NYSE:VIST) received a boost on February 4 when BofA resumed coverage of the stock with a ‘Buy’ rating and a price target of $88, indicating an upside of over 63% from the current share price. The move comes after Vista announced the acquisition of Equinor’s onshore business in Argentina’s Vaca Muerta basin on February 2. The $1.1 billion deal includes the Norwegian energy giant’s 30% stake in the Bandurria Sur production asset and its 50% holding in Bajo del Toro. The Bandurria Sur assets produced an average of 24,400 boed in the third quarter of 2025, while Bajo del Toro, which is still in an early development phase, reported an output of 2,100 net boed. Miguel Galuccio, CEO of Vista Energy, S.A.B. de C.V. (NYSE:VIST), commented: “The blocks fit perfectly into Vista’s portfolio, adding both flowing barrels and a deep inventory of highly productive, ready-to-drill wells that will underpin our growth trajectory.” BofA views the transaction as positive when concluded. The firm estimates a potential IRR of 24% for the proposed acquisition under its Brent crude price assumptions.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the press release or in the presentation posted this morning to the Investor Relations section of our website at yeti.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Matthew. Thanks, Arvind, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining today. Matthew J. Reintjes: The strong performance YETI delivered in Q4 is a direct result of growing brand strength and disciplined, consistent execution of our long-term strategy. Just as important, our Q4 results give us increasing conviction in the long-term trajectory of the brand, our ability to accelerate growth and profitability, and to generate strong returns for our shareholders. There are three themes I want to emphasize this morning. First, our strong finish to 2025 sets the stage for meaningful global growth and profitability in 2026 and beyond. Second, our product innovation engine is operating with more speed, breadth, and global capability than ever. Story Continues Third, our expanding global brand combined with a broader, higher velocity product portfolio will be the driving force behind the next phase of YETI's growth. Beginning with our Q4 performance, we closed out 2025 with our strongest quarter of the year, delivering 5% net sales growth fueled by continued momentum across the YETI brand. Drinkware grew 6% and international delivered 25% growth, marking our best quarterly performance of the year for both. Gross margins exceeded expectations, even in an intense tariff and promotional holiday environment thanks to YETI's premium brand strengths, innovation across the portfolio, and operational execution. We once again delivered strong full-year free cash flow of $212,000,000, exceeding adjusted net income and underscoring the cash generating strength of our operating model. We executed a $125,000,000 in share repurchase during Q4, bringing the full year total to approximately $300,000,000. Across the business, demand remained solid, our portfolio is more diversified, more global, and more durable, with momentum across categories, channels, and markets. This performance is a result of deliberate multiyear actions. Grounding and broadening Drinkware, expanding bags and soft coolers within coolers and equipment, investing in our innovation footprint, globalizing the brand, and reinforcing supply chain diversification and resilience. These decisions have positioned us well for sustained multiyear growth. Looking ahead, we entered 2026 with stronger global brand momentum, and a broader product expansion opportunity than at any point in our history. While the consumer environment continues to be in debate, the fundamentals of our strategy remain sound, giving us conviction in our long-term opportunity. For 2026, we expect 6% to 8% net sales growth shaped by strength in our innovation pipeline and our brand, and expanding global reach. Over the long term, we continue to see the path toward high single digit to low double digit growth. We remain grounded in the same strategic growth priorities that have guided us through the past few years: driving product innovation, broadening our brand and addressable market, expanding our global presence. These pillars position us well as we enter 2026 with a higher capacity innovation engine, solid global demand signals, and a more diversified growth model. Product innovation anchored in durability, performance, and design remains the foundation of our long-term growth strategy. The portfolio is built on the strength of our two foundational categories, Drinkware and Coolers & Equipment, and 13 unique and scalable product platforms. Importantly, we entered 2026 with one of our strongest pipelines in years, Thailand, and Vietnam, supported by innovation teams across Austin, Bozeman, Denver, enabling a robust global innovation cycle allowing us to prototype faster, expand categories more efficiently, and bring a global scale to product development. Turning to Drinkware. We delivered 6% global growth in Q4, bolstered by innovation and expansion offsetting category cleanup discussed throughout 2025. While certain trend-driven styles in the category remained highly promotional, our broadening product platforms drove the business, and we entered 2026 with a refreshed assortment, stronger global traction, and clear line of sight to continued growth. In 2025, we further broadened our definition of the Drinkware category. Today, we innovate across four platforms: bottles and jugs; cups, mugs, and tumblers; tableware, coffeeware, barware, and containers; and finally, cookware. Let me share a few examples of recent expansion. We launched the Silo 40-ounce and half-gallon jugs built for the job site and the sidelines, broadened our health and wellness assortment with the Yonder shaker bottles, added new high-capacity leakproof products with travel straw mugs, expanded color and personalization capabilities including collegiate, NFL, and team-inspired designs, and recently extended our premium ceramic line formats in Drinkware. We also advanced our lineup through early limited release carbon steel cookware and grew our offering in vacuum sealed food jars and bowls. We have additional innovation waves planned for 2026, supporting the acceleration we expect during the year. These initiatives create broader uses for consumers, expanding our addressable market beyond traditional drinkware. Demand in Coolers & Equipment remains exceptionally healthy, with strong sell-through across DayTrip soft cooler bags and Camino totes. Camino continued to broaden consumer reach, while DayTrip remained a standout performer in soft cooler bags. In hard coolers, we lapped a tough comparison with the very successful 2024 innovation in key product transition from a year ago. Overall, hard coolers continue to be a core product platform with particular consumer demand for high per",

The revised target indicates an upside of over 44% from the current levels. On the same day, YPF Sociedad Anónima (NYSE:YPF) signed a joint development agreement with Italian Eni and UAE-based XRG to advance Argentina LNG, a large-scale integrated gas and liquefaction project that will help position the South American country as a long-term global LNG supplier. The project, expected to deliver 12 million tons per annum (tpa) of LNG capacity via two floating facilities, is designed to include production, processing, transportation, and LNG export infrastructure. Under the agreement, the three partners will start front-end engineering and design and perform other key technical, commercial, and financing workstreams.

Matador Resources (MTDR) Downgraded to 'Equal Weight' Matador Resources Company (NYSE:MTDR) is an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development, production, and acquisition of oil and natural gas resources in the United States, with an emphasis on shale and other unconventional plays. Matador Resources Company (NYSE:MTDR) had a setback on January 27 when Wells Fargo downgraded the stock from ‘Overweight’ to ‘Equal Weight’, while also trimming its price target from $71 to $47. The analyst believes that MTDR’s valuation ‘increasingly incorporates a range of structural considerations’, including higher capital intensity, variability in recent productivity trends, and a growth‑oriented strategy in a market that favors discipline. Wells Fargo noted that while the energy company’s progress on capital efficiency or midstream monetization could help improve investor sentiment, the stock offers a more balanced risk/reward at current levels compared to industry peers. Similarly, earlier on January 23, Morgan Stanley analyst Devin McDermott also reduced the firm’s price target on Matador Resources Company (NYSE:MTDR) from $56 to $52, but maintained its ‘Equal Weight’ rating on the shares.

      "content": "Friday Could Be a Big Day for Markets Matthew Benjamin, The Motley Fool Thu, February 19, 2026 at 10:13 AM CST 3 min read NVDA INTC This Friday could see some significant movement in U.S. financial markets. That's because on Friday morning, Feb. 20, at 8:30 a.m. ET, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) will publish the Fed's preferred measure of inflation , the Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index. It's a data point well worth monitoring, because the Federal Reserve will be watching it extremely closely. It could set the tone for monetary policy for the rest of 2026, and it could move markets. Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » Image source: Getty Images. While many investors pay more attention to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and it tends to get more media attention, the Fed actually prefers the PCE Price Index. According to the Cleveland Fed, that's because \"the PCE price index offers a broader and more comprehensive measure of inflation and more quickly picks up adjustments in consumers' choices in response to price changes.\" For those reasons, the Fed's 2% target for the annual inflation rate is based on the PCE Price Index, not the CPI. One recent measure of inflation says it's moderating The CPI is still important. Last Friday, we got a better-than-expected reading from that inflation measure. Consumer prices rose 2.4% (on an annual basis) in January, while economists had expected them to rise 2.5% over a year ago. Taking out volatile food and energy prices, the Consumer Price Index was up 2.5%, the lowest level since April 2021. The market opened higher that day due to the CPI data. If the PCE Price Index confirms that inflation has moderated in recent months, which many analysts expect, it would confirm the CPI report. That would mean that after many months of remaining stubbornly above the Fed's target level, inflation is finally starting to move down again toward it. That would give the Fed leeway to make additional cuts to its benchmark interest rate this year. Right now, the futures market is pricing in two quarter-percentage point cuts in 2026. But it's slowly moving toward three cuts, due to last Friday's CPI report and comments from some Fed officials that additional rate cuts are increasingly possible this year. In fact, this week, Austan Goolsbee, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said there may be potential for additional rate cuts this year. Lower rates -- or just the possibility of them -- would be a big shot in the arm for the stock market . Expectations of easier borrowing create optimism that companies will be able to both cut their interest expenses and borrow more to grow, while more favorable financing for consumers should boost their spending. Story Continues So watch the PCE Price Index on Friday, about an hour before market open. It could tell you which way the market will go that day.

On January 27, Wells Fargo analyst Hanwen Chang slightly raised the firm’s price target on Permian Resources Corporation (NYSE:PR) from $16 to $17, while keeping an ‘Overweight’ rating on the shares. The analyst highlighted that the macro oil environment remains pressured by surging output from OPEC and non-OPEC producers, pointing to a near-term supply glut that is weighing on prices. Amid the difficult outlook, Wells Fargo prefers frameworks with low reinvestment and strong capital discipline. On the other hand, earlier on January 26, Susquehanna reduced its price target on Permian Resources Corporation (NYSE:PR) from $20 to $18, but kept its ‘Positive’ rating on the stock. The revision, which still indicates an upside of over 6% from the current share price, comes as the analyst firm updated its targets in the E&P group as part of a Q4 preview.

SM Energy (SM) Completes Merger with Civitas Resources SM Energy Company (NYSE:SM) is an independent energy company focused on the exploration, exploitation, development, acquisition, and production of natural gas and crude oil in the United States. SM Energy Company (NYSE:SM) announced on January 30 that it had closed its all-stock merger with Civitas Resources, creating a larger independent producer that will continue to trade under the SM Energy name. First announced in November 2025, the deal is valued at around $12.8 billion, including debt. Following the merger, SM shareholders now hold 48% of the combined company, with the remaining 52% going to Civitas shareholders. The merged firm will hold about 823,000 net acres across the top U.S. shale basins, including Permian and Denver-Julesburg. The transaction is expected to save SM Energy Company (NYSE:SM) between $200 million and $300 million annually by reducing overhead and operating costs. According to S&P Global, the merger is expected to help SM Energy Company (NYSE:SM) grow its total output by 133% YoY to 484,000 boepd in FY 2026, with production in the Permian Basin alone projected to jump by 186% YoY. The firm expects SM’s total revenue to more than double in 2026, rising 103% YoY to around $6.5 billion. Beth McDonald, President and CEO of SM Energy Company (NYSE:SM), commented: “Today’s close marks the start of our work together as one SM, a top 10 U.S. independent oil-focused producer, with a larger, complementary footprint across the highest‑return U.S. shale basins—including a premier Permian position. We are focused on effectively integrating the two companies to unlock additional free cash flow by achieving our previously announced annual synergy target of $200 to $300 million and executing our previously announced divestiture target of at least $1.0 billion over the next year. We expect these steps to further strengthen our balance sheet, accelerate our return of capital to stockholders, and drive considerable upside in our equity. We look forward to sharing our 2026 operating plan and our updated return of capital framework on our upcoming conference call in late February.” While we acknowledge the potential of SM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

(NYSE: OVV ) is included among the 12 Best Crude Oil Stocks to Buy as Tensions Rise . Ovintiv (OVV) Initiated with 'Equal Weight' Rating, $44 Price Target Ovintiv Inc. (NYSE:OVV), a leading North American exploration and production company focused on developing its high-quality, multi-basin portfolio. On February 3, Stephens initiated coverage of Ovintiv Inc. (NYSE:OVV) with an ‘Equal Weight’ rating and a price target of $44. The analyst believes that despite its ‘operational prowess’, the stock is attractively valued, with an estimated 2026 EV/EBITDA ratio of 3.6x, 30% below the large-cap oil peer group average of 5.1x. Stephens highlighted that Ovintiv Inc. (NYSE:OVV)’s divestment of Anadarko Basin assets could make the company around $3.5 billion. This will allow the E&P firm to bolster its balance sheet, reduce net debt by over 65% this year, and increase shareholder returns. Also on February 3, Ovintiv Inc. (NYSE:OVV) announced it had closed its previously announced acquisition of NuVista Energy, valued at $2.7 billion. The strategic move is expected to add around 930 net 10,000-foot equivalent well locations and approximately 140,000 net acres in the core of the oil-rich Alberta Montney. The company expects the acquired assets to produce an average of approximately 100 mboe/d in FY 2026. Brendan McCracken, President and CEO of Ovintiv Inc. (NYSE:OVV), commented: “These top decile rate of return assets in the heart of the Montney oil window are an exceptional fit with our existing acreage and infrastructure. The team at NuVista did a great job building these assets and we are excited to apply our industry-leading expertise to the combined position. We expect to generate cost synergies of approximately $100 million annually, including per well cost savings of approximately $1 million, consistent with our current Montney well costs.” McCracken continued, “The combination of this transaction with the planned divestiture of our Anadarko assets, will streamline and high-grade our portfolio, help us to meet or exceed our debt target, and uniquely position us with significant inventory duration in the two most valuable oil plays in North America, the Permian and the Montney.” While we acknowledge the potential of OVV as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "content": "3 Medicare Mistakes That Could Increase Your Healthcare Bills in Retirement Maurie Backman, The Motley Fool Thu, February 19, 2026 at 10:06 AM CST 4 min read While some of your expenses may decrease in retirement, your healthcare costs may inevitably go up. That could come as a result of aging or losing an employer health insurance plan that had fantastic benefits. The good news is that there are steps you can take to lower your healthcare bills as a Medicare enrollee. But if that's your goal, it's important to avoid these three mistakes. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks » Image source: Getty Images. 1. Signing up late You might think that a late Medicare enrollment is no big deal. In reality, it could cost you money for the rest of your life. Your initial Medicare enrollment window is seven months long, giving most people ample time to sign up before having to worry about surcharges. That period starts three months before the month of your 65th birthday, and it ends three months after that month. If you don't sign up for Medicare when you're first eligible, rest assured that you'll have opportunities to enroll in the future. But you may not get to control the timing of your enrollment if you miss your initial window, since you'll then typically be limited to Medicare's general enrollment period, which runs from Jan. 1 through March 31 every year. Meanwhile, signing up late for Medicare could result in a 10% surcharge on your Part B premiums for each 12-month period you were eligible for coverage but didn't enroll. And that surcharge doesn't go away -- ever. So if you want to avoid it, pay attention to when you're supposed to enroll in Medicare initially and make that happen. 2. Choosing the wrong coverage Once you're eligible for Medicare, you can choose your specific coverage. That could mean sticking with original Medicare and adding a Part D drug plan. Or, it could mean getting an all-in-one Medicare Advantage plan . It's important to choose the coverage that's best for your situation, and to review your plan choices each year during Medicare's fall open enrollment period. Selecting the wrong plan could leave you with higher costs. When comparing plan options, be sure to look at factors such as: Monthly premium costs Deductibles Maximum out-of-pocket limits (which don't apply to original Medicare but do apply to Medicare Advantage plans) 3. Not buying Medigap right away If you sign up for a Medicare Advantage plan, you'll have a maximum out-of-pocket limit you're responsible for each year. But if you stick with original Medicare, there's no limit to your out-of-pocket spending. Story Continues That's why it's important to buy Medigap coverage, which is supplemental insurance that could pick up the tab for costs like deductibles and coinsurance. And your initial window to do so lasts six months and starts the first day of the month in which you're 65 and enrolled in Medicare Part B. If you don't buy Medigap during that initial six-month window, a couple of things might happen. First, going without supplemental insurance could leave you grappling with very expensive bills. Secondly, buying Medigap beyond your initial enrollment window could leave you paying more for it, since at that point, you'll be subject to underwriting and insurers can charge you more based on your health. The less you have to spend on healthcare in retirement, the more money you'll have to enjoy your life. Do your best to avoid these Medicare mistakes that could drive your healthcare bills through the roof.

(NASDAQ: VNOM ) is included among the 12 Best Crude Oil Stocks to Buy as Tensions Rise . Is Viper Energy (VNOM) Among the Best Crude Oil Stocks to Invest in? Viper Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:VNOM) is a publicly traded Delaware corporation focused on owning and acquiring mineral and royalty interests, primarily in the Permian Basin. On January 23, Morgan Stanley analyst Devin McDermott slightly lowered the firm’s price target on Viper Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:VNOM) from $45 to $44, while maintaining an ‘Overweight’ rating on the shares. The revision comes as the analyst firm marked its 2026-27 oil price forecast in conjunction with its Q4 preview for E&Ps, oil majors, and Canadian producers. While the firm expects ‘fairly clean’ operational updates in Q4, it is forecasting lower cash flow from price realizations. Similarly, earlier on January 21, Barclays analyst Betty Jiang also reduced the firm’s price target on Viper Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:VNOM) from $60 to $54, but kept its ‘Overweight’ rating on the shares. The adjustment comes as Barclays updated its ratings and targets in the E&P sector as part of a Q4 preview. The analyst firm believes that the upstream sector’s cash return model ‘remains resilient’ amid the overall volatility and sees attractive investment opportunities in the US onshore. Viper Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:VNOM) is set to announce its Q4 2025 results on February 23. While we acknowledge the potential of VNOM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Caitlyn Moorhead Thu, February 19, 2026 at 10:06 AM CST 6 min read SelectStock / Getty Images/Vetta If you feel like the tax man is chasing you, you may be able to lose him if you are exempt from federal tax withholding. However, figuring out your status and allowances can get a little confusing, especially when tax season rolls around and questions about refunds come up. Many workers notice little or no federal income tax taken out of their paychecks and wonder if they are exempt, or better yet, if they’ll get a refund. Don’t count your chickens just yet, as the answer depends on several factors, including your income, filing status, tax credits and how you completed your Form W-4. So, what does it really mean to be exempt from federal withholding? Who qualifies, and can you still receive a tax refund ? Here is a guide to help you file with confidence and avoid costly mistakes. How Do I Know If I Am Exempt From Federal Withholding? Form W-4 is an IRS tax form completed by an employee to indicate their current tax situation. You usually complete a Form W-4 when you start a new job or your financial situation changes. This form helps you estimate your total income and the total amount of your deductions and certain tax credits to let your employer know how much federal income tax to withhold from each paycheck. You are exempt from federal income tax withholding in 2026 if you had no federal income tax liability in 2025 and expect none in 2026, meaning your total tax is zero. However, you can still get a refund if you qualify for refundable credits, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit or others, when you file your return. Keep in mind that exempt status must be renewed annually, and was due Feb. 15. Check Out: Here’s How Much Your State Collects on Every Type of Tax For You: 9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week) If you cannot claim exemption from withholding, you can still reduce the amount withheld from every paycheck by entering the dollar amount of your deductions and claiming your dependents and dependent-related tax credits on Form W-4 . As you add deductions and credits, your tax withholding will decrease and your take-home pay will increase. When you claim fewer deductions and credits, your tax withholding increases and you see less in your paycheck. This is often a delicate balance. You don’t want to claim too many adjustments to your income, as your employer will not withhold enough tax based on your filing status. This could leave you with a big tax bill come April. Yet, not claiming all the adjustments you’re entitled to means you’ll have to wait for your tax refund to get your overpayment back. Story Continues What Does It Mean To Be Exempt From Federal Withholding? Being exempt from federal withholding means your employer will not withhold federal income tax from your paycheck. When you claim certain deductions, they get subtracted from your annual gross income. This causes your taxable income to decrease as well. For the 2025 tax year, the IRS has increased the standard deduction amounts due to inflation . Key amounts include $31,500 for married filing jointly, $23,625 for heads of household, and $15,750 for single filers or married individuals filing separately. These higher deductions are part of inflation adjustments for taxes filed in 2026. Who Is Exempt From Federal Income Tax? Simply put, if you earn less than the standard deduction or receive government assistance with your living expenses, you might be able to claim an exemption. Unsurprisingly, most of these exceptions are based on income level, and typically, people with lower income are the ones who qualify for the exemption from federal income tax. Here are a few key notes and examples: Student: You are not automatically exempt as a student. If you are a seasonal or part-time worker, you may qualify for this exemption. Age 65 or older: If Social Security is your only source of income, then you do not need to file a tax return. Social Security is not included in gross income. Fun fact: The IRS considers you age 65 the day before your actual birthday. Visually impaired: Due to the cost of living, there is a higher standard deduction for those who are blind. This includes individuals who cannot see 20/200 with glasses or contacts or whose field of vision is 20 degrees or less. If you are a low-income filer, you may be eligible for various tax credits and deductions. However, keep in mind that this exemption does not apply to Social Security or Medicare tax. It’s also important to note that exemptions expire every year. If you claim an exemption but your situation changes at a later time, you must file a new Form W-4 within 10 days after the change. This exemption is only good for one year, and you must file by Feb. 15 of each year to continue your exemption. Do You Still Get a Refund If You’re Exempt From Federal Withholding? Being exempt from withholding doesn’t necessarily mean you won’t receive a refund, but it does change how and when taxes are paid to the IRS. In some cases, taxpayers qualify for an exemption because they owe no federal income tax, while in others, insufficient withholding can lead to surprises at tax time. Taxpayers really don’t love having to figure this out, nor do they like any confusion when it comes to filing taxes, but the anticipation of a large refund is always a nice reward. The IRS will issue tax refunds when you have overpaid. You receive this money only because you have paid more than what you owe. When you file for an exemption from withholding, you are not making any tax payments throughout the year. Since you are not paying any taxes, you typically will not qualify for a tax refund. However, there are exceptions. For example, you could potentially still obtain a refund if you qualify to claim a refundable tax credit, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. This benefits low- to moderate-income people and reduces the amount of taxes you owe. With tax season in full swing, it’s important to stay informed when it comes to tax withholding. If you are unsure whether you qualify for an exemption or a tax credit, visit the IRS website for more details or contact a professional accountant.
