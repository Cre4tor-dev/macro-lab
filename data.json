      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT A blood test aimed at early detection of cancer failed to reduce late-stage cancers in a major clinical trial, the test’s maker, Grail, announced on Thursday . The results cast doubt on a developing field of screening for diseases that has generated enormous hopes and investment. The goal of the blood tests is to save and extend lives by detecting cancers when they can be more easily and successfully treated. Grail’s blood test was even briefly featured in a Super Bowl advertisement this month. Grail’s test, known as Galleri, looks for minuscule shards of cancer DNA in the blood and for more than 50 types of cancer, according to the company. It has been sold in the United States since 2021 and costs $949. Even though it is not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the company sells it under a regulatory loophole that permits sales of certain tests without review. Very few insurers cover the test, so most people pay for it out of pocket. Grail has sold nearly half a million of the tests so far, including more than 185,000 last year. The company lobbied heavily for the U.S. government to cover the test under Medicare. The spending package passed by Congress and signed into law by President Trump earlier this month authorized Medicare to cover cancer detection tests, and Galleri could be among those that qualify to receive the government’s approval. Grail, which has its headquarters in Silicon Valley, announced the results of the study in a news release. The company plans to present more detailed results from the study at a cancer conference in the spring. Cancer researchers had been closely watching the Grail study, which the company ran in partnership with the National Health Service of Britain. The study’s size and design promised to rigorously help answer the question of whether such tests were effective at catching cancer early. The study enrolled 142,000 healthy adults ages 50 to 77 in Britain and followed them over three years. People had their blood drawn three times, each spaced about a year apart. One group of participants’ blood samples were run through the Galleri test, and those people were referred for medical care if they tested positive. The company compared the group that underwent Galleri screening with another group that didn’t get the test. Recipients of the Galleri test did not show a significant reduction in the cancers diagnosed at Stage 3, when the disease would have grown or spread near its original site, or Stage 4, when the cancer would have spread to other parts of the body, according to the company. In a call with analysts on Thursday, Grail executives said they were encouraged by other findings that were not the primary goal of the study, citing a decrease in Stage 4 cancers as one promising result. “It’s absolutely right to say we didn’t hit the primary endpoint,” Harpal Kumar, Grail’s chief scientific officer, said. “But what we did see was a very compelling clinical benefit here.” Standard screening tests are commonly used to detect cancer of the breast, colon, cervix and prostate. But most people who die from cancer had types for which there aren’t routine tests, which is why there were such high hopes for tests like Galleri. But diagnosing cancer sooner does not always mean people live longer. And because the tests can sometimes fail to detect cancers, there is a risk that people given the all-clear may be lulled into a false sense of security and skip their regular mammogram or colonoscopy. The new law authorizing Medicare coverage of such cancer tests creates a path for test makers like Grail to receive coverage; Galleri is not automatically covered. Grail has also applied for F.D.A. approval for the Galleri test, which if granted could open the door for more insurance coverage. But the failed trial in Britain could sour regulators’ view of the test. Rebecca Robbins is a Times reporter covering the pharmaceutical industry.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The U.S. economy slowed at the end of 2025 to cap a volatile year in which consumers and an A.I. investment boom helped keep growth on track despite tariffs, uncertainty and the longest government shutdown in history. Gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, grew at a 1.4 percent annual rate in the final three months of the year, the Commerce Department said on Friday. That was down sharply from a 4.4 percent rate in the third quarter, partly because of the prolonged shutdown. The shutdown left hundreds of thousands of public sector employees temporarily without paychecks. Furloughed workers eventually received back-pay, and economists believe the shutdown’s long-term impact on G.D.P. will be small. But the episode may have lowered growth by about one percentage point at the end of 2025; the subsequent rebound should lift growth by a similar amount in early 2026. The numbers are preliminary and will be revised at least twice in the coming months. For 2025 as a whole, measured from the end of 2024, G.D.P. increased 2.2 percent, compared with 2.3 percent the previous year. That represented solid growth, once again surprising forecasters, who in recent years have repeatedly predicted slowdowns or outright recessions, only to see growth continue. “For three years now there’s been this conceit that this is the year the economy slows down,” said Aditya Bhave, an economist at Bank of America. What the growth figures show, he said, is that “this is a very solid, very resilient economy.” That resilience was tested in 2025. Mr. Trump’s on-again, off-again trade wars, his assaults on institutions like the Federal Reserve and the Bureau of Labor Statistics , and his mercurial dealings with private companies and sovereign states alike created an uncertain environment that made businesses reluctant to hire and invest. His ever-shifting trade policies also disrupted the economic data itself, as statistical agencies struggled to account for big swings in imports and inventories. Underneath the overall growth figures is a more complicated story . Consumer spending is being driven primarily by wealthier households . Important sectors of the economy, including housing, are mired in a slump. Mr. Trump’s trade policies have taken a toll on farmers and factories, and driven up the price of imported goods . Two forces drove the strength of the economy last year: consumer spending and artificial intelligence . Consumer spending, long the engine of U.S. economic growth , increased at a 2.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter, and grew 2.2 percent over the full year. Low unemployment and rising wages helped lift spending, as did a strong stock market — itself partly the result of investor enthusiasm for A.I.-related companies. The race to develop and deploy ever-better artificial intelligence models, meanwhile, contributed to growth because of the industry’s voracious appetite for data centers and the electricity to power them. Many of the chips and other components that go into such facilities are imported, meaning they aren’t counted in G.D.P. But A.I.-related investments still helped drive the 3.7 percent growth rate in business investment in the fourth quarter. The A.I. boom helped mask weakness elsewhere in the economy. Construction of new factories fell in 2025. So did home building. “It’s a winner take all construction economy,” said Anirban Basu, chief economist at Associated Builders and Contractors, a trade group. “If you’re a large general contractor that can manage large data center projects, you’re a winner. If you’re a smaller contractor, the world is increasingly difficult.” The reliance on A.I. could make the economy vulnerable if investors sour on the industry. So far, however, most forecasters are predicting that growth will accelerate in 2026. Tax cuts passed by Congress last year should help consumers and businesses in the short-term, as should the interest rate cuts that Federal Reserve policymakers enacted late last year. If trade policy also stabilizes in 2026, that will also help businesses become more confident. Ben Casselman is the chief economics correspondent for The Times. He has reported on the economy for nearly 20 years.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Image Image A big sell-off in the shares of private credit firms has the market on edge. Credit... Brendan McDermid/Reuters In today's newsletter: Has the reckoning started for private credit? A different inflation problem Picture of the day A new kind of global trade alliance Andrew here. Anxiety about private credit is growing following a strategic flip-flop from Blue Owl Capital, which lent aggressively to software companies now being disrupted by artificial intelligence. A major source of concern is the broad push to sell “semi-liquid” instruments to U.S. retail investors. Billed as the future of private equity, these vehicles have a big flaw: They can “gate” investor withdrawals. It’s a mechanism meant to protect the fund during market upheaval — but it can also further undermine investor confidence. If the industry is dead-set on attracting retail investors, it may be time to change how these vehicles work. Here’s an idea: Why not move these assets into so-called target-date funds with longer time horizons? It could ensure that only those who won’t need their money for decades are invested. In other words, it may reduce the risk of a “run on the bank” while giving savers the yield they crave. Has the reckoning started for private credit? Shares in private credit giants — especially Blue Owl Capital, the particularly hard-hit lender — remain under pressure this morning after a blood bath on Thursday. Yet while some on Wall Street remain confident about the sector, others warn that a potential reckoning may have only just begun. The latest: The stocks of lenders including Apollo, Ares and Blackstone were shellacked on Thursday after Blue Owl altered how investors in one of its most prominent funds can withdraw (or “redeem”) their money. Blue Owl said it would decide how much investors can take back every quarter, rather than letting them redeem a set amount. Investors have worried about private credit for months now, after it soared in popularity in recent years . Skeptics of private credit have warned that the lightly regulated sector could face big losses if an economic downturn reveals that lenders had overextended themselves with bad loans. (Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase memorably warned last fall of potential “cockroaches” coming to light.) More recently, private credit investors have worried about stock swoons for enterprise software companies , to which private lenders are heavily exposed. Was the Blue Owl fund a “canary in the coal mine?” That metaphor was used by observers including Mohamed El-Erian , the former C.E.O. of Pimco. Dan Rasmussen , the founder of the investment firm Verdad, predicted to CNBC, “The private markets bubble is finally starting to burst.” Defenders say that’s not necessarily the case. Blue Owl disclosed that it had sold $1.4 billion worth of loans from three funds, taking virtually no loss. Nearly half of the proceeds went to redeem investors in one of the funds. “I’m getting congratulations from everyone in our industry,” Craig Packer, a Blue Owl co-president, told The Times about the loan sale. Bill Katz, an analyst at TD Cowen, wrote in a research note on Thursday that the transaction suggested “there are no ‘cockroaches’ lurking in the portfolio.” That said, shares in Blue Owl are down in premarket trading on Friday. Keep an eye on Washington. While the Trump administration has introduced rules making it easier for individual investors to put money in private equity, including private credit, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also pushed to deregulate banks to help them better compete . Senator Elizabeth Warren , Democrat of Massachusetts, urged the Trump administration on Thursday to “wake up” and demand more disclosures and stress tests for private lenders — especially with retail investors’ money on the line in funds like the Blue Owl vehicle. If Democrats make gains in the midterm elections, expect potentially more heat on the sector. HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING The fallout from the Epstein files spreads. Bill Gates canceled a speech for an artificial intelligence event in India amid renewed scrutiny over his ties to Jeffrey Epstein. Emails have emerged showing Ben Goertzel , a prominent A.I. researcher, congratulating Epstein on his release from jail after being convicted of sex crimes. An advisory firm founded by Peter Mandelson, the veteran British politician and longtime Epstein friend, collapsed . And Bard College has begun an “independent review” into its president over his ties to Epstein. U.S. imports hit a record in 2025, in spite of President Trump’s tariffs. Imports rose 5 percent last year to $4.3 trillion , even as the trade deficit fell slightly to $901.5 billion. That meant America continued to be a net importer , despite Trump arguing that the levies would make the U.S. a major exporter. Of note: Imports of goods from China dropped nearly 30 percent, to their lowest level since 2009 — but U.S. exports to China fell by nearly as much. New York drops a plan to allow robotaxis. Gov. Kathy Hochul pulled a proposal that would have allowed commercial autonomous vehicles to operate outside of New York City, which labor groups and taxi drivers had opposed. The decision is a blow to Alphabet’s Waymo (which planned to provide more than one million paid weekly robotaxi rides in the U.S. by the end of 2026), Tesla and other service providers. Image A different inflation problem President Trump and Fed policymakers largely agree that the economy is doing fine. But when it comes to America’s affordability crunch, an issue of huge importance to voters, the president and central bankers are growing further apart. That widening gap may cause problems for Kevin Warsh, the president’s pick to succeed Jay Powell as Fed chair after his term expires in May. The situation that awaits Warsh could come into sharper focus later this morning with the release of the Consumer Price Expenditures report, the Fed’s preferred measure on inflation. It’s expected to show that inflation in December remained well above the Fed’s 2 percent target and was showing little sign of easing. The White House and Wall Street will also be watching the Supreme Court. The court is slated to release its latest opinions on Friday, and next Tuesday and Wednesday. Businesses have been anxiously awaiting the justices’ ruling on the legality of Trump’s most bruising tariffs, those justified under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. Trump took on inflation and tariffs on Thursday. If the court were to invalidate the tariffs, most importers would rejoice. (New research by the JPMorganChase Institute shows that tariffs are especially walloping midsize U.S. businesses .) But that would also wipe out a potential windfall that the administration hoped to use to plug the country’s giant debt hole. “Without tariffs, this country would be in so much trouble right now,” Trump told supporters at a steel plant in northwestern Georgia. The president continued to play down inflation. He called the affordability crisis “ fake news ” on Thursday, arguing, without evidence, that he had vanquished the problem. But economists and business leaders continue to worry that a two-tiered — or K-shaped — economy is emerging in which high-wage earners are weathering high inflation while poorer households struggle. And a new inflation risk has emerged. The price of Brent crude has soared this week — it stabilized this morning around $71 a barrel — as the The Times has reported that the president is weighing strikes against Iran . Military action could disrupt a key oil exporting trade route. Trump said on Thursday that Iran would need to reach a deal with Washington over the next 10 to 15 days, “ otherwise bad things happen ” — a timeline that has left markets on edge. The uncertainty about inflation is becoming harder to ignore. Stephen Miran, the former White House economic adviser who joined the Fed last year, appe",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT There were traders wearing “Dow 50,000” caps, and bright chyrons on CNBC. Attorney General Pam Bondi told lawmakers in Congress that they, too, should be making a big deal of the Dow Jones industrial average’s crossing 50,000 for the first time. To Ms. Bondi, the Dow’s ascent was evidence that the Trump administration’s economic policies were working. She also noted that the S&P 500, another benchmark stock index, was at “almost 7,000” and that the Nasdaq Composite index, which is full of tech stocks, was “smashing records.” “Americans’ 401(k)s and retirement savings are booming,” she said. To many analysts and investors, however, the message the market is sending is far more ambiguous. The Dow has yet to spend a day above 50,000 since Ms. Bondi’s appearance on Capitol Hill last week. The S&P 500 still has yet to close above 7,000, and the Nasdaq Composite last smashed its record high in October. Major stock indexes have mostly been treading water for months, while shares in certain companies have been splashing about, erratically. More than a fifth of the stocks in the S&P 500 have moved by 20 percent or more so far in 2026. Roughly 80 of those stocks have risen, while 40 of them have fallen, even as the main index has remained roughly flat. The Vix volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, has steadily gone up this year, and oil prices are rising this week amid mounting threats that the United States will attack Iran. The stock market sell-off has been led by sharp drops for software companies that are considered at risk of displacement by artificial intelligence. But investors have also been dumping many of the marquee tech names whose share prices have ridden a wave of A.I. exuberance. Investors are growing more worried that the reality of A.I. will fall short of the market’s lofty expectations. “There are a lot of unanswered questions,” said Tiffany Wilding, an economist at the asset manager PIMCO, pointing to the labor market as one area where A.I.’s impact is hard to predict. “Whether A.I. will primarily be a substitute or a complement for labor, how quickly it diffuses across the economy and ultimately who wins versus loses are all very difficult to forecast.” Shares of Apple, Meta, Broadcom, Alphabet, Advanced Micro Devices, Palantir and Microsoft, among the biggest winners from the A.I. trade, have all fallen this year. Nvidia, the engine of the stock market in recent years, has also sputtered, trading only slightly higher for the year through Thursday. As investors have sought to diversify away from flagging enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, two sectors that have seen a sustained rise are energy and industrial stocks. Consumer staples companies have also surged this year, with Clorox and Hershey rising more than 20 percent. Materials companies like Ball and Newmont have also risen over 20 percent. Dow Inc. is up 34 percent this year. Energy companies are also rising, with Texas Pacific Land Corporation, a major landowner in the Texas oil patch, up roughly 70 percent this year. President Trump made oil central to the terms of a deal with the Venezuelan government after the United States invaded the country and captured its leader. Oil prices rose sharply again this week as U.S. tensions with Iran intensified. Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, has gone up roughly $10 per barrel this year, to around $72. Brent crude oil price “In our view, this might be a good time for investors to step off the A.I. hype train,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise. This shift in the market has favored the Dow Jones industrial average, or “the Dow,” which is up 3 percent this year and 6.5 percent since October, outpacing the S&P 500. The Nasdaq Composite has turned negative for the year. There is no doubt that the Dow remains incredibly culturally significant in American financial markets. In practice, however, Wall Street analysts, traders and economists place more emphasis on the S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite and other stock benchmarks. It comes down to three main reasons. First, very little money still tracks the Dow, with mutual funds preferring to tie their performance to other indexes. This makes the Dow less relevant to the average stockholder because other indexes will better reflect their own portfolio. Second, a stock’s weighting in the Dow depends on its price, not the company’s overall value. That means small companies with high stock prices can have a bigger impact on the index than very large companies with low stock prices. Finally, with a cohort of just 30 companies, the Dow is less reflective of the U.S. economy than other indexes. Those 30 stocks do include some of the newer tech companies that have come to dominate the American economy, but the index is still largely made up of banks, industrial companies and other businesses more reflective of the economy as it once was, but not so much as it is now. Still, they are the companies benefiting from a shift away from technology stocks and A.I.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT President Trump’s desire for significantly lower borrowing costs has run into a perpetual problem since he returned to the White House. The economy is simply not calling for that kind of support from the Federal Reserve. But a new rationale for relief that seeks to overcome this hitch has begun to gain traction. It centers on artificial intelligence and the possibility of a productivity boom that will unleash higher economic growth without stoking inflation. That, in turn, could give the Fed space to cut interest rates, the argument goes. One of the biggest proponents of this view is Kevin M. Warsh , whom Mr. Trump wants to replace Jerome H. Powell as Fed chair. Before being tapped for the job, Mr. Warsh characterized the A.I. boom as “the most productivity-enhancing wave of our lifetimes — past, present and future.” He surmised that the technology would be “structurally disinflationary,” like the internet, although conceded that the full economic impact would take time to materialize. “My sense is that the anecdotes will be there before the data,” Mr. Warsh said, forcing central bankers to “make a bet” on leaning into a potential productivity surge. Mr. Warsh might be ready to make that wager if he is confirmed by the Senate, but his soon-to-be colleagues at the Fed appear far less convinced, especially given their growing skepticism about the need to cut rates further after another year of inflation above their 2 percent target. New data released on Friday showed price pressures picking back up. The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures index rose 0.4 percent in December and is up 2.9 percent compared to the same time last year, according to data released by the Commerce Department on Friday. The “core” measure, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, accelerated to an annual pace of 3 percent. “I expect that the A.I. boom is unlikely to be a reason for lowering policy rates,” Michael S. Barr, a Fed governor, said just this week . Mr. Barr’s comments are so far the most direct on the issue, but other policymakers appear aligned. “I don’t think we are anywhere close yet to having evidence that A.I. has increased potential output that significantly,” said Athanasios Orphanides, formerly a governor at the Central Bank of Cyprus and a senior adviser at the Fed who is now at M.I.T. Sloan School of Management. “That’s why it’s tricky to use this argument to say this clearly justifies lower rates today.” 1990s Redux? Mr. Warsh’s argument relies on a simple premise. Ordinarily, the economy can grow only so quickly without triggering inflation. If factories are operating at full capacity, workers are all employed and companies are doing as much business as they can handle, then any increase in spending will result just in higher prices, not greater output. But if something — a technological breakthrough, an innovative management approach — allows businesses to produce more with the same number of workers, then output can rise without inflation picking up. That is what Mr. Warsh and others argue is happening now. And they say there is a historical precedent: the personal computing revolution of the 1990s. In the latter part of that decade, economic growth accelerated, the unemployment rate fell to historic lows, and the stock market boomed. Many economists, including some at the Fed, argued that the central bank should begin raising rates to cool off the economy and prevent a pickup in inflation. Alan Greenspan, then the Fed chair, disagreed, arguing that the United States was in the early stages of a technology-driven increase in productivity growth. He resisted the call to raise rates, arguing in a 1997 Fed meeting that the economy was in “a very unusual era.” “The pickup in productivity helps to explain why inflation remains so well contained at this stage in the expansion, despite the increasingly tight labor markets and other developments that, on the basis of our historical models, would have produced significant inflation,” Mr. Greenspan said at the time, according to meeting transcripts . Image Alan Greenspan, who as the Federal Reserve chair in the 1990s argued that the United States was in the early stages of a technology-driven increase in productivity growth. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times But critics point to differences between the two periods. For one, other factors were helping to keep a lid on inflation during Mr. Greenspan’s tenure, including rapid globalization and rising immigration. Today, the opposite is true, with Mr. Trump’s tariffs fracturing trade relations and his immigration crackdown shrinking the work force. “It’s so different that it creates sufficient uncertainty that you would not want to cut rates pre-emptively,” said Matthew Luzzetti, chief economist at Deutsche Bank. In fact, under Mr. Greenspan, the Fed was debating whether to raise rates, not whether to cut them. And while policymakers held off on making any moves for a while, they eventually did raise rates once inflation began to pick up. “Greenspan never cut rates because of productivity,” said Aditya Bhave, an economist at Bank of America. “He resisted the committee’s call to hike rates because of productivity, and he turned out to be right for a bit, and ultimately they wound up hiking anyway.” Measuring the Boom Many economists also argue that it is far from clear that the United States is in the midst of an A.I.-driven productivity boom — or a productivity boom at all. According to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, labor productivity was up 1.9 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, a respectable but hardly spectacular growth rate. That number will almost certainly be revised higher in subsequent updates to account for job growth that was slower in 2025 than initially reported — if fewer workers produced the same amount of economic output, then by definition their productivity was higher. But that anticipated revision only highlights the challenge: Productivity is notoriously hard to measure in real time. Even more than with employment, inflation and other statistics, productivity figures often change drastically as more complete data becomes available. Even when the numbers don’t change, they can be hard to interpret. Early in the pandemic, for example, productivity soared, but not because workers suddenly became better at their jobs. Low-productivity sectors like hospitality largely shut down, making overall productivity, on average, appear artificially high. “It is important to keep in mind that it’s a noisy series,” said Martha Gimbel, executive director of the Budget Lab at Yale University. “You should never hang your hat on one or two quarters of economic data, but that is particularly risky with productivity.” Even if the recent pickup in productivity is real, it isn’t clear that it’s driven by artificial intelligence, or that the gains will last. Some individual companies have begun reporting that they are seeing the benefits of artificial intelligence, but the evidence linking those gains to overall productivity growth is thin . That isn’t necessarily surprising. Research into past technological revolutions has found that they often follow a J-shaped pattern, where productivity growth initially slows as companies figure out how best to take advantage of the new technology, before it later accelerates. “That doesn’t mean it will never happen,” Ms. Gimbel said. “It just means that change is not immediate, and just because something is happening at an individual firm or for a very specific group of workers does not mean that it’s an economywide phenomenon.” Still, some prominent economists are less skeptical of A.I.’s impact. In a recent article in The Financial Times , Erik Brynjolfsson, a Stanford economist who has studied A.I., argued that the recent pickup in productivity, combined with evidence from specific industries and c",

Other key markets like Germany and France also recorded significant declines, while Britain, the largest long-haul source market for U.S. tourism, saw a marginal growth of 0.5 percent compared to the previous year. “When 11 million international visitors aren’t showing up, the result is billions of dollars in economic losses to the travel industry,” said Erik Hansen, a senior vice-president at the U.S. Travel Association, a trade group that promotes travel to and within the country. Visa Fees and Social Media Vetting The Trump administration has made it significantly harder for some travelers to enter the United States, barring visitors from more than a dozen countries and introducing a $250 “visa integrity fee” for nonimmigrant tourist and business visas designed to discourage visitors from overstaying. Visitors are also facing more rigorous vetting at the border, with increased searches of electronic devices , some resulting in detentions and denied entry. Citizens of countrieswho just need an electronic authorization to visit the United States may soon be required to provide up to five years of social media history to enter; that could result in a loss of up to $15.7 billion in visitor spending, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council. “These are the kinds of measures you expect from China or countries in the Middle East, not from America,” said Felicity Morgan, 49, a British trade auditor who lives between Amsterdam and London,referring to detentions at airports linked to social media screenings for content deemed critical of the government or a risk to national security. Last month, she canceled a trip to Miami for her friend’s 50th birthday because she didn’t want to risk losing thousands of dollars if she was denied entry.

Marco Bello/Reuters With the United States set to host the FIFA World Cup this summer and major events lined up around the country’s 250th anniversary and the Route 66 Centennial , 2026 has the potential to reverse the negative trend line, said Mr. Hansen of the U.S. Travel Association. Initial projections from Oxford Economics , the global economic advisory firm, forecast a 3.9 percent growth in international inbound travel, a modest gain that would not recoup the decline since the start of the second Trump Administration. “Ongoing policy uncertainty and enforcement actions from the Trump administration are likely to limit gains, leaving the U.S. at risk of underperforming other international destination markets again this year,” the firm said. The World Cup is expected to draw millions of soccer fans to 11 U.S. cities this summer. Still, some members of the global soccer community, including the former FIFA president Sepp Blatter, have joined calls to boycott the event in response to violence by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Brand USA, a nonprofit destination marketing organization partially funded by the federal government, said 2026 represents a “once-in-a-generation opportunity to showcase the best of the United States.” The year’s events, “make the nation an attractive draw for global travelers, and we invite visitors to experience all this year has to offer,” Fred Dixon, the organization’s president said in an email. Headwinds in Florida With so many international tourists interested in visiting Florida, the state serves as a bellwether for foreign visitation to the United States.

Fabian Sommer/picture alliance, via Getty Images Many tourists from Canada, who traditionally flock to the state in winter, avoided it last year, according to state estimates, which show a 14.7 percent decline in Canadian visitors. WestJet, the Canadian airline has cut summer flights to U.S. destinations , including Orlando, and the Montreal-based airline Air Transat announced last week that it will stop operating flights to Florida this summer. While 2025 data for overall international travel to Florida is not yet available, the total number of visitors, including those from Mexico and Canada as well as overseas destinations, declined by 1.2 percent, falling to 12.2 million people from 12.35 million, according to data from Visit Florida, the state’s official tourism marketing corporation.

John Raoux/Associated Press But when asked about the data, the organization highlighted the growth in overseas visitors, which excludes Canada, saying they were up 4 percent from 2024 and that the group expected 2025 to be a record-breaking year for tourism. “Florida is looking forward to being a hub for travelers coming to the U.S. for the World Cup,” Bryan Griffin, the group’s president and chief executive officer said in an email. In an earnings call earlier this month, Disney warned of “international visitation headwinds” at its U.S. parks. The company declined to specify reasons for the decline. Chris French, a Florida-based Disney vacation planner, said the number of his clients looking to book international Disney destinations in Paris and Tokyo over Walt Disney World has tripled. Many of those clients, he said, are Canadian fans “who have a deep affection for the theme park, but cannot see themselves relaxing in the state of Florida right now.” Summer Outlook Image Data from online travel agencies shows a decline in July bookings for flights from Europe to the United States. Credit... Rebecca Blackwell/Associated Press While it is still early in the year, airline booking analysis from the flight data company Cirium published this month showed a 14.2 percent decline in July bookings from Europe compared to last year. The data was compiled from third-party sources and online travel agencies, between Oct. 7, 2025 and Jan. 31, 2026 and does not include flights booked directly with the airlines. Key markets, including Germany and France, are also seeing a continued decline in travel agency bookings. In January, Germany updated its travel advisory to the United States, warning of increased risks from political violence, demonstrations and immigration enforcement in cities like Minneapolis. Kerstin Heinen, a spokeswoman for the German Travel Association , said she does not know why bookings continue to decline, but that the reasons “may range from political and social factors to entry requirements and price levels.” In France, tour operator sales to United",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The United States and Indonesia announced they have signed a trade deal, with Indonesia agreeing to open its borders wider to American goods. The deal, announced on Thursday, includes zero tariffs on virtually all U.S. exports to Indonesia and a 19 percent tariff on Indonesian goods. It formalizes an agreement the two countries made last July, making Indonesia the third country in Southeast Asia to lock in lower tariffs after Malaysia and Cambodia. Mr. Trump had threatened Indonesia with a 32 percent tariff at one point last year. After seven rounds of negotiations and four trips to Washington, Indonesian officials agreed to roll back several long-prevailing trade barriers, including inspections of farm products, export restrictions on critical minerals and local content requirements. Indonesia also committed to import $15 billion worth of U.S. energy including coal, oil and gas, and $13.5 billion in American airplanes and aviation equipment. Importantly, Indonesia agreed to align with Washington on using trade policy to advance U.S. national security goals. For example, the agreement said Indonesia will restrict the export or transfer from its country of any goods that are subject to U.S. export controls, including American technology. The U.S. government has increasingly used trade rules to keep certain sensitive American products out of the hands of Chinese companies. Indonesia agreed to give American companies access to its critical mineral and oil resources to “explore, mine, extract” and export. The Indonesian government has traditionally been quite cautious of opening its natural resources sector to foreign companies. The deal with Indonesia could strengthen Mr. Trump’s hand in his trade negotiations with China ahead of his expected visit to Beijing in April. But it comes with risks for Indonesia, which like other countries in Asia counts China as its biggest trade partner. Image A bag factory in Bandung, Indonesia. Credit... Ulet Ifansasti for The New York Times The governments of Malaysia and Cambodia have been under intense scrutiny both at home and regionally since signing similar agreements to cooperate with the United States on national security issues. In Malaysia, the prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, was accused by critics of sacrificing the country’s sovereignty after he made a trade pact with Mr. Trump in October. In Cambodia, the government was criticized by China, which said it had “grave concern” about the deal. Indonesia could also risk raising the ire of China, said Deborah Elms, the head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore. “The more of these that get signed, the harder it will be for China to remain quiet,” she said, adding that so far China’s response has been relatively muted. Here’s the Latest Trump Tariffs on Countries and Products See which countries and industries are being targeted by President Trump, as he seeks to remake the global trading system. China is a main customer for the palm oil, coal and nickel that drive the Indonesian economy, and Chinese investors have sunk billions of dollars into Indonesia to build factories, rail lines and other infrastructure. So interlaced is Indonesia’s economy with China’s that when China’s growth slows by one percentage point, it causes a 0.3 percentage-point decrease in Indonesian growth, according to one estimate. The agreement with Indonesia allows Mr. Trump to claim a victory as he faces growing scrutiny at home for his immigration policies and sweeping tariffs. The Supreme Court is set to consider his sweeping use of emergency powers to enforce many of his tariffs. Indonesia’s president, Prabowo Subianto, was in Washington on Thursday for a meeting of Mr. Trump’s Board of Peace , intended to solve global conflicts. Indonesia’s military said this week that it was preparing to send thousands of troops to Gaza for a peacekeeping mission, pending approval by Mr. Prabowo. While Mr. Prabowo was in Washington, Indonesia announced what it said were $38.4 billion worth of trade and investment deals with American companies to deepen private-sector cooperation between the countries. Image A nickel mining site in Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, in 2023. Credit... Ulet Ifansasti for The New York Times Indonesia was not in a strong position to bargain over the terms of the trade deal, said Priyanka Kishore, an economist in Singapore. “Already under pressure from a flood of cheap Chinese imports, these industries are not in a position to withstand steep U.S. tariffs,” said Ms. Kishore. “By signing the U.S. deal, the Prabowo administration is effectively accepting an unfair bargain in order to stave off a wave of factory closures and manufacturing layoffs.” Muktita Suhartono contributed reporting from Bangkok.

      "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/19/business/blue-owl-stock-private-credit.html",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Shares of Blue Owl Capital, the giant private lender, plunged on Thursday after the company announced that it was changing how investors can get their money out from one of its funds, raising fresh concerns about potential problems lurking in the private credit industry. Blue Owl said investors would not be able to ask for a set amount of money back every quarter. Going forward, the firm will decide how much it will pay out quarterly. On a conference call with investors, Blue Owl executives sought to portray the changes favorably, but the announcement had the opposite effect as some investors worried that the moves could lead to obstacles to redemptions. The company’s stock ended Thursday down 6 percent, after falling as much 10 percent earlier in the day. Other companies with exposure to private credit, including Ares, Apollo and Blackstone, fell more than 5 percent. Mohamed El-Erian, a Wall Street veteran and former chief executive of PIMCO, wrote on social media that Blue Owl’s change in redemption terms reminded him of the beginnings of the financial crisis when banks sought to contain the damage from the souring mortgage loans on their books. “Is this a ‘canary-in-the-coalmine’ moment, similar to August 2007?” Mr. El-Erian wrote . In just a few years, private credit has extended trillions of dollars in loans to business, and Blue Owl, which was founded in 2016, has amassed nearly $300 billion in investor money. But the industry exists outside the traditional, highly regulated banking system, and investors can see only a limited amount of information about private credit borrowers and the terms of their loans. Blue Owl’s stock had already fallen nearly 50 percent in the past year, with investors becoming increasingly concerned about the quality of its loans and whether the company can keep growing. While there have been only a handful of private credit defaults in recent months, investors have, in recent weeks, zeroed in on potential trouble spots, such as private credit exposure to software companies at a time when software is being pressured by artificial intelligence. By many estimates, at least 20 percent of the loans extended by private credit funds have gone to software companies. Blue Owl also said on Thursday that it had sold $1.4 billion in loans from three of its funds known as business development companies . The company said it would use a portion of the proceeds — $600 million — to give money back to its investors in one of its private credit funds. Blue Owl said it was able to sell the loans at nearly 100 cents on the dollar. Many industry analysts said they were relieved that Blue Owl was able to avoid a loss. In an interview, Blue Owl’s co-president Craig Packer said the loan sale was “an unequivocal extremely positive thing for our investors,” adding that “I’m getting congratulations from everyone in our industry.” Mr. Packer also said investors were misinterpreting the new redemptions rules. On the investor call Thursday, he said the firm was “simply changing the method by which we’re providing redemptions” and would be handing investors’ money back in one of its funds quicker than they had planned. In a statement, Blue Owl said that rather than returning 5 percent to investors every quarter, it would pay 30 percent of their money “immediately.” Going forward, Blue Owl said, “our intention is to continue to return capital on an accelerated basis,” but it said it would first need to discuss the matter with its board. One buyer of the loans appeared to be Kuvare, an insurance and annuity provider that Blue Owl purchased in 2024, according to Peter Troisi, a Barclays analyst. In a research note, Mr. Troisi said that while technically the loan sale was an “arm’s-length transaction,” he expressed concerns that if private credit firms were effectively on both sides of a transaction, “it would make it more difficult to track the risk.” In the interview, Mr. Packer declined to say whether Kuvare was one of the four loan buyers and said the others included state pension plans. “This was a really thorough process involving four really high-quality institutional investors in a very tight time frame,” he said.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT In October 2006, while seeking re-election as California’s Republican governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger appeared on “The Tonight Show With Jay Leno” on NBC. It seemed innocent enough: Mr. Schwarzenegger had been a guest on Mr. Leno’s show many times, and the two Hollywood stars enjoyed a warm relationship. But Mr. Schwarzenegger’s Democratic opponent protested the appearance to the Federal Communications Commission and demanded that NBC give him 15 minutes of airtime in return, citing a rule in a decades-old communications law. The “equal time” rule requires certain broadcast shows to provide equal airtime to candidates competing for the same office. Within days, the F.C.C., then under President George W. Bush, disagreed, issuing a ruling that effectively added late-night talk show interviews to an exemption that had been awarded to news programs. That exemption stuck for two decades, even as late-night television became far more political. Now, the Trump administration has effectively removed the exemption, with the newly aggressive F.C.C. making it clear last month that it would use the rule against late-night talk show hosts, who have been among the most relentless critics of President Trump. The shift could reshape the political landscape of late-night television, where most shows overwhelmingly book Democrats over Republicans. It has also raised questions about whether a rule created in 1927 to ensure that then-powerful radio networks would not have undue influence in American elections should be applied now, when there are so many avenues for political candidates to promote themselves in a vastly expanded media landscape. The issue burst into public view this week when Stephen Colbert criticized both his network, CBS, and the F.C.C. on his show, saying CBS had barred him from interviewing James Talarico, a state lawmaker running in the Democratic Senate primary in Texas, on the air, citing the agency’s shift . Mr. Colbert said, with clear exasperation, that he had never encountered such pushback in his 21-year career as a late-night talk show host, and that he expected his network to do more to defend him. “I’m just so surprised that this giant global corporation would not stand up to these bullies,” he said. CBS disputed Mr. Colbert’s version of the events, saying it had offered him “guidance” on how he could comply with the new interpretation of the rule, including offering similar airtime to two of Mr. Talarico’s Democratic opponents. Image Brendan Carr, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, has increasingly targeted late-night programming. Credit... Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images The new interpretation is being driven by Brendan Carr, the chairman of the F.C.C., who has carried out Mr. Trump’s mission in targeting television shows that are critical of the president through the use of regulatory power . Mr. Carr’s scrutiny was also behind ABC’s decision to take “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” off the air for nearly a week last September. And this month, his agency opened an investigation of “The View” over the equal time rule. Mr. Carr’s aggressive posture toward the media has set off alarm bells about the change. Some believe his latest move could have a chilling effect on invitations for candidates to appear on late-night shows, even as this year’s midterm elections get closer. “The goal here is to intimidate broadcasters,” said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, a longtime public interest lawyer. “The message to broadcasters is: Tone it down, stay out of controversy, avoid discussing political campaigns.” Mr. Schwartzman, a veteran of major media regulatory battles, added that the networks had traditionally protested this sort of action from the F.C.C., and he said he was struck at how silent they were being now. Anna M. Gomez, the F.C.C.’s lone Democratic commissioner, said at a news conference on Wednesday that she was concerned the shift would cause networks to “self-censor.” “It’s all a part of the ultimate goal of bringing these broadcasters to heel,” she said. Mr. Carr suggested this week that he hoped the change would accomplish the opposite goal. The “whole idea here is more speech, not less — you can have more candidates on,” he said. “Congress passed the equal time provision for a very specific reason,” Mr. Carr said. “They didn’t want the media elites in Hollywood and New York to put their thumb on the scale and pick the winners and losers in primaries and general elections. That’s the whole point.” At the F.C.C., Mr. Carr has dominion over the licenses that television and radio stations need to broadcast, and that are vital to distributing the major networks’ shows nationally. He has frequently warned station owners that violations of F.C.C. policies could lead the agency to refuse to renew their licenses — a posture that has struck fear into the industry. Several major broadcasters have business before the Trump administration. CBS’s parent company, Paramount, is seeking to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, a deal that would require government approval. Broadcast licenses come with requirements that they serve the “public interest,” including several rules about how stations handle content. Cable, streaming and social media do not fall under the F.C.C. requirements, and as they rose, the rules had gone largely unenforced. But Mr. Carr has worked to revive some of them, including the equal time rule. His moves come as late night has already been facing increasing pressure from a number of directions. Ratings have fallen, advertising revenue has plummeted and viewers seem more inclined to watch video podcasts than traditional shows with a studio audience, a band and celebrity guests. Image Stephen Colbert took “The Late Show” in a more political direction after becoming its host in 2015. Credit... Daniel Cole/Reuters Mr. Colbert, a veteran of Comedy Central’s liberal late-night programming, took over “The Late Show” in 2015, as late-night hosts on every network were pushing increasingly political messages on their shows. He, too, made his program newsier, to great success: “The Late Show” eclipsed “The Tonight Show” in total viewers in 2017, and it has remained the most-watched late-night show since. Still, CBS announced last year that “The Late Show” franchise would end in May, arguing that mounting financial losses, not politics, were the only reason. After Mr. Colbert’s show goes off the air, CBS will be out of the late-night business. Mr. Kimmel, the only late-night host for ABC, has openly mused about retiring for some time. Some TV executives believe that within a few years, NBC’s “The Tonight Show” could be the only late-night show left on the broadcast networks.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The husband of Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer has been barred from the department’s headquarters after at least two female staff members told officials that he had sexually assaulted them, according to people familiar with the decision and a police report obtained by The New York Times. The women said Ms. Chavez-DeRemer’s husband, Dr. Shawn DeRemer, had touched them inappropriately at the Labor Department’s building on Constitution Avenue. One of the incidents, during working hours on the morning of Dec. 18, was recorded on office security cameras, the people said. The video showed Dr. DeRemer giving one of the women an extended embrace, and was reviewed as part of a criminal investigation, one of the people said. In January, the women’s concerns about Dr. DeRemer, 57, were raised as part of an internal investigation by the department’s inspector general into alleged misconduct by Ms. Chavez-DeRemer and her senior staff, one of the people said. On Jan. 24, Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department filed a report about forced sexual contact in December at the Labor Department, according to their report, which was viewed by The Times. The police report is the only one from the last three months associated with the Labor Department’s address, a police spokesman said, adding that the Police Department’s sexual assault unit is investigating. After the women described the incidents to investigators, Dr. DeRemer was barred from entering the Labor Department’s premises, according to people familiar with the decision, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the allegations and ongoing investigations surrounding the department. “If Mr. DeRemer attempts to enter, he is to be asked to leave,” a building restriction notice viewed by The Times said. Dr. DeRemer, an anesthesiologist in Portland, Ore., who frequently visited his wife’s Washington offices, did not respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for the Department of Labor did not provide a comment. A lawyer representing Ms. Chavez-DeRemer in the inspector general investigation declined to comment. The widening misconduct scandal at the Labor Department has forced several aides and members of the security staff in Ms. Chavez-DeRemer’s inner circle onto administrative and investigative leave . The inspector general’s office is investigating a formal complaint that Ms. Chavez-DeRemer was having an inappropriate sexual relationship with a subordinate — a member of her security detail — and abusing her office by taking staff to strip clubs, drinking alcohol on the job and taking personal trips at taxpayer expense. Her lawyer has denied the allegations. President Trump nominated Ms. Chavez-DeRemer as his labor secretary in late 2024, and she was confirmed in March last year. She was a Republican congresswoman from Oregon before losing her bid for re-election in 2024. During her tenure as labor secretary, thousands of department employees have been pushed out of the federal service. Her department has also broadcast social media messages that echoed those used by white nationalists .

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Brad Reese, the grandson of the inventor of the Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup, took to LinkedIn over the weekend to defend his family’s candy name. He wasn’t happy about a bag of Valentine’s Day Reese’s Mini Hearts, a seasonal peanut-buttery treat covered in chocolate. Except the covering was not actual milk chocolate. Hershey’s, which makes Reese’s brand candies, was using a chocolate-flavored coating that can’t legally be referred to as milk chocolate, a term that is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. “I had to actually throw it in the garbage,” he said in an interview. “That’s the first time in my life I’ve ever thrown a product of Reese’s out without consuming it.” As it turns out, it wasn’t just Valentine’s Day hearts. Reese’s foil-wrapped Peanut Butter Eggs no longer contain milk chocolate, either, The New York Times found on Thursday after an investigation that involved going to a drugstore near the office to buy a bag and read the ingredients. It’s the latest of the recipe changes that have been spreading across the candy business as prices for cocoa have climbed in recent years, driven by a confluence of factors including drought, financial speculation and labor shortages. Chocolate companies including Hershey’s have responded by replacing ingredients like cocoa butter with less-expensive substitutes. An examination of candy ingredients around Halloween last year found that Hershey’s products including Rolos, Mr. Goodbar and Almond Joy no longer listed milk chocolate among their ingredients. At that time, industry experts speculated that chocolate companies were likely to reformulate less popular products before making changes to crown jewels like the Reese’s product line. Now, some seasonal Reese’s products appear to have done away with milk chocolate, too. “I looked at the packaging, and sure enough, it was chocolate coating and also peanut butter creme, which means it’s not real peanut butter,” Mr. Reese said. “It’s all vegetable fats.” After his Valentine’s Day candy-heart discovery, Mr. Reese redesigned his personal website, which previously had been devoted to promoting peanut butter cups and his family’s history. Now, it is devoted to “protecting Reese’s brand integrity.” “I felt embarrassed to even wear anything that says Reese’s on it,” Mr. Reese said. In a statement, Hershey’s said it had made recipe adjustments to some Reese’s products “that allow us to make new shapes, sizes, and innovations.” The company said Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups were being made the same way they always have been. A package of classic Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, also examined on Thursday at the Manhattan drugstore, still listed milk chocolate and peanuts as the first two ingredients. Ingredients are listed on packaged food in descending order by weight. According to a government database last updated in late 2023, Reese’s Peanut Butter Eggs used to contain more peanuts and milk chocolate than anything else. On Thursday, a nine-ounce bag of foil-covered eggs listed sugar and vegetable oil first, and no milk chocolate. The same thing was true for Mini Hearts. Cocoa crops have been battered in recent years by longer droughts, extreme heat and irregular rainfall patterns exacerbated by climate change. Tariffs, labor issues and other geopolitical factors, along with an infection carried by mealybugs, have also hurt the business. Though prices have fallen since their peak last year, cocoa remains about twice as expensive as it was in 2022. Candy makers have responded by raising prices, shrinking packaging and quietly changing their recipes. If they remove milk chocolate from the recipe, they typically change the description on the front of the package to “chocolate candy” or “chocolatey candy.” Claire Brown covers climate change for The Times and writes for the Climate Forward newsletter.

Shortly before Mr. Gates was scheduled to deliver the speech on Thursday, the Gates Foundation issued a brief statement. “After careful consideration, and to ensure the focus remains on the AI Summit’s key priorities, Mr. Gates will not be delivering his keynote address,” the Gates Foundation announced via X. The statement did not specifically mention Mr. Epstein, but the Justice Department’s recent release of millions of pages of emails, text messages and photographs has brought renewed attention to Mr. Gates. In two newly released documents, Mr. Epstein wrote notes to himself suggesting that Mr. Gates had engaged in extramarital sex and had to acquire drugs “in order to deal with consequences of sex with Russian girls.” “These claims — from a proven, disgruntled liar — are absolutely absurd and completely false,” a representative for Mr. Gates has said of those missives. The fact that Mr. Gates and Mr. Epstein, a convicted sex offender, met on numerous occasions and worked together on a potential charitable fund has been public knowledge since shortly after Mr. Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while in custody in the Metropolitan Correctional Center. The volume of messages between Mr. Gates and his representatives and Mr. Epstein, as well as photographs of Mr. Gates released by the Justice Department with women’s faces blacked out to protect their identities, raised new questions about the depth of their ties. The Epstein files’ release has brought consequences for powerful figures enmeshed in the disgraced financier’s affairs. On Thursday, the British police arrested Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, over accusations that he shared confidential information with Mr. Epstein while serving as a British trade envoy. A former prime minister of Norway, Thorbjorn Jagland, was charged with “gross corruption” in connection with gifts, travel and loans he may have received from Mr. Epstein. The files show that Mr. Gates met Mr. Jagland, then the head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, through Mr. Epstein. To Mr. Epstein’s dismay, Mr. Gates cut off contact with him, a decision that Mr. Epstein attributed to the influence of Mr. Gates’s wife at the time, Melinda French Gates. Mr. Epstein discussed having Kathryn Ruemmler, a former Obama White House counsel, plead his case to Ms. French Gates. “She would love to sit with Melinda and give her the other side of jeffrey,” Mr. Epstein wrote in a 2017 text message included in the release. (Ms. French Gates did not speak with Ms. Ruemmler, a spokeswoman for Ms. French Gates said on Thursday.) Ms. Ruemmler recently resigned from Goldman Sachs, where she was the top legal officer, after messages emerged in which she advised Mr. Epstein on how to respond to questions about his sex crimes and addressed him as “sweetie” and “Uncle Jeffrey.” Ms. French Gates recently gave an emotional interview to NPR in which she said the latest release of files “brings back memories of some very, very painful times in my marriage.” Questions about what happened “are for those people, and for even my ex-husband,” she added. “They need to answer to those things, not me.” In an interview two weeks ago with an Australian television station, Mr. Gates said, as he had in the past, that he had met with Mr. Epstein to try to raise more money for philanthropy. “It’s factually true that I was only at dinners, you know I never went to the island, I never met any women,” Mr. Gates said, “and so the more that comes out the more clear it’ll be that although the time was a mistake it had nothing to do with that kind of behavior.” Mr. Gates has long been a popular figure in India, where his foundation has a significant presence. The India A.I. Impact Summit brought together important figures in the field as well as dignitaries like Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, President Emmanuel Macron of France and President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil. As recently as Tuesday, the foundation had confirmed Mr. Gates’s participation, saying on X that he was attending and delivering his address as scheduled.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Every tax season is a headache. Americans spend hours putting together their returns, a tedious chore that sometimes results in turning over even more money to the Internal Revenue Service. For many people, though, filing a tax return can be a financial lifeline. Tax refunds can help people catch up on bills, splurge on a vacation or simply pad their savings accounts. Those refunds are expected to be particularly significant this year. President Trump and the Republican Party passed a series of tax cuts last year that could make the average refund larger than ever. Among the changes are a new tax break for people 65 and older and the ability to deduct much more in state and local taxes. Republicans are hoping that Americans notice these tax cuts and, in return, support the G.O.P. in the fall’s midterm elections. I have spent much of the past year reporting on the creation of this tax law for The New York Times. Now I’m interested in hearing from readers about how, if at all, policies like a new tax break for overtime pay are shaping their finances. I also want to know how readers experience the tax system more generally. Have you been counting the days until you receive your tax refund? Have you been having trouble getting your tax questions answered by the I.R.S.? I’ll eagerly read every response to this questionnaire and reach back out to you if I’m interested in learning more about your situation. I won’t publish anything you submit without speaking to you. And I won’t share your contact information outside the Times newsroom or use it for any reason other than to get in touch with you. Andrew Duehren covers tax policy for The Times from Washington.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT President Trump has repeatedly promised that his steep tariffs would reduce U.S. imports, shrink the trade deficit and lead to a revival in American manufacturing. So far, the opposite has occurred. U.S. imports grew last year, and the trade deficit in goods hit a record high, data released Thursday showed, as Mr. Trump’s policies scrambled trade but did not halt it. That was consistent with other data suggesting that companies have rerouted orders and revamped supply chains to skirt tariffs but have not, so far, brought production back to the United States en masse. American manufacturers have cut more than 80,000 jobs in the past year. High tariffs and unpredictable policy drove huge swings in trade last year. Companies stockpiled products ahead of tariffs going into effect, then halted imports. American investors bought and sold large quantities of foreign gold as a hedge against volatile markets. But although hefty tariffs dampened purchases of imported cars, household consumer items and other goods somewhat, America’s trade with the world remained relatively robust. The United States imported chips to fill new artificial intelligence data centers and Americans snapped up foreign weight-loss drugs, all helping to buoy cross-border trade. The total trade deficit, including trade in both goods and services, shrank slightly last year, as growth in exports narrowly outpaced growth in imports. But that was entirely the result of an expanding trade surplus in services. The trade deficit in physical goods, which has been Mr. Trump’s focus as he has sought to use tariffs to restore the U.S. manufacturing sector, actually grew in 2025. Overall imports of goods and services increased 4.7 percent, to $4.3 trillion, in 2025, while exports rose 6.2 percent, to $3.4 trillion. The trade deficit — the amount by which imports exceed exports — was $901 billion, down from $903 billion in 2024. The trade deficit grew sharply at the end of the year, rising 32.6 percent in December as imports rose and exports fell. Tariffs did lead to drastic shifts in the countries with which the United States trades. Imports of goods from China tumbled nearly 30 percent, to their lowest level since 2009, as companies turned to factories in other parts of the world. But U.S. exports to China fell by nearly as much as the country — unlike many other U.S. trading partners — retaliated against Mr. Trump’s policies. The goods trade deficit with China shrank to $202 billion in 2025, the smallest in more than two decades and, for the first time on record, smaller than the deficit with the European Union. But as Americans bought less from China, they bought more from the rest of the world. Trade deficits with Vietnam, Mexico, India and other countries were the largest on record. The data has raised questions about whether Mr. Trump’s trade policy is restructuring the United States to be less dependent on imports, or mostly shuffling trade around. Mr. Trump has said steep tariffs and new trade deals will boost American factory production, making the country less dependent on foreign goods. Many importers have responded to tariffs and the threat of them by adjusting the timing of deliveries, and the countries from which they purchase, at great cost and inconvenience . Tariffs have also pushed up prices for American consumers, although by less than some economists initially feared. A study this month from economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that American businesses and consumers have borne most of the cost of the tariffs. U.S. exporters, particularly farmers, have also been caught in the crossfire of Mr. Trump’s trade wars. U.S. soybean exports fell sharply last year as China boycotted that crop and bought instead from Brazil and other countries as retaliation for Mr. Trump’s tariffs. American soybean farmers exported only $17.5 billion of their product in 2025, down from $25.8 billion in 2024. China stopped buying American farm products for most of last year until U.S. and Chinese officials agreed to a trade truce in late October. As part of that agreement, China pledged to buy 12 million metric tons of soybeans last year and 25 million metric tons in each of the next three years. The 25 million metric tons is in line with what China has bought in recent years. To help farmers deal with the fallout of the trade war, the Trump administration provided them with $12 billion in federal aid. But whether the policies lead to lower imports, higher exports and a narrower trade deficit in the long run still appears something of an open question. Bernard Yaros, the lead economist at Oxford Economics, said it was “a bit too early to tell what the lasting impacts of Trump’s trade policies are.” He said U.S. imports were now hovering below their trend from the decade before Mr. Trump’s second term. Part of that was payback for the huge spike in imports at the start of last year, and part was the impact of tariffs had on the relative price of imports rising. “We still need to see where imports settle once the ‘inventory effect’ from massive stockpiling in early 2025 wears off,” he added. After Mr. Trump’s election, companies had rushed to bring goods into the country before tariffs took effect, causing imports and the trade deficit to soar. Imports began to fall back after Mr. Trump announced global tariffs in April, including draconian levies on China. The president temporarily paused most of those tariffs to allow for trade negotiations, but reimposed them at lower levels in August. As of Jan. 19, U.S. consumers faced an overall average tariff rate of 16.9 percent, the highest since 1932, according to calculations by the Yale Budget Lab. The trade deficit briefly plunged in October, falling to the lowest monthly figure since June 2009. But much of that drop appeared to be the result of temporary fluctuations in trade, particularly in gold. The trade deficit rebounded somewhat in November before growing further in December. The president has long seen trade deficits as a sign of a weak U.S. economy, and argued that high tariffs would encourage more U.S. factory production and cause the trade deficit to fall. Many economists disagree with a single-minded focus on the metric, saying that the trade deficit can fall for many reasons, not all of them good. The tariffs have also shuffled U.S. trade with various countries. In particular, the trade deficit with China has shrunk, as companies rejiggered their supply chains in anticipation of higher tariffs on the country. But Brad Setser, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that American tariffs on Chinese exports had not ended up being that much higher than tariffs on goods from other parts of Asia, raising the question of whether companies would continue moving supply chains out of China. Mr. Setser said that the United States had also simply started importing more from elsewhere in Asia. The drop in the U.S. trade deficit with China was mostly offset by a big rise in the U.S. trade deficit with Vietnam, other countries in Southeast Asia, India and Taiwan last year. In some cases, shipments to the United States from elsewhere in Asia have still come from Chinese companies. Chinese firms have set up new factories outside of China to be able to export to the United States without paying the higher tariffs. China’s trade statistics show that, while its trade surplus with the United States has fallen, its trade surplus with the rest of the world has soared, Mr. Setser said. “The administration is trying to get far too much credit for shifting imports around a bit and moving to a world where Chinese content comes to the U.S. on a one-stop flight rather than on a nonstop,” he said. “The goods coming through Southeast Asia have enormously significant amounts of Chinese content.” Trade from Asia remained strong in part because Mr. Trump chose to exempt electronics from his tariffs last year.

We’ve been talking for months about potential problems in the private credit market.

Who will blink first? The U.S. has continued to build up its military presence in the Middle East, and The Times reports that President Trump is weighing possible strikes against Iran as soon as this weekend. The prospect of more military action — in one of the world’s most volatile regions — has markets on edge. The latest: Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, climbed above $71 a barrel on Thursday, a level it last reached in July. S&P 500 futures and stocks in Europe were down. President Trump has called on Tehran to give up its nuclear program, and stop enriching uranium. U.S. and Iranian officials have held indirect talks in Geneva, but some administration officials have grown skeptical that a breakthrough is achievable, and Israel has been making preparations for a possible war, The Times reports. Tehran has been more upbeat. Officials say they have reached a “ set of guiding principles ” with Washington after talks. Oil prices could surge if talks collapse , analysts say. Military action carries economic and political risks for Trump, threatening to reignite inflation. Trump campaigned on fighting inflation and lowering energy bills, and falling gasoline prices have been a rare bright spot amid a wider affordability crunch. But military intervention in a key route for global oil supplies and shipping could hit households hard. How high could prices go? A major attack on Iran could push oil prices to near $90 per barrel, Jorge León, a senior vice president and the head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy, an independent research firm, wrote to clients earlier this month. Others see more dire consequences. “It is our understanding that senior officials from the region had warned the White House that a war with Iran in the current environment could send prices to triple-digit levels,” Helima Croft, the head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, wrote to investors on Wednesday. Those officials are hoping that potential “calamitous outcome” would prompt Trump to “seek a Greenland-esque off-ramp,” she said, referring to his retreat from threats to seize the semiautonomous island from Denmark. Image HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING Walmart says that consumer price increases should slow down. The retail giant reported that sales in the fourth quarter grew 6 percent year-on-year, beating expectations, though it gave a weaker-than-anticipated financial forecast because of potential labor and trade challenges. John David Rainey, Walmart’s C.F.O., told CNBC that price increases partly spurred by President Trump’s tariffs should ease in the coming months , and that retailers had largely “absorbed” the brunt of their costs. Fed officials appear to be in no rush to cut rates. Minutes from the central bank’s meeting last month showed deep divisions among policymakers. Several support holding borrowing costs steady unless inflation cools further. Higher rates could be justified, too, if inflation remains above target. The minutes suggest that President Trump’s choice to succeed Jay Powell as Fed chair, Kevin Warsh, would face resistance if he tries to push for quick, substantial rate cuts, as the president has demanded. Trump reportedly intervenes in Moderna’s flu shot application. The F.D.A. has decided to reverse course and review the application for a seasonal flu vaccine — a move that came after Trump pressured the agency’s commissioner, Dr. Marty Makary, in a White House meeting , according to Politico. (A White House official denied the report.) Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, has been critical of the mRNA technology which the shot uses, and canceled $500 million in federal funding for mRNA vaccine development projects last year. Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor is arrested. Former Prince Andrew of Britain, who turns 66 on Thursday, was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of misconduct in public office after accusations that he shared confidential information with Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender, while serving as a British trade envoy. Several politicians and business officials who were in Epstein’s orbit have lost their jobs since the files were released, but arrests have been rare. Image “You’re mischaracterizing this” After more than a week of courtroom proceedings, the most anticipated witness in a landmark social media trial finally took the stand: Mark Zuckerberg. Over several hours, Zuckerberg, Meta’s C.E.O., faced tough questions about what his company knew about efforts to hook users on its apps — and repeatedly pushed back against accusations that its products are as addictive and harmful as substances like cigarettes. Zuckerberg was peppered with questions about Meta’s metrics. Lawyers for the plaintiff, a California woman identified as K.G.M., referred to internal documents about user engagement. Among them: In a 2015 email , Zuckerberg wrote that his goal for 2016 was to grow users’ time spent on the company’s platforms by 12 percent. Zuckerberg responded that while the company once focused on time spent, it doesn’t anymore “because I don’t think that’s the best way to do it.” Another internal document showed that in 2015, about four million children in the U.S. used Instagram — even though children under 13 aren’t allowed to create accounts. Zuckerberg said that the company removed any accounts held by underage users that it found and that its terms of service include age requirements. A lawyer for the plaintiff shot back, “You expect a 9-year-old to read all of the fine print.” Zuckerberg also faced questions about his control over Meta. A plaintiff’s lawyer asked the C.E.O. about his appearance on “The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast in which he said that, because of his voting power at the company, “I have the benefit of not having to convince the board not to fire me.” Elements of Zuckerberg’s defense included pushing back against claims by the plaintiff’s lawyers — “You’re mischaracterizing this” was a frequent rejoinder — and admissions that he wasn’t good at speaking publicly. (When asked if he had extensive media training, Zuckerberg joked, “I’m actually well-known to be sort of bad at this.”) The stakes are high for Zuckerberg and Meta. K.G.M.’s trial is one of thousands of cases filed against tech giants centered on the addictiveness of social media. By focusing on the structure of apps like Instagram, the plaintiffs are seeking to get around a longstanding legal shield that protects companies from liability for content users post on their platforms. (Several countries and U.S. states are also weighing bans on social media for teens, in many cases, for those under 15 or 16.) Worth noting: Judge Carolyn Kuhl ordered observers in the courtroom to remove smart glasses like those made by Meta to prevent them from potentially recording the proceedings. Neal Mohan, the head of YouTube, was scheduled to testify this week but was removed from the witness list. (Two other companies that were initially defendants in this lawsuit, Snap and TikTok, settled with K.G.M. for undisclosed terms.) “At a certain point, for some firms, it’s a publicity stunt.” — David L",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Earlier this month, President Trump found the latest pressure point to extend his leverage over Canada: a new bridge connecting the country to the United States that is expected to open this year. Mr. Trump threatened to block the opening, just hours after the billionaire owner of a competing U.S.-Canada bridge met with Howard Lutnick , Mr. Trump’s commerce secretary. It wasn’t that the president was particularly passionate about the new bridge. What excited him, officials familiar with his thinking said, was the opportunity to use the bridge to force Canada to make trade concessions. “I will not allow this bridge to open until the United States is fully compensated for everything we have given them, and also, importantly, Canada treats the United States with the Fairness and Respect that we deserve,” Mr. Trump said on social media on Feb. 9. The threat was a preview of the high-pressure tactics the president is expected to deploy when his administration renegotiates a trade deal with Canada and Mexico. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Mr. Trump signed into law during his first term, is set to be reviewed by the summer. U.S. officials have been raising pressure on Canada to get it to concede to their demands over trade and other issues. Mr. Trump’s threat to block the Detroit-to-Windsor bridge was the latest in a series of flash points that Mr. Trump has capitalized on to needle Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada. In October, Mr. Trump suspended trade talks over an advertisement featuring a historical address by President Ronald Reagan decrying tariffs , which was paid for by the Province of Ontario and aired in the United States. Mr. Carney apologized. The Trump administration has a list of things it wants Mr. Carney to concede, including longstanding grievances about protected industries in Canada, such as the dairy sector. Another pressing issue for the U.S. administration is the fact that liquor distributors controlled by Ontario and other provincial governments in Canada pulled U.S. liquor off their shelves last year, in retaliation against Mr. Trump’s tariffs on Canada. Trump administration officials have also been irked by Mr. Carney’s global charm offensive as he seeks to bolster Canada’s trade relationships with other countries, including China. Responding to a modest tariff deal that Mr. Carney struck during a visit to Beijing last month , Mr. Trump threatened to impose 100 percent tariffs on Canadian goods, and claimed that China would “take over” Canada and even ban hockey. He also responded bitterly to Mr. Carney’s speech in Davos , Switzerland, where he said that the era of a U.S.-led global order was over and that middle powers like Canada should band together to defend their interests. “Canada lives because of the United States,” Mr. Trump said the day after Mr. Carney’s Davos speech. “Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.” The spats haven’t resulted in new tariffs, but they form the acrimonious backdrop against which the two countries enter trade talks in earnest this year. The text of the U.S.M.C.A. says the review must be completed by July 2026. Mr. Trump and his advisers have indicated that the three-country pact could be scrapped altogether. Instead, the United States could end up with bilateral deals with Canada and Mexico, the advisers have suggested. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. That could be catastrophic for companies that have structured their business around the trade agreement. Trillions of dollars of trade happens under the pact, and leaving it could cause pain for American farmers and automakers and dent U.S. economic growth. Some trade experts and executives believe the idea of abandoning the North American trade deal is probably a pressure tactic from a president who has walked back from some of his biggest economic threats. But Mr. Trump has been dismissive when asked about the future of the agreement. “There’s no real advantage to it — it’s irrelevant,” he said in January. “Canada wants it. They need it.” Image The Trump administration has a list of things it wants Mark Carney, the prime minister of Canada, to concede. Credit... Ian Austen for The New York Times The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico despite the U.S.M.C.A. In Canada, those are hitting important pockets of the economy hard: Lumber, autos, steel and aluminum are particularly hurting. But the current arrangement does leave most of the U.S.-Canada trade tariff-free, as it does with Mexico. The president created major exemptions to his tariffs last year for goods that follow the rules of U.S.M.C.A. That has led to a rush of companies trading under the pact’s terms, and significantly brought down the average U.S. tariff rate. Data released on Thursday showed trade between the United States and Canada slowing in 2025. The trade deficit with Canada shrank to $46.4 billion in 2025 from $62 billion the prior year. But that was because both imports and exports fell as the United States bought less from Canada and sold less to its northern neighbor. In an interview with The New York Times in January , Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, said that the administration wanted to keep things in the agreement that were working, but that there was no “natural reason” that U.S.M.C.A. needed to be one pact. The United States would discuss energy production, corn sales and labor issues with Mexico, while the main issues with Canada included dairy, electricity transmission and digital regulation, he said. “We’re not wedded to any particular agreement or format of an agreement simply because it’s there,” Mr. Greer said. He said the administration’s priority was to bring manufacturing jobs to the United States, encourage wage growth and shrink the U.S. trade deficit . “The president’s been quite clear,” Mr. Greer said in a second interview this month. “He’s half inclined to leave. So we’ll see how that goes.” Mr. Greer helped negotiate and pass U.S.M.C.A. through Congress during Mr. Trump’s first term, as chief of staff to Robert E. Lighthizer, who was then the trade representative. But he is not afraid of changing the agreement, people close to him say. Mr. Greer last summer began urging a more disruptive approach to U.S.M.C.A. negotiations, saying its current form wasn’t working for the United States, one person who spoke with him said. One outcome of that approach could involve the president’s withdrawing from the agreement and replacing it with two separate deals, the person said. U.S. officials are unhappy with Canada’s continued protections for its dairy industry, among other issues. To keep talks on track last year, Mr. Carney dropped Canada’s planned digital services tax , which the United States had criticized, but the concession did not seem to advance talks. The U.S. administration has also criticized Mexico for welcoming investment from Chinese factories, which can then export their products to the United States under the preferential terms of the trade deal. The Canadian government is bracing for a rupture and weighing the financial and political costs of changing domestic policies that protect socially and economically sensitive industries, in exchange for a trade deal with the United States. Two Canadian officials involved in the U.S. trade discussions, who spoke anonymously to frankly convey their impressions of the state of the talks, said expectations in Ottawa for a full renewal of the U.S.M.C.A. were very low. Mr. Carney’s team, they said, even questions whether it could trust any fresh trade agreements with Mr. Trump. The Canadian government, they said, is preparing for long, bumpy and dramatic talks with a hostile U.S. administration, and even for a breakup of the U.S.M.C.A. Mr. Trump repeatedly said last year that he wanted Canada to become part of the United States — calling it the 51st state — and that he was ",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Officials at the Federal Reserve signaled no rush to restart interest rate cuts after pausing reductions last month , according to minutes from January’s meeting . In fact, several policymakers even went so far as to raise the possibility of rate increases if inflation stayed stubbornly high. The record of the latest gathering, released on Wednesday, underscored the sharp divisions that have plagued the central bank as it contends with a mixed economic picture after a series of rate reductions last year. Several policymakers indicated that there was still a path to lower rates this year if inflation declined as expected, while a larger group signaled support to hold rates steady until there was “clear indication that the progress of disinflation was firmly back on track.” The minutes showed that several policymakers wanted the Fed to convey “the possibility that upward adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate could be appropriate if inflation remains at above-target levels.” January’s meeting marked the first gathering since July at which the Fed held rates steady, voting 10-2 to maintain the previous 3.5 percent to 3.75 percent level. Two governors, Christopher J. Waller and Stephen I. Miran, dissented in favor of a quarter-point cut, arguing that the labor market was vulnerable without additional support from the central bank. The decision to pause came after three consecutive contentious meetings at which officials splintered over how to contend with a slowing labor market and intensifying inflationary pressures caused by President Trump’s tariffs . The Fed, prompted by growing concerns about rising unemployment, lowered rates between September and December by a cumulative 0.75 percentage point, although those decisions featured dissents in both directions. Some officials wanted the Fed to cut even faster, while others voted for the Fed to stay on hold. While January’s vote was not unanimous, it appeared less divisive than those earlier decisions. Officials appeared much more comfortable with maintaining the previous policy settings, citing a more upbeat economic backdrop, according to the minutes. The vast majority of officials concluded that the risks posed to the labor market had diminished and that consumer spending remained “resilient.” They broadly forecast “solid” growth in 2026. That echoed the message Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, sent at the news conference after last month’s meeting, at which he remarked on the resilience of the economy and noted that the jobs market appeared to be stabilizing. “The economy has once again surprised us with its strength, not for the first time,” Mr. Powell told reporters. In a separate exchange, he said that the Fed was “not trying to articulate a test for when to next cut, or whether to cut at the next meeting,” in reference to the central bank’s gathering on March 17-18. “We’re well positioned,” Mr. Powell said, stressing that the Fed would be making decisions meeting by meeting. When asked at the meeting, Mr. Powell said that rate increases were not “anybody’s base case.” Mr. Powell’s term as chair ends in May, giving him two more meetings at the helm. Mr. Powell could stay on as a member of the board of governors until 2028. He has not disclosed his plans yet. Mr. Trump said last month that Kevin M. Warsh, a former Fed governor, would replace Mr. Powell . If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Warsh’s first meeting as chair would be in June. Financial markets tracking expectations for rate cuts expect Mr. Warsh to usher in cuts but the timing has fluctuated after recent data showed the labor market steadying . Rate decisions are made by a 12-person policy-setting committee that includes all members of the board of governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a rotating set of four presidents from the other 11 regional banks. Officials have signaled that as long as the labor market stays intact, the bar for further cuts is high. Policymakers and economists across Wall Street expect relatively steady growth in 2026, raising some concerns that inflation will remain sticky even as many officials expect tariff-related price pressures to ease at some point this year. Recent research by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York suggested that, through November 2025, 90 percent of the economic burden of the president’s tariffs fell on U.S. companies and consumers. The study drew a sharp rebuke from Kevin A. Hassett, Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, who on Wednesday said it was the “worst paper I’ve ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve system,” and called for the authors to be “disciplined.” Mr. Hassett’s criticism is just the latest in a string of attacks on the central bank from the administration, which is seeking much lower rates than the Fed has so far been willing to deliver. One concern that Fed officials harbor is that cutting again too soon or by too much would undermine their grip on inflation. Most officials, according to the minutes, worried that progress in bringing down inflation “might be slower and more uneven than generally expected.” They also described the risk that inflation may persistently exceed the Fed’s 2 percent target as “meaningful.” Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index report, came in unexpectedly muted in January, according to data released last week. But estimates for the metric more closely watched by the Fed — the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index — point to a re-acceleration in the coming months that could push back expectations for the Fed’s next cut.

Haiyun Jiang/The New York Times Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 15:18 min Learn more Share full article By Ana Swanson Ana Swanson has written about international trade for over a decade. She reported from Washington. Feb. 16, 2026 On Jan. 26, 2025, Jamieson Greer was teaching Sunday school to a group of 9-year-olds when one of his phones started blowing up with calls from the White House. Six days into the new administration, President Trump was already deploying his favorite weapon: the threat of crippling tariffs to bend countries to his will. This time, the president was threatening Colombia, after it refused to accept U.S. military planes of deported immigrants. Mr. Greer would not join the Trump administration for some time yet, but he was already a key adviser on trade, flying to Mar-a-Lago in the weeks before to help plan Mr. Trump’s agenda. “Why do you have two phones?” a student asked him. “I have a kind of crazy job,” Mr. Greer replied. As the United States trade representative, Mr. Greer, 45, has been a powerful but behind-the-scenes force in transforming the global economy. His calm demeanor is often overshadowed in a cabinet filled with outspoken, brash billionaires. Yet few have done more in Mr. Trump’s second term to put into practice the president’s vision of altering the system governing how trillions of dollars of goods move around the world. Mr. Greer has provided the legal and policy framework to overhaul a global system Mr. Trump slams as unfair. He has helped the president raise tariffs to their highest levels in nearly a century while simultaneously leading negotiations with all of America’s biggest trading partners. So far, he has helped Mr. Trump reach initial trade arrangements with dozens of countries. Interviews with Mr. Greer make clear that he is a true believer in Mr. Trump’s plan to use tariffs to revitalize the United States manufacturing sector. He and other advisers have ushered in steep import taxes to try to protect manufacturers from foreign competition, coax more factories into the United States and create more good-paying factory jobs. “What the president has done is amazing,” Mr. Greer said in an interview in January. “He has restructured global trade.” It’s not yet clear those initiatives will work. Manufacturing employs less than 10 percent of Americans, and the number of factory workers has been dwindling. While some manufacturers support protectionism, others say it raises their costs and makes U.S. industry less competitive. Consumers are also concerned about tariffs increasing prices , and polls show Mr. Trump losing support for his handling of the economy. Though Mr. Greer credits the president’s tariff threats with giving him leverage in negotiations, Mr. Trump’s penchant for brinkmanship has clearly added uncertainty and complications to how countries deal with the United States. Mr. Trump has continued to threaten countries with tariffs, even if they have already agreed to trade deals, leaving companies unsure how permanent his policies are. This year seems likely to bring more tumult, as the Supreme Court reviews whether to overturn many of these tariffs. The administration is also preparing for high-stakes meetings with China, and negotiations with Canada and Mexico that could transform or dissolve the North American trade deal. Mr. Greer is often seen as a source of stability in the chaos. A former Mormon missionary and military lawyer, he has quietly navigated the demands of an unpredictable president, other big personalities in the cabinet, and the dozens of foreign leaders and company executives whose fortunes are tied up in trade. Friends say he has followed the advice of his mentor and former boss, Robert E. Lighthizer, who served as the U.S. trade representative in Mr. Trump’s first term: “You can get a lot done in Washington if you don’t care who gets the credit.” Mr. Greer’s small agency has only about 250 people, and he has not always been included in important administration decisions. In April, as he was testifying before Congress to defend the global tariffs Mr. Trump had just announced, the president surprised lawmakers and Mr. Greer by suddenly pausing them. But those close to Mr. Greer say he has built a solid relationship with the president. Mr. Trump has turned to him to coordinate issues beyond trade, like investment and security deals with Saudi Arabia, Cambodia and Thailand. Mr. Greer said that while he may not be a billionaire or political celebrity like other officials, he was chosen for a simple reason: “I know my brief.” Reading ‘Les Mis’ in Mortaritaville Image Mr. Greer during his time serving as a military lawyer in Iraq, where he was stationed at a base known as “Mortaritaville.” Credit... via the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative Mr. Greer is known as being preternaturally calm, a trait that some who know him say stems from being the father of five children. He credited his time as a military lawyer in Iraq, where he had to pause cross-examinations to shelter under a desk from mortar fire. “Listen, as long as nobody’s bombing me, I’m in good shape,” he said. Mr. Greer’s membership among Washington’s elite was not predictable. Raised in a working-class family in Paradise, Calif., he grew up in a mobile home, the fourth of five children, and worked during the summers and school year as a dishwasher and at McDonald’s. His parents valued education and Mr. Greer was drawn to the yellow-trimmed National Geographics that arrived in the mail each month. He attended Brigham Young University and served for two years during college as a Mormon missionary in Belgium, France and Luxembourg. In a white shirt and tie, Mr. Greer spent his days speaking to locals and refugees from Kosovo and Rwanda, an experience that opened his eyes to international relations and taught him fluent French that he still uses in trade negotiations. At B.Y.U., Mr. Greer joined the military and met his future wife, Marlo. After law school in Virginia and a stint studying in Paris, he served as a military lawyer in Kansas, Turkey and Iraq, where he was stationed at a base nicknamed “Mortaritaville,” reading “Les Misérables” in French between bombardments.

Credit... Rod Lamkey/Associated Press He was set on a path toward his future role as the architect of Mr. Trump’s trade strategy by what he called a “serendipitous” interview with Mr. Lighthizer for a job in Washington at the law firm Skadden Arps. Mr. Lighthizer said Mr. Greer impressed him as someone with “brains and values,” and hired Mr. Greer in 2012 to help the firm defend U.S. Steel and other American companies in trade cases. That work gave Mr. Greer an advance look at what U.S. industries would face in the coming years, as Chinese exports heavily subsidized by Beijing flooded global markets. Jeffrey Gerrish, who worked with Mr. Greer at Skadden Arps and at the trade representative’s office, said Mr. Greer was “right on the front lines” as Chinese goods began decimating U.S. industry. “He saw the kinds of impacts that it was having, not only on the companies, but on the workers and really entire communities,” Mr. Gerrish said. Mr. Greer saw the influx of cheap goods as a national security issue, but few Republicans or Democrats agreed. That changed with Mr. Trump’s election in 2016, when Mr. Lighthizer became U.S. trade representative and appointed Mr. Greer as his chief of s",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT For decades, Sandringham Estate has been a place for the House of Windsor to escape from it all. Three hours northeast of London, the palatial country house, its 20,000 sprawling acres and residences are where King Charles III and his family celebrate Christmas, waving to admirers as they parade to church services in their holiday best. Early Thursday morning, the idyllic estate was swarmed by unmarked police cars as officers arrested Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the king’s brother, amid allegations that he shared confidential government information with Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender. Later in the night, he would return to Sandringham, slinking low in the back seat of a black sport utility vehicle, with news cameras craning to capture his release. The scenes of Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor, already stripped of his title and kicked out of his longtime home, could be seen as an unmistakable message about the end of an era. Not since King Charles I was arrested and tried for treason nearly four centuries ago, in January 1649, has a British royal been detained. The king’s family, long rocked by scandalous infighting and grievous losses, is now facing what could be the gravest threat in more than a generation to its moral authority and the central role it plays, culturally and symbolically, in the country. The arrest represents the ultimate collision of police and pageantry, upending fierce efforts by Buckingham Palace to distance itself from the accusations against the former prince. The investigation into the former prince, which might continue for weeks or months, could rival royal weddings and coronations as one of the biggest public spectacles in modern British history. If charges are filed, by law and tradition, they will be formally brought in the king’s name: King Charles III v. his brother. Image At the royal family’s Sandringham Estate, in Norfolk, England, on Friday. A day before, the estate was swarmed by unmarked police cars. Credit... Justin Tallis/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The arrest follows years in which the king, and before him his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, stayed silent on separate accusations that Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor forced Virginia Giuffre to have sex with him after she was trafficked by Mr. Epstein when she was 17 years old. The former prince has denied those allegations and wrongdoing related to Mr. Epstein. “The royal family, far from dutifully serving the public in connection with this scandal that has enveloped Andrew, have not been transparent. They have not been forthcoming, secrets have persisted,” said Ed Owens, a historian and expert on Britain’s royal family. “It’s this lack of transparency that is the driving force of the moral problem at the heart of the mess for the monarchy.” The king tried on Thursday to address the simmering anger about his family’s handling of his brother’s case, issuing a statement addressed to the British people and signed simply “Charles R.,” the “R” referring to Rex, or king. In it, he vowed not to interfere in the country’s criminal justice system and pledged to assist in the investigation as needed. “What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities,” he said. “In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and cooperation.” Image On Thursday, King Charles III seemed eager to quickly move past his brother’s arrest, saying in his statement that “my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.“ Credit... Pool photo by Richard Pohle Across the globe — and especially in the United States — news of the former prince’s arrest underscored the striking lack of similar actions against people connected to Mr. Epstein despite the public disclosure of millions of pages of correspondence documenting his actions and communications with wealthy and connected elites. In the United States, only Ghislaine Maxwell, Mr. Epstein’s longtime associate, was convicted, of sex trafficking for conspiring to exploit underage girls. Mr. Epstein was arrested and charged, but died in prison while awaiting trial. After the former prince’s arrest on Thursday, a statement from the family of Ms. Giuffre, who killed herself last year, started with just two words: “At last.” And yet, the investigation into Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor does not focus on the accusations of sexual assault leveled against him during the past decade. Police are looking into whether Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor committed misconduct in public office while he served as a British trade envoy, amid reports that information was shared with Mr. Epstein. In Britain, the arrest felt like the culmination of a decade-long drama that has chipped away at the royal family’s stature, bit by bit. For years, the former prince’s links to Mr. Epstein plagued members of the royal family, even as they navigated the uncertainty of some of the most significant moments in British history. The death of Queen Elizabeth in 2022. The coronation of her son King Charles III. The very public defection of Harry, the Duke of Sussex, to the United States. The period of intense scrutiny began in 2010, when Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor was spotted walking with Mr. Epstein in New York, two years after the financier’s conviction for soliciting an underage girl for prostitution. The former prince later said he had arranged the meeting to end the friendship with Mr. Epstein and that he wanted do so in person. Correspondence from the recently released Epstein files in Washington show that he still maintained contact with Mr. Epstein. In 2011, a British newspaper published a now-infamous photo of Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor with his arm around Ms. Giuffre’s waist when she was 17. The scrutiny intensified when Ms. Giuffre alleged in a 2015 lawsuit that she was trafficked by Mr. Epstein and forced by Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor to have sex several times, in three different cities. Four years later, after Mr. Epstein was arrested and later died by suicide, Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor tried to reclaim his reputation. He sat for an interview on BBC’s Newsnight program , where he claimed he had no recollection of the photo with Ms. Giuffre. Image An undated image made available by the U.S. District Court of Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor with Virginia Giuffre, center, and Ghislaine Maxwell. Credit... U.S. District Court, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Nervous and evasive, the interview backfired. Viewers said they were shocked at his lack of sympathy for Ms. Giuffre and did not believe his denials of sexual misconduct. He tried to refute her allegation that they had sweated on a dance floor by claiming he was medically unable to perspire. In the fallout from the interview, the former prince agreed to step back from some royal duties and, in 2021, settled a lawsuit with Ms. Giuffre, the details of which were sealed. Even then, the royal family remained silent, keeping the royal status quo for Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor. He was finally stripped of his royal titles and royal residence last year, after Ms. Giuffre’s memoir revealed new details about her allegations. The latest release of Epstein files seemed to suddenly plunge him, and the royal family, into new territory, as the prospect of a criminal investigation into misconduct in public office emerged. On Thursday, King Charles seemed eager to quickly move past his brother’s arrest, saying in his statement that “my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.” Hours later, the king appeared in the front row of a London fashion show while his wife, Queen Camilla, attended a lunchtime orchestral concert. But the fallout is likely to continue for some time and could easily reach into the next royal generation, experts say. The king is receiving treatment for a cancer diagnosis and his heir, Prince William, said in his first comments on the case last week tha",

Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 9:52 min Learn more Share full article Photographs by Lynsey Addario Written by Sara Cincurova Feb. 20, 2026 Hundreds of Ukrainian women and girls have reported sexual violence by Russian troops during the nearly four years of full-scale war in Ukraine, according to Ukrainian authorities and aid groups. The actual number of victims, advocates say, is most likely far higher. Some of the women say they have been impregnated by Russian soldiers and live with children who will forever remind them of their attackers. Others have told of being forced to serve as sex slaves for entire companies of Russian troops. Still others say their life became a waking nightmare after they were incapacitated and raped by Russian forces. The New York Times spoke with more than a dozen women who said they had been sexually abused by Russian troops. Most of the women asked that their full identities be withheld to protect their privacy. Although details of their claims could not be independently verified, The Times reviewed criminal complaints and medical records related to many of their cases, and spoke with advocates familiar with the women’s accounts. Nina says she tested positive for hepatitis C after being beaten and raped by a Russian soldier in her home. Yuliia says Russian prison guards tied her naked to a table and threatened to violate her with a rubber stick after she was arrested in 2021 in a part of Ukraine occupied by Russia. Olha says she was stripped, groped and forced to use the toilet naked in front of Russian soldiers. The Kremlin has said that many reports by Ukrainian women of sexual violence were groundless. It did not respond to a request for comment. For Ukraine, the sexual violence is a largely hidden trauma. Advocates say many women are reluctant to file cases because they want to avoid stigma and painful memories, or because they live in territory that remains occupied by Russia and have little hope of legal redress. Some women have broken the cycle of silence, helped by survivor groups, or motivated to shed light on what they call atrocities that Russia has used as a weapon of war. Here are some of their stories. Lesya: ‘I thought that was it for me.’ Image Lesya beside her car in the Kyiv region. She said it was defaced by Russian soldiers after she was raped and her husband was killed. On March 7, 2022, two weeks into Russia’s invasion, Lesya, a 53-year-old economist, and her husband, Sasha, heard a knock on their door, in a village near Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. Two Russian soldiers burst in, she said. One of them caught her and dragged her into a neighbor’s house, she recalled. “He raped me straight away,” Lesya said. “The second one shot my husband in the stomach and leg while I was being raped.” Four other Russian soldiers approached the house where she was being violated, she said. “I thought that was it for me — they had knives, rifles and grenades,” Lesya recalled. But the soldiers stopped her attacker and pulled him away, she said. She then searched for her husband, she said. She found him bleeding on the floor of another house. Neighbors were attempting first aid. Lesya begged the Russian troops to allow her to drive her husband to the hospital, she said, but they would not let her get in her car. Sasha died in Lesya’s arms two days after he was shot, she said. One of his last utterances was “Thank God my father didn’t live to see this,” Lesya recalled, devastated at the memory. A doctor who investigated her husband’s death confirmed that he had died from gunshots to the abdomen during the Russian occupation. Lesya filed a complaint with the prosecutor general’s office accusing the Russian forces of rape, and criminal proceedings have begun. Her husband’s death, she said, was worse than the rape. She still lives in their house. Her car was stolen, then returned after Ukrainian soldiers pushed the Russian Army out of the Kyiv region. It had been marked with a “V,” a symbol Russia has used in the war. She has not driven it since. Svitlana: ‘I wanted to get an abortion.’ Image Svitlana holding her 2-year-old son, who she said was born out of rape by a Russian soldier. Svitlana, 31, was already worried about her 4-week-old son, who had been born in fragile health and had lost access to medical care after the Russian Army invaded her village in southern Ukraine. Then, Russian soldiers stormed her home and threatened to kidnap the boy and take him to Russia, she said. She intervened and they relented, she said. But even after that frightening encounter in March 2022, her partner, the baby’s father, began to befriend the troops. The father, a Russian sympathizer, invited them frequently into their home and drank with them, she said. One day, as the men gathered, her partner forced her into a white van with two soldiers, she said. The soldiers put a mask over her face, she said, and drove her to a nearby village. Svitlana’s partner stayed in the van while one of the soldiers forced her into a shop and raped her twice, she said. The soldiers “had a grenade, a knife and a rifle,” she recalled. Afterward, Svitlana’s partner accompanied her back to their house without saying a word, she said. Six months later, Svitlana fled to another village with her baby and four other children from previous relationships. She and her partner had split up. But Svitlana soon noticed that her stomach was growing. A pregnancy test came back positive. “I wanted to get an abortion,” she recalled. “I went to the hospital, but they said it was too late. I was 23 weeks pregnant.” Svitlana’s baby boy, Yaroslav, was born on March 8, 2023. The regional prosecutor’s office said that it was investigating the case and that it had received a report from a gynecologist who treated Svitlana. The child looks like the rapist, she said. She is seeing psychologists to help her come to terms with her situation. Today, “Yaroslav is developing faster than my other children. He already speaks fluently,” Svitlana said. “Sometimes, I regret that I wanted the abortion. I love him almost like the others.” Tetiana: ‘It was the worst of all the prisons.’ Image Tetiana Tipakova, who vocally opposed Russia’s invasion, said she was tortured by Russian soldiers for a week. When Russian troops occupied the city of Berdyansk in southeastern Ukraine on the night of Feb. 26, 2022, Tetiana Tipakova decided to resist. Ms. Tipakova, 53, a former student leader and an entrepreneur, wrapped herself in a Ukrainian flag and organized anti-Russian protests. She delivered speeches in front of City Hall and recorded videos for social media. Less than a month later, Ms. Tipakova said, Russian troops grabbed her inside her home. Eight armed men in balaclavas handcuffed her, put a bag over her head and drove her to a prison colony, she said. “I knew that place — it was the worst of all the prisons” in Berdyansk, she said. There, she was tortured for seven days, she said. On the fourth day, she said, she was driven to grounds outside the prison where guards had set up a mock execution by firing squad. While detained, Ms. Tipakova was subjected to psychologically and physically abusive interrogations, as well as beatings and electric shocks. After “the electric current ran through my body,” she said, she started “constantly smelling burning hair.” She said she was sexually assaulted by prison guards who violated her with their hands and with objects such as firearms. The goal of the torture, she said, was to break her mentally and to silence her, as well as to force her to spread Russian propaganda in Berdyansk. The abuse continued, she said, until she agreed to film a social media video acknowledging that anti-Russian protests were a mistake. She was released and then fle",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Cuba is confronting the United States’ first effective blockade since the Cuban Missile Crisis and running out of fuel fast, pushing the nation toward a humanitarian crisis and its government to the edge of collapse , according to a New York Times analysis of shipping data and satellite images. Cuban tankers have hardly left the island’s shores for months. Oil-rich allies have halted shipments or declined to come to the rescue. The U.S. military has seized ships that have supported Cuba . And in recent days, vessels roaming the Caribbean Sea in search of fuel for Cuba have come up empty or been intercepted by the U.S. authorities. Last week, a tanker linked to Cuba burned fuel for five days to get to the port in Curaçao but then left without cargo, according to ship-tracking data. Three days later, the U.S. Coast Guard intercepted a tanker full of Colombian fuel oil en route to Cuba that had gotten within 70 miles of the island, the data showed. While President Trump has pledged to halt any oil headed to Cuba, the Trump administration has stopped short of calling its policy a blockade. But it is functioning as one. Mr. Trump signed an executive order last month threatening to impose tariffs on countries that provide oil to Cuba. That has succeeded at scaring other nations, like Mexico , into sitting on the sidelines despite their desire to help Cuba. At the same time, the largest U.S. military presence in the Caribbean in decades is policing the waters around the island, fresh off its work blocking oil shipments to and from Venezuela ahead of the U.S. capture of the country’s leader, Nicolás Maduro, last month. And, according to a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters, the Coast Guard’s interception of the tanker headed to Cuba last week was part of a blockade that the Trump administration has not yet announced. “Among us longtime Cuba watchers, we’ve always resisted people using the word blockade,” said Fulton Armstrong, the former lead Latin America analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency, who has been studying Cuba since 1984. “But it is indeed a blockade.” The White House declined to comment. A Cuban government spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. The United Nations has criticized the U.S. policy as a violation of international law that has exacerbated the suffering of Cuba’s roughly 10 million residents. It also appears to have the island’s Communist government teetering on edge. Image A street in Havana earlier this week.

Yamil Lage/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images “Since the Cuban Missile Crisis, this is the biggest step,” Mr. Armstrong said, referring to the 13-day confrontation in 1962 when the U.S. Navy encircled Cuba . “And the Cubans will have to make a decision of whether to surrender.” The U.S. government called its 1962 policy a “quarantine” to avoid using the word “blockade ,” which legally could be interpreted as an act of war. The Trump administration has also avoided using the word “blockade.” President Miguel Díaz-Canel of Cuba has said he was open to negotiating with Washington, while promising to find ways around the blockade. “We are making every effort so that the country can once again have fuel,” he told reporters this month. “We have to do very hard, very creative and very intelligent work to overcome all these obstacles.” To understand whether fuel was still flowing to the island, The Times conducted interviews and analyzed satellite images, port records and data broadcast from a series of ships connected to Cuba. The analysis showed that oil-tanker traffic to and from the island has nearly stopped. Yet it also showed that several ships did appear to venture out in search of fuel. All were stymied by Mr. Trump’s policies. The Ocean Mariner On Jan. 29, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency, claiming that Cuba is a hotbed for spies and terrorists and threatening tariffs against any nation that provides petroleum products to the island. On the same day, a tanker called the Ocean Mariner docked at a port in Barranquilla, Colombia, according to data broadcast by the boat and satellite imagery. It loaded 84,579 barrels of fuel oil, according to Kpler, a shipping data firm. The Ocean Mariner has been a regular carrier of oil to Cuba, even delivering the island’s last shipment, from Mexico, on Jan. 9. But when it left Colombia, it broadcast its destination as the Dominican Republic. Twelve days later, on Feb. 10, it changed course toward Cuba. Jan. 15 Haiti Venezuela Colombia D.R. P.R. Florida Costa Rica Jamaica Panama Cuba Nicaragua Honduras Caribbean Sea Bahamas Leaves Cuba Loads oil in Colombia Loiters off the Dominican coast Heads to Cuba, turns around Being escorted to the Bahamas On Feb. 11, just 65 miles from Cuba, the Ocean Mariner abruptly made a U-turn, according to ship-tracking data. It appeared to have realized it was being pursued. The next day, a U.S. Coast Guard vessel pulled up alongside the tanker, according to the data. The Coast Guard crew asked the Ocean Mariner where it was headed, and the tanker reported it was destined for the Dominican Republic, despite the fact that it was way off course, according to a U.S. official who was briefed on the episode. The Coast Guard then sailed alongside the Ocean Mariner for nearly two days, escorting it into Dominican waters, the data show. The ship remained there, full of fuel, for several days. On Thursday, a Coast Guard vessel again began escorting the Ocean Mariner — this time north toward the Bahamas, which the Ocean Mariner broadcast as its destination. When U.S. vessels were seizing Venezuelan oil tankers late last year, those ships also brought their oil to the Bahamas. Growing Isolation In Cuba, people are struggling with frequent blackouts, shortages of gasoline and cooking gas and dwindling supplies of diesel that power the nation’s water pumps. Trash is piling up, food prices are soaring, schools are canceling classes and hospitals are suspending surgeries. Some humanitarian aid is still arriving in the country, including from the United States. The U.S. government said this month it would send $6 million in aid to Cuba, including prepackaged food, via the Catholic Church. Still, the U.S. embargo on Cuba has deeply complicated life for its residents for more than six decades, and now the blockade of oil tankers is plunging the island into one of its darkest moments. Jorge Piñón, a former oil executive who runs a team at the University of Texas at Austin tracking Cuba’s oil, said the team estimates that the country’s fuel reserves could be depleted by mid-March, triggering social unrest that could threaten the government. Nearly all of Cuba’s energy runs on oil and oil products . And Cuba appears to have few lifelines left . Its once dominant supplier, Venezuela, is now effectively controlled by the United States. Russia recently promised to send oil but its ships are nowhere to be seen. And other oil-exporting countries friendly to Cuba are staying away, Mr. Piñón said, including Brazil, Angola and Algeria. “All of these countries have their own problems,” he said. “Why antagonize the White House?” After Washington took control of Venezuela’s oil, Mexico was left as Cuba’s primary provider. But after Mr. Trump threatened tariffs, it halted its shipments. Mexico is economically dependent on the United States and locked in negotiations with Washington over an expiring trade deal . President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico has tried to walk a fine line, sending humanitarian aid packages to Cuba, offering to mediate talks and saying: “You cannot suffocate a people like this.” The Gas Exelero The Times analysis suggests that in the absence of its typical suppliers, Cuba has begun looking to some of its smaller neighbors in the Carib",

      "content": "The Chinese director Lou Ye, at his studio in Beijing in November. Credit... Andrea Verdelli for The New York Times Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 7:42 min Learn more Share full article 0 By Vivian Wang Vivian Wang interviewed Lou Ye, the director, at his studio in Beijing in late 2025. Feb. 20, 2026 Updated 2:20 a.m. ET At first glance, the Chinese director Lou Ye’s newest film looks like a departure from form. It does not touch on the taboo subjects, like China’s coronavirus lockdowns or the Tiananmen Square massacre, that earned him the moniker “the king of banned films.” It does not examine how ordinary Chinese respond to a changing society, the animating question of Mr. Lou’s oeuvre. There isn’t even dialogue, only music. It is a concert film about a Chinese rock band, ReTROS — Mr. Lou’s first foray into nonfiction after decades of feature films. For Mr. Lou, these differences are mostly semantic. “The distinction we draw between feature films and documentaries is a mistake,” Mr. Lou, 60, said in an interview at his studio in Beijing, not long after the film, “Re-TROS ‘After the Applause,’” made its premiere in the city last fall. “As long as there’s a camera pointed at you, reality has already subtly changed,” he said. A resistance to clear lines or categories runs through Mr. Lou’s work — and his life. His shaky, hand-held camerawork evokes realism, but the stories are often dreamlike or fantastical. The films start with real moments in Chinese history but feature mysterious look-alikes and stories within stories. He is best known for his clashes with Chinese censors, who have barred about half of his films from screening in the country. (He is sometimes compared to Jafar Panahi , the Iranian director who has been jailed for his films.) But Mr. Lou has also made movies released widely in Chinese theaters, featuring big budgets and even bigger stars, sometimes while battling censors on another film at the same time. Some Chinese filmmakers defy censorship early in their careers, then shift solidly into the mainstream; others remain on the fringes. Few have moved so continuously between the two. “Is that a good thing or a bad thing?” Mr. Lou said, when asked about that feat. Image Posters of the movies “Summer Palace” and “The Shadow Play” in Mr. Lou’s studio. Credit... Andrea Verdelli for The New York Times While his films have been honored at Cannes and Venice, he said he wanted most to reach a Chinese audience, who would be most likely to understand them. He has accepted significant cuts to some films to see them released domestically. (The concert film is awaiting approval for wider release.) Mr. Lou’s wife and frequent screenwriter, Ma Yingli, said in an interview that they tried not to think about censorship until submitting a movie for review. “If you do that, you’ll never be able to make a film,” she said. “If problems arise later, you can try to find solutions,” she added, such as cuts or edits. But some topics felt so urgent, Mr. Lou said, that he would not have been able to continue making films if he had not addressed them. That was true of “Summer Palace,” his 2006 film about disillusioned lovers after the Tiananmen massacre, because of his experience as a student during the demonstrations. It was also true of “ An Unfinished Film ,” a metafictional look at filmmaking under lockdown, because he felt the pandemic had redefined the relationship between people, screens and reality. Image Ma Yingli, Mr. Lou’s wife and frequent screenwriter, wearing the colorful scarf, speaking with Mr. Lou and other members of their team in his studio. Credit... Andrea Verdelli for The New York Times “Generally speaking, if you don’t violate an artist’s basic expression, I think restrictions and obstacles are quite normal,” he said. “But if you push past that point, the artist may push back.” He described this reaction as reflexive, out of his control. “That’s not about cinema anymore,” he said. Mr. Lou was born in Shanghai, to an actor and an acting teacher. At age 20, in 1985, he enrolled at the Beijing Film Academy to study directing. It was a time of heady experimentation, as China’s leaders loosened their grip on the economy and, cautiously, culture. The graduates from the academy in those years later became known as the pioneers of Chinese underground cinema. They made low-budget films documenting the unglamorous side of China’s boom and did not submit them to the state film administration, meaning they could not enter theaters. Mr. Lou’s breakout film was “Suzhou River” in 2000, a noirish tale of a man searching for his lost lover in a seedy, industrial Shanghai. It was Mr. Lou’s first encounter with international acclaim, winning a prize at the Rotterdam film festival, but also his first major run-in with the authorities. Because he had not obtained officials’ permission to submit the film to the festival, they banned him from making movies for two years. “Summer Palace,” the 2006 Tiananmen movie, earned him another five-year ban on filmmaking. He shot his next film, “Spring Fever,” in secret. A gay romance, it was released in 2009. In recent years, Mr. Lou has also made films marketed more at mass audiences, such as “ Saturday Fiction ,” a World War II spy story starring the Chinese superstar Gong Li. But even those films deploy techniques that may put off casual moviegoers, like jump cuts and subtle social commentary, said Sheldon Lu , a scholar of Chinese cinema at the University of California, Davis. Image Posters of “Suzhou River” and “Spring Fever,” other movies that Mr. Lou directed. Credit... Andrea Verdelli for The New York Times Many of Mr. Lou’s classmates at the Beijing Film Academy are now among China’s most successful directors, in part because they have embraced mainstream or even nationalistic filmmaking, such as odes to the Chinese military, Professor Lu said. But Mr. Lou “holds onto his principles, his aesthetics.” Indeed, after “Saturday Fiction” was widely promoted in Chinese state media, Mr. Lou again broached a Chinese government taboo: pandemic lockdowns, in “An Unfinished Film.” Released abroad in 2024, it is unavailable in China. Despite his maverick image, Mr. Lou is a restrained presence. A self-proclaimed introvert, he has worked with the same actors for many of his films, in part, he joked, because he is uncomfortable meeting new people. But he sometimes shows flashes of childlike delight — or defiance. While Mr. Lou was making “The Shadow Play,” a film about corruption during China’s economic opening, Ms. Ma shot a behind-the-scenes documentary. In one scene, Mr. Lou grins widely after capturing a shot he likes and mimics the sound of an explosion. But later in the documentary, when censors demand extensive cuts to “The Shadow Play,” Mr. Lou declares that he would rather it never be released. A member of his team fires back, “Do the rest of us eat?” After two years of negotiations with officials, the movie was released in China in 2019. At the premiere, Mr. Lou tersely told the audience that he had left in signs of deletions and changes, as proof of the censors’ interference: “These are all things I want the audience to be aware of.” Mr. Lou said “The Shadow Play” was probably the film on which he had made the most compromises. Still, he said it was worthwhile to give Chinese moviegoers a record of their collective experience, even if it could be only a “second-rate” version, as Mr. Lou once described it, because of censorship. His willingness to negotiate may also speak to his desire for audiences, both at home and overseas, to talk about something other than censorship.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT When a South Korean court sentenced a former president to life imprisonment this week, convicting him of masterminding an insurrection, it immediately removed one cloud hanging over the country’s current leader, Lee Jae Myung. Anything less than ​a conviction ​would have been a political disaster for Mr. Lee, who was a political opponent of his convicted predecessor, Yoon Suk Yeol. If Mr. Yoon had been cleared of​ the insurrection charge, he and his hard-right followers would have challenged the legitimacy of the impeachment — and by extension, ​Mr. Lee’s election, which it had made possible. Instead, the court’s ruling on Thursday lightens the ​political burden on Mr. Lee by justifying ​the impeachment​, which his party​ spearheaded. It also brings South Korea a sense of closure to the political turmoil and restores a measure of trust in the system.​​ Almost certainly, Mr. Lee will have a freer hand as he tries to move beyond the drama and toward other priorities. His party already has a majority in the National Assembly, the country’s parliament. ​About 60 percent of the South Koreans approve of his performance as president, according to surveys. If his party wins a landslide victory in the June elections of city mayors and provincial governors, as many analysts predict, it will make Mr. Lee more confident in pushing his domestic agenda, ​like curbing housing prices.​ But Mr. Lee’s toughest challenge remains how to heal the ​social fracture in his nation, deepened by political tribalism and differences over ties with North Korea and China, that was exposed by Mr. Yoon’s abrupt martial law declaration in December 2024. “Now that the legal judgment has come down on who’s right and wrong about Yoon’s martial law, it’s time for Lee to leave behind political strife and push more confidently for national unity,” said Kang Won-taek, a professor of political science at Seoul National University​. With or without Mr. Lee’s efforts, political polarization is still intense, fueled by hyper-partisanship, internet-generated disinformation and the rise of a far-right movement. Outside the courthouse on Thursday, rival camps shouted “death” for Mr. Yoon and “prison” for Mr. Lee. Image Supporters of former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol gathered outside the Seoul Central District Court on Thursday. Credit... Ahn Young-Joon/Associated Press Mr. Lee has vowed to heal the divided country and not to indulge in political revenge. But he also promised to “eliminate the insurrection forces,” whom his supporters cast as enemies of democracy. Mr. Yoon’s guilty verdict could dim the prospects for a small yet persistent army of Yoon supporters who have been rallying in downtown Seoul, calling for his reinstatement, however unrealistic that may be, some analysts said. But others warned it could aggravate the political polarization. In a message released to his followers through his lawyers on Friday, Mr. Yoon called himself a victim of “political revenge” and said, “Our fight is not over.” Jang Dong-hyeok, the leader of Mr. Yoon’s former bloc, the People Power Party, on Friday expressed “sadness” at Mr. Yoon’s conviction. He refused to cut ties with him or his followers, and it is still unclear what path the party will take in regards to Mr. Yoon’s outraged supporter base. “Yoon’s far-right followers will become angrier and more vindictive,” said Choi Jin, director of the Institute for Presidential Leadership in Seoul. “The People Power Party, in order to compensate for its weakened position, will likely escalate an all-consuming political offensive against President Lee.” Mr. Lee must reckon with the hard-liners within his own party, as well. They were angry that Mr. Yoon had escaped the death penalty they had demanded. And they vowed to enact a new law curtailing the president’s right to pardon criminals convicted of treason or insurrection — a potentially potent political tool that has fallen into Mr. Lee’s hands. Mr. Lee has been silent on Mr. Yoon’s conviction except for his call on the military on Friday to “eliminate the remnants of the illegal martial law,” a reference to officers who may have supported Mr. Yoon. Moving ahead, Mr. Lee is likely to push harder on his domestic agenda. He has sought punitive measures against news outlets for spreading what he characterizes as malicious falsehoods. He wants South Koreans to concentrate less of their wealth in real-estate and more in stocks, and wants to change real estate taxes to make homes more affordable, especially for the newly married. Mr. Lee’s government has also launched investigations into Protestant churches — long a powerful force in Korean politics, and a major source of support for his predecessor — to cut what he has condemned as corrupt ties between churches and politicians. Mr. Lee has proved pragmatic in negotiating a trade deal with the Trump administration and managing relations with his country’s neighbors, China and Japan. Despite repeated snubs from North Korea, he is trying to rebuild trust with the North, taking unilateral measures to ease tensions along the border. But the success of his policy endeavors will depend on whether he can learn lessons from Mr. Yoon’s downfall and appear as more of a uniter. “It’s the president who holds the key to building a cooperative relationship with the opposition,” Mr. Choi said.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The British police on Friday were searching a mansion occupied until recently by Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former prince, a day after his stunning arrest over links to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor was questioned until late Thursday at a police station in Norfolk over allegations of misconduct in public life. A photograph of him leaving the building, looking shellshocked in the back of a vehicle, dominated the front pages of British newspapers on Friday. The arrest plunged the British monarchy into one of its biggest crises in decades. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor, who turned 66 on Thursday, was formerly known as Prince Andrew and is a younger brother of King Charles III. His arrest came after the United States Department of Justice released millions of documents last month in connection with Mr. Epstein. Reports based on those documents suggest that Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor may have shared confidential government information with Mr. Epstein while serving as a British trade envoy, a position he held from 2001 to 2011. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor has not so far been charged. The British police did not mention the accusations of sexual abuse made against the former prince by Virginia Roberts Giuffre , who died by suicide last year, nor the trafficking allegations that Mr. Epstein was facing when he died in a Manhattan jail in 2019. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor, who has not spoken publicly or responded to requests for comment in recent months, has always denied any wrongdoing. Image Police officers at the entrance of Royal Lodge, a property on the estate surrounding Windsor Castle and a former residence of Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor, on Friday. Credit... Jaimi Joy/Reuters The police search underway on Friday was at Royal Lodge, a 30-room mansion on the estate surrounding Windsor Castle that the former prince occupied until earlier this year, when he moved to a smaller property on the royal estate in Sandringham, Norfolk. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor used an office in Buckingham Palace while working as a trade envoy, raising the possibility that it, too, might be subject to some form of police search. The British police have said nothing about the specifics of the investigation. Misconduct in public office takes place when someone performing a job on behalf of the British public “willfully neglects to perform their duty” or “willfully misconducts themselves” in abuse of the public trust. Theoretically, it carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. While other members of the royal family have continued their normal round of engagements, the allegations swirling around Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor have created an extraordinary moment of jeopardy for the monarchy, which has been shaken by several crises over the last century. Until Thursday, no senior royal family member had been arrested in connection with a serious crime since the 17th century. Charles issued a public statement after the arrest promising full cooperation with the investigation and stating that “the law must take its course.” On Thursday, Sky Roberts, Ms. Giuffre’s brother, praised the British authorities, contrasting what had taken place in Britain with what he described as inaction in the United States. “I will continue to commend the king for the actions he has taken, we have yet to see that from our own government here,” he said in a BBC interview. Amanda Roberts, Ms. Giuffre’s sister-in-law, added in that interview: “We are hopeful that this investigation now starts to open up that further probe into the sexual assault allegations.” Image Sky Roberts, the brother of Virginia Giuffre, and his wife Amanda, right, in Washington earlier this month. Credit... J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press In 2022, Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor paid Ms. Giuffre an undisclosed sum to settle a lawsuit in a New York court, in which she accused him of raping her when she was 17. He did not admit any wrongdoing in the case. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor was stripped of his royal title and honors last year after earlier revelations from the Epstein files. But he remains eighth in line to the throne and, while it seems unlikely that Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor could ever become king, some politicians are pressing for his right to succession to be revoked formally. That would require legislation in Parliament, a process that could expose the monarchy to more scrutiny. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor has said that he first met Mr. Epstein in 1999 through Ghislaine Maxwell, then the financier’s girlfriend and a well-connected Briton and daughter of the media tycoon Robert Maxwell. In 2008, Mr. Epstein was jailed after pleading guilty in Florida to a charge of soliciting a minor for prostitution. Two years later, Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor and Mr. Epstein were photographed walking in Central Park in New York City. The former prince later claimed that the meeting was to end the friendship and that he wanted to do so in person.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Almost as soon as an edict came out barring all female government employees in one Syrian province from wearing makeup, so too did the memes. They mocked the genetic curse of facial hair among Syrian women, saying they would now be indistinguishable from their male colleagues. Sultana Fawaz, a Syrian influencer, jokingly suggested that between the makeup ban and power cuts that have rendered women unable to style their hair, it was a plot by the government — led by conservative Muslims — to get women to cover their hair and faces. “Makeup is a red line,” Ms. Fawaz said with a chuckle in a video posted on social media. “Men should come out in protest, not women.” Joking aside, the decision by the governor of Latakia province struck fear among Syrians who are wary of the national government dominated by Islamist former rebels. Women in particular have wondered whether the central government would eventually try to institute religious laws in a country with a diverse array of religious and ethnic minorities. The Latakia governor, Muhammad Othman, decreed last month that female employees in state and local administrations and institutions in the province, including schools, should refrain from wearing makeup during official working hours or face “legal accountability.” Around the same time that the order came out, a local government in a suburb of the capital, Damascus, barred men from working in women’s shops — compounding the fears among some that the country would tilt in a more conservative direction. President Ahmed al-Sharaa has not done much to fan those fears. But there are concerns about the actions of individuals within the government, whether it’s changing school curriculums or security officers confiscating musical instruments or alcohol at the border. Mr. Othman, the Latakia governor, was appointed by the central government. Some have also questioned the timing and prioritization of seemingly trivial matters when Syria is still in the midst of tremendous political change, economic suffering and formidable security challenges. “Honestly, we really thought it was a joke because we’re not used to such a decision,” said Lina Ismael, 48, a media coordinator in the health department in Latakia, a province along Syria’s Mediterranean coast. Like others interviewed, she viewed makeup as a matter of personal freedom but favored reasonable limits on heavy makeup. Margarite Jamal, a lawyer in Latakia who spends much of her time at the courthouse, said she welcomed the decision, seeing it as an attempt to professionalize the appearance of civil sector employees. “Frankly, in the last 10 years, professional standards have declined significantly,” she said. “Many working women now go to work dressed the same way they would to a wedding, which is completely unacceptable and gives a baffling impression of working women.” A 41-year-old journalist who works for Syrian state television said she didn’t believe the decision when she first heard it. The woman, who asked not to be identified for fear of professional repercussions, said she herself sometimes wears makeup to work and other times will come with messy hair and an unwashed face, depending on her mood. She rejected the governor’s edict as a matter of personal freedom and a violation of women’s rights. After widespread condemnation of the decision, the journalist said she didn’t expect it to be strictly enforced. Weeks after the order was announced, several women interviewed said the ban was not yet being enforced. It remains unclear when or how it will be implemented and whether it will face legal challenges. Image Syrians protesting changes to the public-school curriculum in the capital, Damascus, last year. Credit... David Guttenfelder/The New York Times The Latakia governor declined repeated requests for an interview, but in a follow-up statement, his office sought to calm reaction to his decision. The edict “does not aim to restrict any group or infringe upon personal freedoms, which are safeguarded by the constitutional declaration and protected by law,” it said. The governor’s statement said the decision was about regulating professional appearance and avoiding excessive use of makeup in government and public sector jobs. There are a number of problems with the decision, said Dima Moussa, a lawyer, politician and feminist activist. For one, the law and constitution prohibit discrimination based on gender and the ban also infringes on personal freedoms, she said. More pressing for many Syrians was the political backdrop against which the decision was made. A ban on makeup is “viewed through the lens of the background of those making these decisions,” Ms. Moussa said. “Until now there is nothing that shows that their intent is to make the country Islamic,” she said of the government. “But there is always fear,” she added. “The good thing is that when decisions like this are made, the reaction, time and again, shows them that the Syrian people don’t accept this,” Ms. Moussa said. Even though Syrians generally are socially conservative, no matter their religion, they still reject such restrictions, she added. “People don’t want anyone to restrict their freedoms, tell them what to wear or not to wear, tell them how they should look, tell them if they can drink alcohol or not,” she said.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Japan’s shopping districts, restaurants, temples and ski resorts would normally be teeming with Chinese tourists right now as they celebrate the Lunar New Year holiday. Instead, in cities like Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto, business owners say visitors from China have been scarcer this year. The Chinese government, drawing on falsehoods and exaggerations, is aggressively discouraging its citizens from visiting Japan as part of a campaign to punish Tokyo for its support for Taiwan , a self-governing democracy that Beijing considers part of its territory. In recent government statements and state media commentaries , Beijing has portrayed Japan as a land where people live under the constant threat of earthquakes, crime, traffic accidents and attacks by bears — and where Chinese travelers, in particular, are targeted. “Chinese citizens face serious security threats in Japan,” China’s foreign ministry said ahead of this week’s Lunar New Year holiday, China’s peak travel season. Beijing’s strategy of undermining Japan’s image in China as one of the world’s safest travel destinations may be working. The number of Chinese travelers to Japan has sharply declined in recent months, falling 61 percent in January from a year earlier (though the data is somewhat skewed by the timing of the Lunar New Year, which began in January last year and in February this year). Arrivals had fallen 45 percent in December. Here’s a look at Beijing’s claims. Earthquakes China has repeatedly pointed to the frequency of earthquakes in Japan to deter travel there. In December, after a powerful earthquake in northern Japan, the Chinese foreign ministry said people should avoid the country because of the risk of a tsunami or a so-called mega quake. Yes, Japan sits along the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” a chain of seismologically active faults encircling the Pacific Ocean, making it one of the world’s most earthquake-prone countries. But Japan is also a global leader in dealing with earthquakes, with early warning systems and strict construction standards. By seizing on earthquakes, analysts said, the Chinese government is attempting to signal that its central concern is safety — not politics. In these warnings, the government rarely mentions its fierce opposition to Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s stance that Japan could help defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion. “A safety narrative feels more neutral and reversible, giving the Chinese government room to signal displeasure while keeping diplomatic flexibility,” said Xiao Qiang, a specialist in Chinese propaganda at the University of California, Berkeley. Targeting of Chinese Citizens China has argued that its citizens risk being targeted in Japan, tapping into a longstanding nationalist narrative rooted in the two countries’ bitter World War II history and Japan’s record of wartime atrocities . China has highlighted attacks on its citizens, including an incident reported by Japanese media this week in which a man attacked a Hong Kong resident on the head with a beer bottle in the northern city of Sapporo. China has also said, without providing specifics, that there have been cases of “unprovoked verbal abuse and physical assault” against its citizens in Japan. There is no evidence of a surge in crime or discrimination against Chinese citizens in Japan. In fact, the number of murders, robberies and arsons involving Chinese victims has declined over the past several years, according to official Japanese statistics. China’s attempts to heighten a sense of prejudice might resonate domestically because of the emotions people still feel about World War II, said Kurt Tong, a managing partner at the Asia Group and former American diplomat. “These emotional, interpersonal arguments could have more resonance with the Chinese public,” he said. “It plays into the nationalist idea that they’re being disrespected as a people.” Crime, Accidents and Bears Japan has one of the lowest crime rates in the world. But you wouldn’t know that by reading Chinese media reports. Beijing has seized on random incidents of violence in Japan as evidence of a broader safety problem, pointing, for example, to the stabbing of three teenagers this month in Osaka. “The security environment in some areas of Japan has been unstable, and similar vicious cases have been occurring frequently,” the Chinese consulate in Osaka said in a statement that warned citizens against traveling to Japan. China has also suggested that Japan has a road safety problem, even though traffic fatalities are relatively low in the country. Last month, the Chinese authorities highlighted an incident in which a car rammed into pedestrians along a street in Tokyo’s popular Shinjuku neighborhood. Beijing said that two Chinese nationals were seriously injured. The Chinese embassy in Japan even issued a warning about a record surge in bear attacks in the country. Experts said that Beijing would have to work hard to convince the public to forgo trips to Japan, given the love in the mainland for Japanese food, culture and products. “They’re reaching for the stuff they think might get people’s attention,” Mr. Tong said. “But Japan is such an attractive place to visit. In the long term, they might not be able to keep people away.” Kiuko Notoya and Hisako Ueno contributed reporting from Tokyo and Chris Buckley from Taipei. Javier C.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT It was a recent late night in the VIP Club, the hedonistic heart of Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy’s most ski-and-be-seen winter destination. An Olympic security manager watched from the bar as scions of wealthy families, men in expensive sweaters and women in backless leotards sang along with the piano player to Lionel Richie’s “All Night Long (All Night).” Others kicked back with champagne and admired the view of the Olympic sliding track, winding like a glow worm through the Cortina night. The Winter Olympics, much of which are based in Cortina, have shined a light on the natural beauty of its surrounding landscape, a valley bathed in sunshine and wrapped by the craggy Dolomite mountains. But Cortina’s beautiful people hope the Games can also revive Cortina’s long-held reputation for glamour, which has waned in recent generations. “We have the opportunity to show the world how Cortina is beautiful in a different way , ” said Manuel D’Avanzo, the owner of the VIP Club, which he called “a holy grail” for wealthy, night-life loving Italians. It is a place, he said, with heritage and history — and now a sponsorship deal with Rolls-Royce. At least one sliding-sport athlete admitted to slipping out with teammates to party at the club during the Games, though he was granted anonymity when he pleaded that without it, he would be thrown off the team. (“Our coach will kill us,” he said.) Mr. D’Avanzo agreed that it was more prudent for athletes to come after they won their competitions, “not before.” Image Placing trees around the Olympic rings in Cortina in early February.

James Hill for The New York Times Cortina, once a small village of shepherds and farmers, has long served as a winter playground of the Italian upper class. Carriages ferried aristocrats to their Cortina villas in the 19th century. In the 1920s, Ernest Hemingway boozed here, calling the area “the swellest” place on earth. The 1956 Olympics, which the town hosted, “internationalized Cortina,” according to its current mayor, Gianluca Lorenzi. In the 1960s, Hollywood nobility flocked here along with “all of the Dolce Vita,” he said, referring to the stars of the golden age of Italian cinema. They kept coming through the 1980s, when libidinous Christmas comedies named after Panettone cakes were set here and immortalized the town in the broader Italian imagination. Cortina lost its luster in recent decades, and the Olympics helped bring new investment, hotels and luxury. “So we can say the jet set also welcomed us hosting the Olympics,” Mr. Lorenzi said. Since the Olympics started, the fashionable crowd in fox and mink coats have been outnumbered by fans wearing bright wigs, puffer jackets branded with national flags, and the odd dinosaur outfit. But the Games have shown that the pursuits of athletic excellence and decadent indulgence can coexist.

Alessandro Grassani for The New York Times During the opening ceremonies, as national delegations began parading in alphabetical order down the town’s main drag at 8:42 p.m., the leading figures in Cortina had gathered around televisions farther down the street, at the Hôtel de la Poste. They managed to sit still until about the letter M. “At 9:30, we start the music again,” the DJ announced to a cheer. “Or even earlier.” “If I wanted to watch TV, I would have stayed home,” one woman said as the music started back up and she and other middle-aged patrons began to dance vigorously at the screens. Gherardo Manaigo, the sixth-generation owner of Hôtel de la Poste, went around shaking hands. He had grown up with stories of the wonderful Olympic atmosphere. “Now it’s our time,” he said as Filippo Borghi, La Poste’s famous bartender, made signature cocktails.

Alessandro Grassani for The New York Times Throughout the Games, helicopters have brought the superrich to a helipad near the 1956 Olympic ski-jump venue. In the years after those games, fatal crashes led to the closure of a small airport and to the end of plane travel to Cortina. “We don’t want the airport,” Mr. Lorenzi said, speaking for the nay side of the debate over a possible airport, though he did see a near future in which the jet set could be replaced by the drone set . Aviation officials, he said, had told him that “the first drone” carrying up to 18 people to the mountains would arrive by 2030. In the meantime, jet setters have to schlep along winding roads, but some said they appreciated the drive, that it sealed them off from the demands of the real world. In the days before the Games began, a group of elegantly tailored Italians who lived and worked in Miami, New York and London gathered to celebrate the anniversary of a previous bash they had held on sailboats in Bodrum, Turkey. The idea, said Federico Pellegrini, 35, a Miami-based fashion executive, was for all the invitees to bring a friend so that they could “assess if they are eligible for the good vibes,” he said. Image The VIP Club in Cortina last month. “We have the opportunity to show the world how Cortina is beautiful in a different way,” Manuel D’Avanzo, the owner, said. Credit... Alessandro Grassani for The New York Times Mr. Pellegrini’s friends, mostly Cortina veterans dressed in exquisite fabrics, fur coats and hats, talked about how taking it easy was actually quite difficult. “An intense job. You get up at 7:30 to ski,” said Pier Alberto Patergnani, 32, an Italian who works for an artificial-intelligence company in London. Then, he said there was lunch, après-ski, “town,” happy hour, dinner and finally clubbing. The Olympics had injected more life into Cortina, he said, and his friends from the boating trip could feel it. They wore short fur coats over short shorts and spoke excitedly about catching a glimpse of an Italian athlete training on the slopes. Mr. Patergnani’s group often ended up at the VIP Club, where Francesco Bernardin, the 55-year-old piano player, explained the tastes of Qataris, Americans and Russians “who love Abba.” Tamara Khermayer, a longtime VIP patron, took a break from singing her heart out to sip a gin fizz at a bar built from an 18th-century pharmacy counter. She said that Cortina, unlike St. Moritz and other fancy locales, had a more intimate feeling. “It’s an expensive home,” she said, “but it’s still home.” Image Some hope the Games can revive Cortina’s long-held reputation for glamour. Credit... Alessandro Grassani for The New York Times During the Games, the VIP Club has had unlikely competition from the Corona Zero Green Room, a lounge with nonalcoholic beer in the Olympic Village, where the athletes are staying a short bus ride from town. Despite their apparent sobriety, the athletes “are flirting a bit,” said Nena Dekker, a bartender at the green room. Competitors from Liechtenstein had handed her “paper with their number on it,” she said. The top athletes, though, seemed to have other things on their minds. Hitting Cortina’s party scene was not on the agenda, the Italian skier Federica Brignone said shortly after winning the gold medal in the super-G downhill race. “I haven’t eaten from 6:45 in the morning and my legs need treatment, so no,” Ms. Brignone said. Instead, she would spend time with her family: “I will celebrate after the Olympics.” Jason Horowitz is the Madrid bureau chief for The Times, covering Spain, Portugal and the way people live throughout Europe.

Vincent Alban/The New York Times Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 7:22 min Learn more Share full article 10 By Motoko Rich Reporting from Milan Feb. 20, 2026 The Italian speedskater Francesca Lollobrigida had just won a gold medal and set an Olympic record — on her 35th birthday, no less — but her toddler son Tommaso stole the limelight. Ms. Lollobrigida, holding her 2-year-old son in her arms with her gold medal slung around his neck, answered questions from reporters while Tommaso, bleating “Mamma,” grabbed her nose, batted a broadcaster’s microphone, and ripped the Team Italy headband off her head. “Wait one second, love,” Ms. Lollobrigida said, never breaking her composure. The reaction to Ms. Lollobrigida’s breakout moment revealed the complicated landscape for Italian women who want to balance their professional and family lives. While medal-winning Italian men who celebrated with their children attracted little attention, Ms. Lollobrigida’s multitasking went viral. Several Italian newspapers ran front page photos of her holding Tommaso, under headlines playing on the word “Mamma.” Giorgia Meloni, Italy’s first female prime minister and also a mother, joined a largely supportive chorus by praising Ms. Lollobrigida’s “ Italian pride, talent, and determination .” Amid the support, there was still plenty of criticism. Scoffing at Tommaso’s naughty behavior that threw shade at Ms. Lollobrigida’s parenting skills. Jibes at her husband for not taking control and removing his son from the scene. Even the positive reaction expressed an implicit surprise at a female champion who was also a successful parent. “In Italy we still have the meaning that the man needs to work and the woman needs to stay home, you know?” Ms. Lollobrigida said in an interview with The New York Times. Image Ms. Lollobrigida, celebrating gold with her 2-year-old son Tommaso. Credit... Luca Bruno/Associated Press Ms. Lollobrigida’s multitasking with her child might have felt familiar to working mothers anywhere. The reaction to it was one of several moments in the Games that showed the challenges still faced in particular by Italy’s sportswomen, who have achieved growing success and publicity at these Olympics while never shaking the chauvinism of their society. After the Italian skier Federica Brignone won the first of two gold medals in Cortina earlier this month, her father, Daniele Brignone, told a reporter he hoped she would quit skiing and “stay home and give me two beautiful grandchildren.” A piece in Il Sole 24 Ore, Italy’s main business newspaper, described the women of Italy’s Olympic delegation — many of them in their mid 30s — as “irresistible girls” who won while “the biological clock goes faster than they do.” Unlike Ms. Lollobrigida, most Italian female athletes retire before having children, said Francesca Vitali, an assistant professor in sports sciences at the University of Verona. “The perception is, if you are an athlete, probably you are not so good of a mother,” Ms. Vitali said. In Italy, a lower proportion of women work than in most other European countries and earn nearly 40 percent less on average than men. Meanwhile, the birthrate has fallen to one of the lowest in Europe — in part, experts say, because of the lack of support for working mothers. While Italy has traditionally been a family-focused culture, some of the backlash against Ms. Lollobrigida’s son during her gold medal interviews may reflect a declining tolerance for children in public places, said Letizia Mencarini, a demographer at Bocconi University in Milan. As births have declined, “we are not used to seeing children anymore,” Ms. Mencarini said. Image Ms. Lollobrigida came to sport early. By the time she was 14 months old, she was on roller blades, and as a teenager, she won national, and then international, championships. Credit... Vincent Alban/The New York Times Ms. Lollobrigida said in the interview with the Times that she hoped to challenge some of these trends. “I want to show that it’s possible” to combine professional achievement with motherhood, she said this week following practice in Milan, four days after she had won her second gold medal . Ms. Lollobrigida came to sport early. The eldest of two daughters, she grew up outside Rome with their father, Maurizio, a onetime rollerskating champion and swim coach, and mother, Sondra Bergamini, a physical education teacher. By the time she was 14 months old, Ms. Lollobrigida was on roller skates. By the time she was 3, she was on inline skates. As a teenager, she won national, and then international, championships. “I’ve known many boys and girls who were even better, maybe, than Francesca, but didn’t have the patience and the perseverance to keep at it,” said her father, Mr. Lollobrigida, 64. She sacrificed school trips and parties to train, often driving hours on a Friday night to get to an ice rink in the north of Italy. When classmates teased her about her legs being too big and powerful for a girl, she persisted. During the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Ms. Lollobrigida began to harbor her own Olympic ambitions. She reached out to Maurizio Marchetto, Italy’s national speed skating coach, and asked if he would help her transition from wheels to blades. She often practiced with men, but highlighted her femininity with pink stripes on her skates or manicures in bright colors. (She won her first two gold medals in Milan sporting bold green nails.)

Vincent Alban/The New York Times At the Winter Games in Sochi in 2014, she placed 23rd in the 3,000 meters. Eight years later at the Beijing Games, she finally won Olympics bronze and silver medals. After Beijing, she told her coach that she and her husband, Matteo Angeletti — who she met on the inline skating circuit — wanted to start a family. She figured that if she gave birth within a year, she could take leave and retrain in time to compete in the next Winter Olympics in her home country. “She was good at choosing her timing,” said Mr. Marchetto, her coach. As soon as she told her parents she was pregnant, her father said, he scoured the internet for studies on women who had returned to elite sports after childbirth. Ms. Lollobrigida modified her workout during her pregnancy . When Tommaso was 4 months old, Ms. Lollobrigida returned to full-time training. She wanted to continue to breastfeed, so Italy’s ice sports federation paid for her mother and sister to join her to care for the baby while she was away from her home outside Rome. Because Italy does not have a permanent indoor skating oval, the athletes travel as much as 250 days a year to train and compete in other countries. “We sports people have to be an example,” said Andrea Gios, president of the federation. He said he hoped the success of athletes like Ms. Lollobrigida would “spread in our country a different culture” of support for working parents.

Mr. Angeletti is not fazed. “I knew what I was getting myself into,” he said during an online interview with Tommaso playing with a toy helicopter in the background. The couple had Tommaso on skates before his first birthday. Lately, though, “he says ‘no’ because he associates the skates with when I’m away,” Ms. Lollobrigida said.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, once regarded as a dashing war hero and the favorite son of Queen Elizabeth II, was arrested by the British police on Thursday amid widening scrutiny over his ties to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest, on suspicion of misconduct in public office, was a staggering blow to the British monarchy and the latest chapter in his downfall, coming months after his connections to Mr. Epstein led Buckingham Palace to strip him of his royal titles and evict from his royal residence. The police did not provide any details of the investigation. But the arrest of Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor, the younger brother of King Charles III who was formerly known as Prince Andrew, came after reports suggested that he may have shared confidential information with Mr. Epstein while serving as a British trade envoy, a position he held from 2001 to 2011. Video Former Prince Andrew Released After Arrest by British Police The British authorities released Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor after arresting him on suspicion of misconduct in public office following the latest release of documents linked to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Credit Credit... Kirsty Wigglesworth/Associated Press The police did not mention the accusations of sexual abuse that have shadowed Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor, 66, or the trafficking allegations that Mr. Epstein was facing when he died by suicide in a Manhattan jail in 2019. In a remarkable written statement addressed directly to the British public, Charles said he had learned of his brother’s arrest “with the deepest concern.” “What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities,” Charles wrote. “In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and cooperation.” He concluded his statement with a note of determination. “Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all,” Charles wrote. He later attended an event for London Fashion Week and his wife, Queen Camilla, went to a lunchtime orchestral concert in the city. Image King Charles III attending a Tolu Coker fashion show during London Fashion Week 2026 on Thursday. Credit... Simbarashe Cha/The New York Times The arrest was without precedent in modern British history. The last senior member of the royal family to be arrested in connection with a serious crime was King Charles I, who was executed for treason nearly four centuries ago, on Jan. 30, 1649. The arrest of Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor, who was released after around 11 hours in custody, escalated the crisis confronting the British crown amid deepening revelations of his connections to Mr. Epstein and allegations that he sexually abused a young woman trafficked to him by the American. The former prince has denied that he raped the woman, Virginia Roberts Giuffre. A British anti-monarchy group, Republic, said it had reported evidence of potential misconduct in public office to the Thames Valley Police, the police force west of London that is leading the investigation. Gordon Brown, who was the British prime minister when Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor was a government trade envoy, issued a statement on Thursday saying that he had provided additional information about Mr. Epstein to the Thames Valley Police ahead of Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest. The Thames Valley Police, citing national guidelines, did not identify the man they had arrested, but confirmed that they had taken “a man in his sixties from Norfolk” into custody at about 8 a.m. and were carrying out searches at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk. The police were seen in Norfolk on Thursday morning at the Sandringham Estate, the private, 20,000-acre country retreat of Charles and Camilla, where Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor has been living since he was evicted earlier this year from the Royal Lodge, his residence in Windsor. Image Members of the media near Royal Lodge, Andrew’s former home, in Windsor on Thursday. Credit... Jaimi Joy/Reuters The police later confirmed that the man they had arrested was “released under investigation,” a designation that indicated that the investigation was not over. Photos shared by the BBC showed Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor in the back seat of a car appearing to leave a police station where he had been held. Under British law, the police generally cannot hold suspects for more than 24 hours without charging them. In the British legal system, the investigation could continue with charges filed at a later date. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor’s representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. According to the guidance provided to British prosecutors, misconduct in public office is committed when a public officer “willfully neglects to perform their duty” or “willfully misconducts themselves” in abuse of the public trust. No case has ever tested whether a member of the royal family could be considered a public officer, but Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor, in addition to serving as a government trade envoy, was a helicopter pilot for the Royal Navy during the war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands in 1982. He met Mr. Epstein in the late 1990s through Ghislaine Maxwell, then the financier’s girlfriend and the daughter of the British media magnate Robert Maxwell. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor told the BBC in 2019 that the friendship was valuable, partly because of the networking opportunities it offered. Ms. Giuffre had accused Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell of recruiting her for sexual abuse under the guise of becoming a professional masseuse. In 2022, Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor paid Ms. Giuffre an undisclosed sum to settle a lawsuit in a New York court that accused him of raping her when she was 17. He did not admit any wrongdoing in the case. Ms. Giuffre died by suicide last year. On Thursday, her family welcomed Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest. “At last,” the family said. “Today, our broken hearts have been lifted at the news that no one is above the law, not even royalty.” Image A widely published photograph showing Andrew, then still a prince, and Virginia Giuffre.

US District Court — Southern District of New York That view was echoed by David Lammy, Britain’s deputy prime minister and justice secretary, who told the BBC that “nobody in this country is above the law” and that the investigation “must happen in the usual way.” The arrest underscored a striking contrast in the official responses to the Epstein files, which have tainted the reputations of powerful figures in business, academia, entertainment and politics. The British authorities have moved aggressively to investigate the possibility of crimes emerging from the documents, while the police in the United States have not. President Trump, discussing the arrest with reporters, said: “I think it’s a shame. I think it’s very sad. I think it’s so bad for the royal family.” In Britain, the police are also investigating whether Peter Mandelson , a longtime British political operative who served as ambassador to the United States, committed misconduct in public office by sharing sensitive government documents with Mr. Epstein. He has denied any criminal wrongdoing. The files also revealed that Sarah Ferguson, Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor’s ex-wife and the onetime Duchess of York, carried on a long and personal correspondence with Mr. Epstein long after he was convicted of soliciting prostitution in 2008.

The New York Times Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 8:01 min Learn more Share full article 15 By Max Bearak Annie Correal Patricia Sulbarán Isayen Herrera and Genevieve Glatsky The reporters have been covering the aftermath of the U.S. military’s removal of President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela. Isayen Herrera reported from Caracas, Venezuela. Feb. 19, 2026 Venezuelan lawmakers passed a wide-ranging amnesty bill on Thursday that could free hundreds of political prisoners, in perhaps the strongest indication yet that the interim government, under pressure from the United States, is moving to ease some of the regime’s most repressive tactics. But some experts and activists for political prisoners say the amnesty measure, while long overdue, leaves out many people held by the state and relies on a compromised judiciary system to carry out the law. Even some of its supporters have called it imperfect. The law applies to the years in power of the ruling government, starting in 1999, the first year in office of former President Hugo Chávez, a self-described socialist and charismatic strongman leader who put in place the current regime before his death in 2013. The amnesty law, however, extends only to prisoners who were detained in a limited number of protests. Critics of the proposal also note that prisoners facing some of the most serious charges, such as those accused of violent, armed actions, will not be eligible. According to rights groups, these kind of allegations were often arbitrarily applied and often based on fabricated evidence. The bill’s passage comes as the United States is pressuring Delcy Rodríguez, the interim president of Venezuela, to steer its economy toward U.S. interests and to pursue democratic changes after a quarter-century of increasingly authoritarian rule. Over that period, thousands of Venezuelans and foreigners have been detained , many on drummed-up charges, according to rights groups, and usually for opposing the government. “I say this as the acting president of the Chavista government,” Ms. Rodríguez said on Thursday at a ceremony at the presidential palace, where she signed the law after the national legislature approved it earlier that day. “We must know how to ask for forgiveness and how to receive forgiveness, and that is the process that this amnesty law sets in motion.” She also publicly called on Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello to review cases excluded from the amnesty law, a noteworthy move amid tensions between her pragmatic wing of the ruling government and his hard-line faction . Rights groups estimate that 600 to 900 political prisoners remain incarcerated in the country as of this week, including opposition politicians, journalists and others. The groups have documented torture and abuse in Venezuela’s prisons, and dozens of political prisoners have died in captivity or are missing . In addition to concerns about exclusions baked into the amnesty legislation, there is also widespread fear that the government will not fully abide by the new law. The government remains largely unchanged after President Nicolás Maduro was captured by the United States on Jan. 3 and jailed in New York. Ms. Rodríguez must now navigate growing scrutiny at home and from Washington. In a social media post last week, President Trump called relations with Venezuela “extraordinary,” and Ms. Rodríguez said on NBC that she had been invited to the White House. Last week, students organized modest marches and rallies across Venezuela , demanding blanket amnesty for all political prisoners and denouncing the measure as falling short. And on Thursday, United Nations human rights experts called for the unconditional release of all arbitrarily detained people. U.S. and Venezuela officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Image Delcy Rodríguez, the interim president of Venezuela, before her swearing-in last month. Credit... The New York Times Who could be freed under the new law? The new law will apply to many of the hundreds of people incarcerated for reasons linked to their opposition to the government, and will expunge their criminal records. But the amnesty is narrow in scope. Only prisoners detained in connection with about a dozen specific “politically motivated violent events” will be eligible. These events were mostly large protests that in some cases spanned months and include a failed coup against Mr. Chávez in 2002. These restrictions will most likely mean that not all political prisoners will be released, said Nicmer Evans, a political scientist and government critic recently held in El Helicoide . Mr. Evans, who called the law “unjust,” said it could exclude those jailed for criticizing the government outside the periods specified in the law. “Practically all of us journalists who have been detained for our opinions outside of these established time frames are excluded,” he said. Activists are also wary that, under the law, those released must go before the judicial authorities, who will “verify the grounds for amnesty” before granting a pardon, raising concerns that the highly politicized courts may have too much discretion over the process. The activists have called for an independent commission that includes international human rights organizations to supervise carrying out the law.

Rights groups estimate 600 to 900 political prisoners remain incarcerated in the country as of this week. Credit... Alejandro Cegarra for The New York Times Why is this happening now? Ms. Rodríguez has to balance the demands of the Trump administration and an entrenched political system known as Chavismo, after its founder, Mr. Chávez. That system has been sustained through repression and elections marred by fraud, according to Venezuela experts. Ms. Rodríguez and her brother, Jorge Rodríguez, are believed to be some of the chief architects and beneficiaries of that system. Still, since the capture of Mr. Maduro, Ms. Rodríguez has embraced the amnesty law and pledged to close El Helicoide, the prison that Mr. Trump appeared to be referring to when he said that Venezuela had vowed to close a “torture chamber.” More than 400 political prisoners have been released since Mr. Maduro’s ouster. Mr. Rodríguez, the president of the National Assembly, recently apologized to Venezuelans for any crimes committed by the state after Mr. Chávez came to power. Image A mural of former President Hugo Chávez’s eyes in downtown Caracas. Credit... The New York Times Is Venezuela becoming less repressive? Since the capture of Mr. Maduro, there have been emerging signs that repression in the country might be easing . And some Venezuelans say the amnesty law is a key part of that process. “The amnesty is a first step in the right direction,” Michael Penfold, a professor in Caracas of political economy and governance, said on social media Feb. 7. Mr. Penfold, who has been critical of the government, recently joined the interim government’s new Program for Coexistence and Peace, a national plan that seeks to restore political dialogue. But many in Venezuela say the amnesty law does not go far enough. Delsa Solórzano, a lawyer and former legislator who went into hiding after the country’s fraud-marred presidential election in 2024, said in an interview last week that the bill did not include the repeal of certain laws that have “served as real instruments of political persecution,” referencing, among others, an “anti-hate” measure, which has been used to silence critics. The law allows those outside the country, many political exiles, to seek amnesty through their lawyers. But the law excludes anyone who has promoted armed action against Venezuela, like María Corina Machado, the exiled oppositio",

Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 8:58 min Learn more Share full article 414 By Isabel Kershner Adam Rasgon Aaron Boxerman and Natan Odenheimer Photographs by Saher Alghorra This story was reported from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Feb. 19, 2026 As President Trump prepared for the inaugural gathering of his “Board of Peace” in Washington on Thursday, there were detailed proposals encompassing hopes and dreams for a gleaming new postwar Gaza. Then there is reality. “Trump is trying to make things rosy, but as a matter of fact, the situation is still catastrophic,” said Prof. Mkhaimar Abusada, a Palestinian political analyst from Gaza City who was displaced from his home during the Israel-Hamas war and now resides in Cairo. A fragile cease-fire came into force in October, two years after the deadly Hamas-led attack on Israel that ignited the war. But the path forward is uncharted, labyrinthine and strewed with obstacles. “The Trump cease-fire plan is struggling to succeed,” Professor Abusada said, blaming both Hamas and Israel. Member states of the new international body tasked with rebuilding Gaza have pledged more than $5 billion for humanitarian and reconstruction efforts in the enclave, according to Mr. Trump. But that is only a fraction of what is needed. The United Nations has estimated the cost of rebuilding the territory at more than $50 billion. Countries have also committed thousands of troops and personnel, laying the ground work for an International Stabilization Force meant to “maintain Security,” Mr. Trump said. American officials are discussing plans to build a military base for peacekeepers in an Israeli-controlled area of southern Gaza, according to several Western diplomats who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share the information publicly. Image The first night of the holy month of Ramadan at Al-Kanz Mosque in Gaza City on Tuesday. Slick Power Point presentations paint a picture of a futuristic seaside metropolis. But for now, the Israeli military and private contractors are removing unexploded ordnance and rubble from patches of the Israeli-controlled part of Gaza. There are an estimated 60 million tons of war debris to be cleared away. Gaza barely has the basics. Experts have produced a comprehensive paper on waste management, according to internal planning documents viewed by The New York Times. While the war is over, no one would call Gaza safe. Even under the cease-fire, Israeli strikes have killed about 600 Palestinians there, according to local health officials. Their data does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel says its near daily strikes are retaliation against militants who violated the truce or to eliminate imminent threats. But children are among the dead. In all, 72,000 people have been killed since the start of the war, according to Gaza’s health ministry. Israel says thousands of militants were among those killed. Israeli forces now control about half the coastal territory, where anti-Hamas militias have taken up arms and looted aid. A weakened but resilient Hamas prevails for now in the other half, where most of the population of two million is living, many still displaced and in tents. Hamas has pledged to give up the administration of Gaza, but its gunmen are still manning checkpoints, detaining and questioning people, and collecting some fees. Any real progress in Gaza hinges upon the thorniest issues in Mr. Trump’s 20-point peace plan , which was endorsed by the U.N. Security Council. They include disarming Hamas, demilitarizing Gaza and ensuring a withdrawal of Israeli forces. Hamas is reluctant to part with its weapons. The militants rely on them to control the population, and they are also core to its identity as a fighting force against Israel. Image Palestinians mourning their loved ones at a hospital after Israeli airstrikes in Gaza City last month. After being caught off-guard by the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which left about 1,200 people dead, according to Israeli officials, Israel is deeply skeptical of the group’s intentions. For this reason, Israel is still barring the entry into Gaza of many so-called “dual use” items, saying they could be used by Hamas for military purposes. The list changes, but now includes wide-diameter steel tent poles, according to several officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly. The severe food shortages of the war have eased, but Western officials and aid workers accuse Israel, which strictly controls the flow of all goods into Gaza, of slow-walking other kinds of assistance. About 80 percent of the buildings in Gaza were damaged or destroyed during the war, according to the United Nations. But Israel has largely limited or delayed the entry of caravans and temporary homes, despite some harsh winter weather, according to the Shelter Cluster, a group of U.N. and humanitarian agencies working on housing solutions. About 4,000 emergency temporary housing units are either now available or in the pipeline, according to the United Nations. About 200,000 prefab relief housing units are needed to support displaced families, according to Alexander De Croo, a U.N. development official who visited Gaza this week. The Israeli military unit that oversees the entry of aid to Gaza, known as COGAT, rejected accusations that Israel was preventing or delaying assistance. “The reality is completely opposite,” it said in a statement, adding that Israel was meeting its commitment under the cease-fire agreement. The sole border crossing between Gaza and Egypt recently reopened for people on foot after being closed for most of the past 20 months. Only a trickle of Gazans, mainly people seeking medical treatment abroad and their caregivers, or residents returning to the enclave from abroad, have been able to cross it. Making headway is complicated because the main players are reluctant to take risks or make concessions before the other. “All the structures are ready, but on the ground nothing has changed because one thing is dependent on another,” said Shira Efron, chair of Israel policy at the RAND Corporation, a U.S.-based research institute. “Reconstruction and Israeli military withdrawal are contingent on disarmament and the deployment of the International Stabilization Force,” she added. Image Displaced Palestinians in Gaza City last week received prefabricated tents as part of effort to provide more sustainable shelter. After nearly 20 years of dominating Gaza, Hamas has been trying to tighten its hold on the territory, rather than giving it up, Ms. Efron said. “They are the ones enforcing law and order,” she said. “Even the seemingly simple challenge of Hamas handing over the civilian rule of Gaza — which they said they’d agree to do — will be complicated,” she said. Hamas will not be eager to forfeit tax revenues, and it is hard to imagine an orderly transition, she said, noting that the group’s own governance of Gaza was “poor and partial at best.” The Board of Peace has appointed a committee of Palestinian technocrats as a transitional government to replace Hamas, but they are still based in Cairo. The committee members are waiting for a safer environment and a loosening of Israeli restrictions on goods that would improve residents’ lives and give them some credibility as they begin to operate in the territory, according to officials and people briefed on their thinking. “They need to go back with something in their hands to win the hearts and minds of people in Gaza,” Professor Abusada said. For now, committee members have been attending governance training workshops run by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, according to people briefed on their activities. Over it all, the threat looms of a return to war. Image Hamas fighters in Gaza City in November. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel,",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The lieutenant colonel, call sign Executioner, was celebrated in Russian propaganda. He had four Orders of Courage pinned to his chest. In a video shared by the Ministry of Defense, he expressed a defiant wish not to rest from battle until Russia’s “victory” in Ukraine. He bragged about shrapnel wounds from what he said had been a close call. It was all a fraud, according to the Investigative Committee, Russia’s equivalent to the F.B.I. The wounds that Executioner, whose real name is Konstantin Frolov, described in a propaganda video were not suffered in combat, according to the committee. It accused him and another commander from his elite unit, the 83rd Guards Air Assault Brigade, of leading a scheme in which more than 30 soldiers and medics used weapons to shoot themselves in order to obtain payouts for battlefield injuries. The army was defrauded of 200 million rubles, or $2.6 million, in the plot, with the commanders taking a cut, the committee said. Colonel Frolov, who faces charges of fraud, bribery and weapons trafficking in a military court, struck a pretrial deal that amounts to admitting guilt, according to court filings. Such agreements can lead to reduced prison sentences in Russia. Colonel Frolov is scheduled to appear in military court next month in the sentencing phase of his trial. In a telephone interview with The New York Times last year from a pretrial detention center in Moscow, Colonel Frolov did not deny that he had been involved in a scheme to skim money from payments for battlefield injuries. But he offered a different account of the scheme, saying it had involved manipulated record-keeping, not self-inflicted wounds. He said he believed that he was being singled out for prosecution, while others in the military had been absolved of crimes. “It turns out that my country, which spent the whole year calling me a hero, is now contradicting itself and keeping me in a cage,” he said in the courtroom in August 2024. The case has fed public resentment of the economic and social privileges pouring into a military whose soldiers fighting in Ukraine are seen by many Russians as in it only for the money. It also shows that the Russian Army is struggling to stamp out endemic corruption . The 83rd Guards Air Assault Brigade, Colonel Frolov’s unit, is based in the Russian Far East near Vladivostok, more than 4,000 miles from the front lines in Ukraine. A former commander of the brigade, Col. Artem Gorodilov, who was arrested shortly after Colonel Frolov in 2024 and accused of “large-scale fraud,” is being tried separately. Two years before, Colonel Gorodilov had commanded the 234th Guards Air Assault Regiment, which Ukrainian prosecutors have accused of at least 40 war crimes during the monthlong occupation of Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv. Image Ukrainian soldiers salvaging parts from a Russian armored vehicle after the occupation of Bucha in 2022. Credit... Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times Colonel Gorodilov’s wife and his lawyer declined to comment when approached by The New York Times. In November 2024, President Vladimir V. Putin signed a decree that soldiers would be compensated 3 million rubles, or about $39,000, for severe injuries and 1 million rubles for injuries considered minor. Colonel Frolov, in the interview last year, said soldiers in his unit who suffered multiple wounds in single attacks had falsely claimed that the injuries took place in separate incidents, which entitled them to more than one payment. He said he did not consider this to be fraud. He asserted that his own injuries had been sustained on the battlefield and were not self-inflicted, as the committee has said. Addressing the weapons trafficking charges, he acknowledged that he had taken some weapons as “souvenirs.” Colonel Frolov said that a driver for a higher-ranking officer had testified against him and Colonel Gorodilov under pressure, after being threatened with criminal conviction for transporting drugs to the front lines. Colonel Frolov also said that his arrest was retribution for a video he had recorded accusing a former Ministry of Defense official of incompetent leadership and forcing troops into mass-casualty missions known as “meat grinder” assaults. “They want to pin everything on us because we spoke out against the command, against those old men in charge,” he said. He said that he was being targeted to pressure his father, Oleg Frolov, a former senior official responsible for military armament at Russia’s space agency, Roscosmos. The father also faces official accusations of corruption. Colonel Frolov’s claims could not be independently verified. One paratrooper who served under Colonel Frolov and Colonel Gorodilov said it was common practice in the brigade for commanders to encourage soldiers to exaggerate injuries, though he said he was not aware of soldiers’ shooting themselves. The troops would give part of their injury payments to the higher-ups, he said. The paratrooper, Daniil, said that commanders had also demanded money from soldiers in exchange for benefits like time off. Like other soldiers, he agreed to speak to The Times only if his surname was withheld, for fear of retribution. “If you want a vacation, you need to be injured. The idea was: ‘We injure you, you give us the money — a million — and then you go on leave as a result of the injury and end up with two million.’ That’s how they made money on it.” One million rubles — the cut for commanders, Daniil said — is about $13,000. Another paratrooper in their brigade, Vladimir, said that in the Russian military, “money still determines everything.” He added that the war had become a big business for some. Pavel Luzin, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said the Kremlin tried to keep what he called a “demoralized and decayed officer corps” under relative control. Mr. Luzin said officials used a carrot and stick approach in which some commanders are allowed to profit but others will be “punished from time to time.” With Russia’s wartime expenditures ballooning and corruption hurting its performance on the battlefield, security agencies have to look for ways to send a signal that graft will be punished, said Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. At least 12 high-ranking Russian military officials and generals, as well as dozens of lower-ranking officers, have been indicted on corruption charges in the past couple of years. “When people profit from tragedy — from a war that is sacred to Putin — it generates political fuel for other actors, including security officials seeking career advancement and those willing to push such cases forward,” Ms. Stanovaya said. Throughout the war, as Russian propaganda portrayed him as a battlefield hero, Colonel Frolov appeared on his wife’s social media feed vacationing and partying. In 2022, he attended two weddings in St. Petersburg and went boating on the Gulf of Finland with his wife, according to images she posted on social media. In 2023, he attended a concert in St. Petersburg with a V.I.P. badge draped around his neck. In 2024, he attended a party celebrating his 37th birthday, captured in an Instagram reel. He also made trips to the mountainous Altai region and to Kaliningrad, the Russian exclave on the Baltic Sea, according to stories his wife shared on social media.

Credit... via Social Media She did not respond to requests for comment from The Times. In the interview last year, Colonel Frolov said he believed that he and his co-defendants were being held to a double standard at a time when Russia was pardoning people accused or convicted of crimes if they went to the front lines. “I mostly had convicts under my command,” he said. “People are forgiven for almost anything — to make them go to fight in the war",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Most people who trickled into a historical movie theater in the border city of McAllen, Texas, this week had heard of Bobby Pulido, the Latin Grammy Award-winning Tejano singer running for Congress in the oddly shaped district jutting from the border to the outskirts of San Antonio, some 250 miles straight north. But on this day, the candidate they had come to hear was the one breathing fire about dismantling Immigration and Customs Enforcement, legalizing abortion and challenging the insular Democratic Party in the Rio Grande Valley. That wasn’t Mr. Pulido , the favorite of the party. It was Ada Cuellar, an emergency room doctor running considerably to his left. Alex Cantu, 42, said Mr. Pulido’s run was “a fame grab” by “basically what I would refer to as an establishment politician.” Mr. Cantu had organized a vigil after federal agents killed Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, and he said he wanted real change. The fight for the Democratic nomination to challenge Representative Monica De La Cruz, the Republican incumbent in Texas’ 15th District, gets to the struggle for the soul of the party in 2026. Democratic primary voters in Texas began voting Tuesday ahead of the March 3 primary, and their choice, like many Democrats around the country, is whether they want to push their party to the left in a year when the wind is at Democrats’ back, or elevate centrists who traditionalists say can win swing districts like the 15th in November. The Democratic primary for the seat of Texas’ senior senator , John Cornyn, holds a similar dynamic, pitting Representative Jasmine Crockett, a firebrand intent on mobilizing the Democratic base, against State Representative James Talarico, who is appealing to the center and disaffected Republicans. Image Voters in McAllen, Texas, came to the historical Cine El Rey to see Ada Cuellar, who is running in the Democratic primary for the city’s House district. Credit... Gabriel V. Cárdenas for The New York Times Image “I’m told I’m a progressive,” said Dr. Cuellar, who is using her own money to finance an insurgent primary campaign in a South Texas House district. Credit... Gabriel V. Cárdenas for The New York Times But far from the glare of that spotlight are Democratic voters in El Valle, as the Rio Grande Valley is known. And there, another question looms: Where will the Hispanic voters who flocked to President Trump in 2024 go in 2026, amid the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown, and which type of candidate do they prefer? Cine El Rey is known as the Mexican Apollo because its advocacy of Mexican cinema parallels the Apollo Theater’s advocacy of Black artists in Harlem, and inside, Dr. Cuellar, who recently added a law degree to her medical résumé, was doing some advocacy of her own. She promised to push for the dismantling of ICE and had harsh words for Democratic Party stalwarts who have made their preference for Mr. Pulido clear . “I’m told I’m a progressive,” Dr. Cuellar said in an interview. Mr. Pulido, with his endorsements, name recognition and a ground game that has touched all 11 counties in the district, appears to be the favorite, but not necessarily with the voters most frustrated with Mr. Trump’s return to power, like Mia Diaz-Aleman. “We need someone who is a fighter,” Ms. Diaz-Aleman, 42, of McAllen, said of Dr. Cuellar, adding, “We’ve done the central view before, and that has gotten us nowhere.” Over the summer, the Republican-controlled state legislature redrew the 15th District to favor their candidate, but if Latino voters are shifting, Democrats believe the district is still in play — with the right candidate. Dr. Cuellar, who has poured a lot of her own money into her campaign, said she supports codifying Roe v. Wade, expanding access to health care to all and pushing for federal immigration authorities to confine enforcement actions to criminals. She also has the endorsement of Ms. Crockett. She describes herself as a “mama bear” and a “fighter,” a single mother who decided to run after years of frustration with the local political system and its “compadrismo,” or cronyism, where only those with political connections are supported. “People want somebody outside of the establishment,” she said. Mr. Pulido is less categorical and more circumspect. He wants a secure border but opposes agents going after otherwise law-abiding immigrants. He wants to expand health care, but especially to those in poor or rural communities, where people often have to drive long distances to find a hospital. He wants to do away with some tariffs, the ones that hurt agriculture.

Gabriel V. Cárdenas for The New York Times The race has also turned personal, in large part thanks to ads and social media posts for Dr. Cuellar and social media posts that attack Mr. Pulido for his views on abortion and ties to Democratic Party leaders. “People are just waking up right now,” Dr. Cuellar said. “I’m the one who is pro-choice and he wants to leave it to Texas politicians.” In an interview this week in his native Edinburg, Texas, Mr. Pulido said that while he personally opposes abortion, he also opposes his state’s near-total ban on abortion, without exceptions for rape and incest. Pushed again, he went much further, saying women should be able to make their own medical decisions. “It’s not my place to tell a woman what she can do with her body,” he said. “Policy is different than my personal beliefs.” He said he also has his eyes on the general election. He has decided not to run negative ads against his opponent and said he’ll continue to rely on events that attract far larger crowds than the two dozen or so that came to Cine El Rey to see Dr. Cuellar. Democratic leaders in the area have said that they will not endorse anyone in the race until after the primary, but some expressed confidence that Mr. Pulido’s more socially conservative stances could bring back voters from the Republican camp. Mr. Pulido, a father of four and a generational Texas Latino with two Latin Grammy Awards, said people see him as a rugged cowboy-hat-wearing Spanish-language performer with rural sensibilities. Outside an early polling site in Edinburg, Ernesto Rosales, 48, a gun owner and longtime Democrat, said he agreed. “When you decide to run normally, people don’t know who you are, right? And you have to spend a lot of time and a lot of money and a lot of effort to build that name recognition,” Mr. Rosales said. “Bobby didn’t need to do that. He’s a name brand here and with the Latino community.” “To me he resonates, because he’s a middle of the ground kind of guy,” he said. “He speaks to me.” Edgar Sandoval covers Texas for The Times, with a focus on the Latino community and the border with Mexico.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT President Trump said on Thursday that he had directed his administration to begin releasing files related to aliens, extraterrestrial life and unidentified flying objects, only hours after attacking former President Barack Obama for saying that aliens were real. It was the latest effort by Mr. Trump, ever the television showman, to stir anticipation for the release of secret government documents , even as he has continued to lash out at reporters over the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files and his connections to the disgraced financier. The release of the Epstein files has dragged on for nearly a year and Mr. Trump did not set a timeline for files on aliens. “Based on the tremendous interest shown,” Mr. Trump wrote on social media, he had directed officials to “begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters.” For decades, sightings of cutting-edge spy planes, drones, low-orbit satellites and weather balloons have driven theories about U.F.O.s, most famously at a secret military flight testing base called Area 51 . While many reports of unidentified flying objects remain unsolved , the Pentagon has found no evidence that the government was covering up knowledge of extraterrestrial technology and has said there is no evidence that any U.F.O. sightings represented alien visitation to Earth. But government assurances have done little to deter U.F.O. enthusiasts, who continue to trade theories and grainy videos of strange phenomena in the skies on Reddit and other social media platforms. The beginnings of Mr. Trump’s latest planned file dump started with a podcast interview. Brian Tyler Cohen, a YouTuber and podcast host, asked Mr. Obama in an interview that released on Saturday if aliens were real. The former president replied, “they’re real, but I haven’t seen them and they’re not being kept in Area 51.” He added, jokingly, “unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president.” Mr. Cohen did not ask any follow-up questions about aliens. Mr. Obama’s remarks pinballed across the internet as commentators speculated about what he had meant. Mr. Obama later clarified on social media that he meant that extraterrestrial life likely exists out in the universe, but that as far as he knew they had not visited Earth. He insisted, “I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!” When asked about Mr. Obama’s speculative remarks on Air Force One earlier on Thursday, Mr. Trump claimed that Mr. Obama “gave classified information, he’s not supposed to be doing that.” When a reporter asked for clarification, and if aliens were real, Trump said that he didn’t know, but repeated his suggestion that Obama’s remarks had revealed classified information. “He made a big mistake,” Mr. Trump said, with what appeared to be a smile . “He took it out of classified information.” Mr. Trump added that he did not have an opinion on the matter and that he would get Mr. Obama “out of trouble by declassifying” the relevant documents.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Large banners of President Trump now hang from multiple federal buildings in Washington, including the nation’s top law enforcement branch, in a bold statement of power and influence over the government. A long blue banner with Mr. Trump’s visage was draped on the exterior of the Justice Department headquarters in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, making it the latest federal building to have a banner with the president’s face. The banner’s lower border says “Make America Safe Again” in capital letters. The signage is a strikingly prominent indication of how Mr. Trump has eroded the separation that has long existed between the Justice Department and the White House to protect the department from political influence. That careful distance has been dissolving since the beginning of Mr. Trump’s second term. He has installed allies at the top ranks of the department to oversee a retribution campaign and investigate perceived political enemies. Hundreds of agency lawyers have since been fired, and thousands more have resigned . The White House referred all questions pertaining to the Justice Department’s banner — including the reason behind its installation, its cost and the duration of its display — to the Justice Department, which did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Similar banners were installed at other federal buildings last year, including the Agriculture Department and Labor Department. The banner hung between columns at the Washington headquarters of the Agriculture Department says “Growing America Since 1862.” It hangs a few columns away from a banner depicting Abraham Lincoln. An Agriculture Department spokesperson said on Thursday that the department was excited to celebrate America’s 250th anniversary, “particularly the roles our farmers and ranchers had in shaping our nation.” Image The Department of Agriculture.

Eric Lee for The New York Times The Trump banner at the Labor Department says, “American Workers First,” also in capital letters, and carries the emblem for the nation’s 250th anniversary. Along the same frontage hangs a banner showing Theodore Roosevelt, with the same wording and emblem. Those two banners cost roughly $6,000, and were originally created for Labor Day, said Courtney Parella, a spokeswoman for the Labor Department. After receiving “tremendous positive response,” the department decided that they would stay up throughout the celebrations for America’s semiquincentennial, she said. The banners follow a string of efforts by the administration to emblazon the president’s name and face on everything from coins to national park passes . Such displays are more often a feature of countries run by dictators, not democratically elected leaders. “This is not just egotistical self-satisfaction, it’s a way of expanding presidential power,” Michael Beschloss, the presidential historian, told The Times recently . “A president is more powerful, I assume he believes, if he is ever-present than if he keeps his head down.” The same day that the banner was hung on the Justice Department building, Mr. Trump hosted the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace , a new international body he created. It was held at the Donald J. Trump United States Institute of Peace, a decades-old organization recently renamed for the president. “Marco named it after me,” Mr. Trump said in his opening remarks at Board of Peace meeting, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio sat a few feet away. “I had nothing to do with it, I swear I didn’t. I swear. I had no idea.” Ashley Ahn covers breaking news for The Times from New York.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT President Trump started the day on Thursday by celebrating peace in the Middle East while also threatening to launch a new, all-out attack in the region. Shortly thereafter, he celebrated that his handpicked arts commission had approved his $400 million White House ballroom project. By the day’s end, Mr. Trump was speaking to a crowd in northwest Georgia, where he was supposed to focus on the economy and jobs but spent much of the time on wild tangents: railing against the Supreme Court, making false claims of voter fraud and calling himself a “ schmuck ” for donating his presidential salary. The president’s head-spinning day came as Republicans look to Mr. Trump to lock down a message that will resonate ahead of the midterms, when the party could face big losses. They want him to stay focused on an economic message to help his party keep control of Congress in November’s midterm elections — but Mr. Trump is never one to stay on message. In fact, he sounded as though he wanted to move on entirely from the one issue they want him to focus on — affordability — as Democrats hammer him on the cost of living and high prices. “What word have you not heard over the last two weeks? Affordability,” Mr. Trump said at a rally at a steel distributor in Rome, Ga. “Because I’ve won. I’ve won affordability.” Earlier this week, the president’s top aides and cabinet officials gathered near the U.S. Capitol to discuss their midterm strategy. The takeaway was clear: The economy would be the deciding factor in the midterms, strategists and pollsters said, and Republicans needed to stay laser-focused. But even if Republican candidates and Mr. Trump’s aides focus on the economy, they can never match the megaphone of their leader, who is not quite so laser-focused on the issue. Still, Mr. Trump and his allies have been eager to celebrate his economic wins on the heels of two strong economic reports : Employment growth in January came in at more than twice the rate that economists had expected, and inflation was softer than predicted. In his speech on Thursday, Mr. Trump attributed the country’s economic success to his tariff policies. He has vowed that the levies will reduce U.S. imports and shrink the trade deficit. “Tariff is my favorite word in the whole dictionary,” he said. But data released on Thursday showed the opposite of what Mr. Trump has promised has occurred : U.S. imports grew last year, and the trade deficit in goods hit a record high. Mr. Trump’s vision of reviving American manufacturing has so far not borne out either. U.S. manufacturers have cut more than 80,000 jobs in the past year. Mr. Trump did not mention that data on Thursday. Instead, he regaled the audience with anecdotes of his conversations with business leaders who have told the president of major investments they’re making in the United States because of his tariffs. He became most animated when discussing the pending Supreme Court case over his ability to institute sweeping tariffs. “I have to wait for this decision,” he said, raising his voice. “I’ve been waiting forever. Forever. And the language is clear that I have the right to do it as president. I have the right to put tariffs on for national security purposes.” In November, a majority of Supreme Court justices asked skeptical questions about Mr. Trump’s use of emergency powers to impose tariffs. A decision in the case could come as soon as Friday. Even though the speech was billed as part of Mr. Trump’s nationwide economic tour, the president, as he often does, frequently veered off topic. He rehashed some of his longstanding grievances — including not getting enough credit for growing the economy, and the media not recognizing him for eschewing his presidential salary. Throughout his meandering speech, Mr. Trump often found his way back to his core message: that former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. destroyed the country and Mr. Trump has resuscitated it. But not all of Mr. Trump’s supporters are feeling the economic renaissance the president described on Thursday. Charles Painter, 47, of Ringgold, Ga., described himself as a longtime supporter of the president, but he is still looking for economic relief. He said his property taxes had tripled. “It’s going slow, but hopefully it gets there,” Mr. Painter said. Mr. Trump’s trip took him back to the district that was, until last month, represented by Marjorie Taylor Greene, once a staunch supporter of the president. Ms. Greene said she broke with the president over his handling of the Epstein files, his commitment to “America first” ideals and his efforts to lower health care costs. She abruptly resigned from Congress in the middle of her term, creating a special election for her seat. As Ms. Greene stepped up her criticism, Mr. Trump branded her a “traitor.” Ms. Greene did not attend Thursday’s event. In the special election to fill Ms. Greene’s former seat, Mr. Trump has endorsed Clay Fuller, a local prosecutor. Mr. Fuller spoke before Mr. Trump on Thursday, and then the president invited him back to the stage because he “loved what he said.” Tyler Pager is a White House correspondent for The Times, covering President Trump and his administration.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The Trump administration announced on Thursday that it was reviving a proposal to prevent undocumented immigrants from receiving federal housing assistance, a policy that could displace tens of thousands of legal residents and citizens, many of them children , who live with unauthorized relatives in public housing. The proposal comes as the Department of Housing and Urban Development has stepped up efforts to scrutinize public housing rolls for undocumented immigrants, telling public housing authorities across the country on Friday that they would face sanctions if they did not do more to verify the legal status of residents. The Department of Housing and Urban Development had previously instructed landlords to follow existing rules that allow families of mixed immigration status to live in subsidized housing, so long as at least one household member is a legal resident. In those cases, the subsidies are prorated based on the number of eligible members of the family. But Scott Turner, the former pro football player whom President Trump picked to lead HUD, said in a fiery statement peppered with references to “illegal aliens” and “fraudsters” that his department would now move forward with a “zero tolerance” policy aimed at ejecting all undocumented immigrants, who he said were “riding the coattails of American taxpayers.” The move was a return to a policy, pushed by immigration hard-liners like Stephen Miller, that was first proposed in 2019, in Mr. Trump’s first term. Officials had said it was necessary to cut down on long waiting lists for public housing. The department’s statement gave similar reasoning on Thursday, writing that “HUD resources serve only a quarter of eligible households in need.” (The Trump administration issued plans in November to drastically slash support for long-term housing programs .) The 2019 proposal faced stiff opposition from landlords and local officials , who said that it would displace some of their most reliable tenants and add major financial strains to an already cash-strapped system. Undocumented immigrants, they said, generally pay rent on time, in part out of fear of drawing attention and referrals to law enforcement. According to a HUD analysis in 2019, more than 108,000 people receiving housing benefits were in a household with at least one undocumented immigrant. Because many of those immigrants have children who are U.S. citizens or legal residents, HUD estimated at the time that as many as 55,000 children who were in the country legally would have been displaced from public housing under the policy. There are more than 2.2 million residents in public housing nationwide . The HUD statement on Thursday characterized the current rule allowing mixed-status families to live together with prorated benefits as a “roommate loophole.” The statement was headlined: “Illegals, Ineligibles, and Fraudsters: Pack Your Bags,” accompanied by emojis.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The MAHA Moms have turned on President Trump. When Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. threw his support behind Mr. Trump’s 2024 campaign for the White House, his corps of health conscious, mostly female, followers embraced the president, who pledged to address Americans’ concerns about “toxins in our environments and pesticides in our food.” Some of the women, who call themselves the MAHA Moms after Mr. Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again movement, abandoned the Democratic Party to vote for Mr. Trump. But the executive order Mr. Trump issued Wednesday to increase domestic production of glyphosate — a widely used weedkiller and possible carcinogen that has been the target of thousands of lawsuits, including one brought by Mr. Kennedy — stunned and infuriated the activists. It now threatens to turn the brief MAHA-Trump marriage into a divorce. “Women feel like they were lied to, that MAHA movement is a sham,” said Alex Clark, a health and wellness podcaster for the conservative group Turning Point U.S.A., which is closely allied with the president. “How am I supposed to rally these women to vote red in the midterms? How can we win their trust back? I am unsure if we can.” Across the country on Thursday, many women who identified with the movement expressed similar feelings of betrayal from the president. But Mr. Kennedy, who issued a statement saying that Mr. Trump’s order would strengthen “our defense readiness and our food supply,” was spared the wrath of the movement’s leaders, if not its rank and file. “Secretary Kennedy has done everything he said he’s going to do,” said Vani Hari , a healthy eating activist and one-time Democrat (she worked to elect President Barack Obama) who has advised the administration on food policy. “He has upheld his commitment to the American people. Now, whether his boss is doing that is another story.” Image Robert F. Kennedy Jr. gave support to the Trump statement on glyphosate. Credit... Al Drago for The New York Times Ms. Hari has millions of social media followers. “There is a level of anger and frustration like I’ve never witnessed before,” she said. On her Instagram page, some of that anger was directed at Mr. Kennedy. “This begs the question why didn’t sec Kennedy have a say and stop it,” one commenter wrote. It is unclear whether the secretary was consulted on the order before it was issued. The White House and a spokesman for Mr. Kennedy would not say. “Where is RFK Jr.?” another commenter asked. In issuing his order, Mr. Trump invoked the Defense Production Act, a Korean-war era law that allows the government to compel the manufacture of supplies that are critical for national defense. The order is aimed at boosting domestic supplies of phosphorous, which is necessary for the manufacture of certain munitions, as well as for glyphosate, which has been deemed “probably carcinogenic to humans” by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Glyphosate is marketed as the weedkiller Roundup. In 2018, Mr. Kennedy helped win a $289 million jury award against Roundup’s maker, Monsanto, now owned by Bayer. “Ensuring an adequate supply of elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based herbicides is thus crucial to the national security and defense, including food-supply security,” the order said. Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, defended the order, saying it was “not an endorsement of any product or practice.” In a statement on behalf of Monsanto, a Bayer spokesman said Mr. Trump’s executive order “reinforces the critical need for U.S. farmers to have access to essential, domestically produced crop protection tools.” The company will “comply with this order to produce glyphosate and elemental phosphorus,” he said. Image Farm gear being loaded with glyphosate, also marketed as Roundup, in Illinois in 2010. Credit... Seth Perlman/Associated Press The order provides limited legal immunity to glyphosate’s makers, though it is unlikely to protect them against product liability lawsuits. Mr. Trump’s critics see the president helping the chemical industry and question whether there is legal justification for the order. “Invoking the Defense Production Act to spur the domestic production of glyphosate is a gross abuse of presidential authority,” said Lawrence O. Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University. “There is scant evidence that the United States’ agricultural sector and its ability to ensure a stable food supply is at risk.” Mr. Trump also faced pushback from Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican of Kentucky, who last month helped scuttle legislation that would have effectively given legal immunity to glyphosate manufacturers. Mr. Massie said Thursday that he would introduce legislation seeking to undo Mr. Trump’s order. The campaign against glyphosate has been central to the MAHA movement. Zen Honeycutt, the founder of the advocacy group Moms Across America, has been a leader in that campaign, commissioning private laboratory testing for pesticide residue and petitioning retailers to remove the chemicals from their shelves by framing it as a risk to children. In an interview, Ms. Honeycutt called Mr. Trump’s order “an egregious offense to what he promised” and “a betrayal.” As for Mr. Kennedy, she said his hands are tied: “Bobby is not in charge of Trump.” Representatives of MAHA Action and the MAHA Institute, part of a constellation of groups that support Mr. Kennedy’s agenda, did not respond to requests for comment. Environmental groups, which had been sidelined under the current administration, said the MAHA movement was to blame for throwing its support behind a president that had proven himself to be disastrous for health and the environment in his first term. “They voted for Trump, and they own this,” said Ken Cook, president and co-founder of the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization that has worked on pesticide issues. “Of course they were betrayed. And they betrayed the rest of us,” he said, adding, “There were plenty of warning signs.” There had indeed been red flags. Image Lee Zeldin, right, the E.P.A. administrator, appearing with Mr. Kennedy last year. Credit... Niki Chan Wylie for The New York Times Last year, the Trump administration supported Bayer in a case that seeks to determine whether federal law shields pesticide manufacturers from lawsuits. Republicans in Congress have also proposed measures that would have effectively shielded Bayer and other pesticides makers from payouts to plaintiffs. That measure was defeated by a coalition of environmental groups, but a similar provision has been added to a draft of the farm bill. The Trump administration has appointed former chemical industry executives and lobbyists to senior roles overseeing pesticides and toxic chemicals, angering several prominent MAHA activists who circulated a petition last fall calling for E.P.A. Administrator Lee Zeldin to be fired. Mr. Zeldin has since promised that the agency would adopt a “MAHA agenda.” That agenda has not been released. Now, there is “a widening disconnect” between the voters who want to reduce chemicals and pesticides and the Trump administration, said Kelly Ryerson, an influencer and former investment banker who attended the meeting with Mr. Zeldin. A loose confederation that brings together some people on the environmental left and the libertarian right, the movement has rallied around three primary issues: “health freedom,” including skepticism of vaccines and opposition to vaccine mandates; healthy eating; and reducing exposure to toxic chemicals. In October, a KFF/Washington Post survey of nearly 3,000 parents found that about 38 percent identified as supporters of the MAHA movement. That figure rose to 62 percent among parents who identified as Republican, and to 81 percent among parents who identified as MAGA Republicans.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT When President George W. Bush began preparing the country for the invasion of Iraq, he traveled the country making the case that Saddam Hussein’s government, and its weapons, posed an unacceptable threat to the United States. Speaking in Cincinnati’s Union Terminal one October night in 2002, he warned that Iraq could attack the United States “on any given day” with chemical or biological weapons. He compared the urgency of the moment to the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, declaring doing nothing was “the riskiest of all options.” Most of Mr. Bush’s arguments turned out to be fanciful, based on selective intelligence and in some cases outright false claims. The war that followed is now considered by many historians as one of the gravest American strategic errors of modern times. But if Mr. Bush made a false case, President Trump, facing a decision about whether to unleash a second major military assault on Iran in less than a year, has made almost no case at all. With two carrier groups and dozens of fighter jets, bombers and refueling aircraft now massing within striking distance of Iran , Mr. Trump is threatening another attack. He is doing so without providing assessments about the urgency of the threat or any explanation of why he needs to strike again after claiming the nuclear sites he targeted had been “obliterated.” Though Mr. Trump is largely fixated on the nuclear weapons program, at various moments he and his aides have cited a range of other rationales for military action: protecting the protesters that Iranian forces killed by the thousands last month, wiping out the arsenal of missiles that Iran can use to strike Israel, and ending Tehran’s support for Hamas and Hezbollah. Then there is the question of whether military force, the hammer Mr. Trump reaches for so quickly, can even accomplish those ends. Most of Iran’s near-bomb-grade uranium is already buried from the last strike , in June. And it is not clear how airstrikes would immediately aid protesters around the country or persuade Iran to stop funding terror. Mr. Trump has never consistently described his goals, and when he talks about them it is usually in a haze of brief, offhand comments. The president has given no speeches preparing the American public for a strike on a country of about 90 million people, and sought no approval from Congress. He has not explained why he has chosen this moment to confront Iran instead of, for example, North Korea, which in the years after Mr. Trump’s failed negotiations in the first term has expanded its nuclear arsenal to 60 or more warheads, by U.S. intelligence estimates, and is working to demonstrate they can reach the United States. Mr. Trump’s national security strategy did not mention North Korea once. And when pressed on Iran, Mr. Trump regularly deflects questions about whether regime change is his true goal, leaving unclear what kind of end-state he seeks — other than an Iran that can never obtain nuclear weapons. His secretary of state, Marco Rubio, when pressed on the question in testimony in late January, conceded that forcing a leadership change in Iran — something the C.I.A. last accomplished in 1953 — would be “far more complex” than the operation the United States conducted to oust Nicolás Maduro as Venezuela’s president. “You’re talking about a regime that’s in place for a very long time,” he told senators. “So that’s going to require a lot of careful thinking, if that eventuality ever presents itself.” Rarely in modern times has the United States prepared to conduct a major act of war with so little explanation and so little public debate. As Mr. Trump gathered the first meeting of the “Board of Peace” at the White House to discuss the rebuilding of Gaza, he veered briefly into the topic of imminent action in Iran, describing only the vaguest of objectives. “They cannot continue to threaten the stability of the entire region, and they must make a deal,” he said, without describing the scope of that deal. “Bad things will happen if it doesn’t” strike that deal, he said, moving back to the topic of Gaza. There are, of course, huge differences with the Iraq invasion. As in Venezuela, Mr. Trump envisions no ground invasion. That avoids the often-voiced critique of his MAGA base that Mr. Trump is risking another “forever war.” Mr. Trump’s calculus is clearly that the base will tolerate bombing runs, which demonstrate the unmatched power of American forces to destroy from afar, as long as the risk to American lives is limited. And, at the outset of the Iraq invasion, Mr. Bush had the support of a large number of Western allies, starting with Britain. The weekend before the Iraq invasion, Mr. Bush met in the Azores with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and the leaders of Spain and Portugal to issue one last ultimatum to Mr. Hussein and plan for an Iraq that would be “whole, free and at peace,” with its oil reserves protected for the Iraqi people. But in this case, none of the allies appear to be joining with the United States in military planning, except for Israel. Britain’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, held a phone conversation with Mr. Trump on Tuesday, and according to The Times of London , Mr. Starmer refused to let Mr. Trump use British airfield facilities at the Diego Garcia base in the Indian Ocean or a Royal Air Force station in Gloucestershire to conduct any operations against Iran. British officials did not confirm or deny the report, but the next day, Mr. Trump issued a blast against Britain’s pending deal for a 100-year lease on the Diego Garcia base. At least the British were aware of Mr. Trump’s plans. Senior officials representing several of the United States’ closest NATO allies said at the Munich Security Conference last weekend that they had gotten almost no details of American plans from Washington. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive military issues. Several of them expressed deep skepticism that the United States could make a compelling case that military action was needed. In fact, Mr. Trump may well be ignoring one of the first rules of the “Powell Doctrine,” the lessons born of the Vietnam War and developed by Colin Powell when he was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “The essence of the post-Vietnam consensus on the use of force is that the political objective must be clearly articulated,” said Robert S. Litwak, a political scientist at George Washington University who has written extensively on negotiating with Iran. “With Iran, Trump is again breaking with that consensus by offering multiple rationales for this preventive military action, from nonproliferation to protecting protesters to regime change.” In the negotiations, which last took place on Tuesday in Geneva, Mr. Trump’s two lead negotiators — Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner — are pressing the country to permanently give up all ability to enrich uranium. The Iranians, according to officials familiar with the negotiations, say they are willing to suspend the production of nuclear materials, maybe for a decade, but refuse to abandon what they view as a right to enrich nuclear material under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, to which Iran is a signatory. It is also unclear whether the Iranians will allow truly in-depth inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear watchdog. For Mr. Trump, the bar for a comprehensive agreement is high. He must demonstrate that any deal he wins in the next two weeks is far better than what President Barack Obama got in two and a half years of intense negotiation. During his first presidential campaign in 2016, Mr. Trump harshly criticized the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the Obama administration, declaring he would have walked out of the room during the negotiations. In 2018, he pulled out of the accord, calling it “the worst deal ever.” But now he is in something of a diplomatic box. He faces pressure to ",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT President Trump, whose family has done more to profit from the presidency than any other in modern history, complained in an economic speech on Thursday that he was a “schmuck” to donate his presidential salary and falsely claimed that he was the only one to do so. The Constitution mandates that the president receive a salary, but John F. Kennedy and Herbert Hoover donated theirs to charity because they were among the wealthiest to serve in the role. For several years in his first term, Mr. Trump donated his presidential salary, often directing it to government agencies like the National Park Service, but appeared to stop doing so by 2020 , according to his tax returns. “We’ve had wealthy presidents before,” Mr. Trump said in an address in Rome, Ga., on Thursday, before falsely saying that “in the history of our country, there’s never been a president that waived his salary. I’m the only schmuck. I get no credit for it. You know what, I get no credit for it. Nobody writes about it.” He added, “It’s a couple million bucks, it’s not peanuts.” Little is written about Mr. Trump’s $400,000 annual salary. He has aggressively profited from the presidency at a scale that dwarfs his constitutionally-mandated paycheck , embarking on an audacious moneymaking campaign in his second term. The Trump family and its business partners have collected at least $320 million in fees from the sales of just one Trump-branded cryptocurrency. Mr. Trump, his family and his allies have greenlit a yawning list of business ventures that would have once been considered ethically unthinkable. The most lucrative of these has been the Trump cryptocurrency empire — with Mr. Trump and his business partners launching the $TRUMP coin just before his second inauguration. After taking office, the president hosted a private dinner for the top buyers of his crypto coin . Many who have signed deals with Trump family members and companies have business before the government. Figures like Elon Musk and other billionaires aligned with the president have benefited from regulatory decisions that Mr. Trump oversees. Members of Mr. Trump’s cabinet, aides and their families have also benefited from his directing capital investment to specific industries . Mr. Trump has also accepted a luxury jetliner from Qatar , worth an estimated $200 million. Mr. Trump has said that he will use the jet as Air Force One while president, after it is retrofitted at an expected cost of hundreds of millions of dollars, and that it will be transferred to his eventual presidential library after he leaves office in 2029. Ethical experts warn that there could be nothing to stop him from using it as his personal plane and say that the jet violates the Constitution’s Foreign Emoluments Clause against accepting gifts from foreign governments. Mr. Trump has filed multiple lawsuits against the government demanding billions in compensation , claiming that he will donate the proceeds. Because Mr. Trump appointed the leaders of those agencies, it may be up to his own loyalists to determine how to respond.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT President Trump convened the first meeting of his new Board of Peace on Thursday, announcing $7 billion in pledges from nine member countries to rebuild Gaza while offering few details about how Hamas can be disarmed or when Israel might fully withdraw from the Palestinian territory. And in an unexpected foray into European politics that flouted diplomatic protocol, Mr. Trump publicly declared his “complete and total endorsement” for Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, in elections in April. A right-wing populist and immigration hard-liner who attended the peace event in Washington, Mr. Orban is a hero to many pro-Trump conservatives but has struggled in polls ahead of the vote. American presidents sometimes signal their preferences in foreign elections, but it is unusual for one to issue an explicit endorsement, for fear of seeming to meddle in another country’s politics. Mr. Trump said Mr. Orban “does an incredible job on immigration.” Hosting Thursday’s event, Mr. Trump announced that nine of the more than 20 member countries have agreed to contribute to the Gaza rebuilding effort. Several are wealthy Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, which said it would donate $1.2 billion. Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania said they would commit peacekeeping troops to Gaza, while Egypt and Jordan have committed troops to train police there. Mr. Trump also said the United States would contribute $10 billion to the board, without saying where the money would come from or whether Congress had been consulted on the matter. The event was held at the U.S. Institute of Peace building in Washington. The modernist federal building was constructed to house an organization by the same name created by Congress in 1984, and which the Trump administration largely dismantled last year. Mr. Trump’s name has since been added to the building’s facade . The foreign leaders who spoke at the event mixed praise for Mr. Trump with talk of Gaza’s bright future. But the juxtaposition of eye-popping dollar figures and thin policy details was conspicuous.

Cross/The New York Times Hamas has still not agreed to disarm, and Israel still occupies much of the devastated territory, which by some estimates will cost $70 billion to rebuild. The promises of money and peacekeepers came with few specifics or timetables. Mr. Trump announced his Board of Peace last fall, saying it would oversee the enactment of an October 2025 cease-fire that his administration had brokered between Israel and Hamas. A United Nations Security Council resolution later authorized the body to “set the framework, and coordinate funding for, the redevelopment of Gaza.” But Mr. Trump — who celebrates himself as a peacemaker with inflated claims about having “stopped” eight wars worldwide — has since suggested grander ambitions for the board. “I think it’s going to go far beyond Gaza,” he told reporters on Monday. “I think it’ll be based all over.” During Thursday’s event he went even further, suggesting that the board might one day supersede the United Nations itself. In the future, he said, “the Board of Peace is going to almost be looking over the United Nations and making sure it runs properly.” (Mr. Trump actually spoke positively overall about the United Nations, which even many diplomats concede is often ineffective in the face of global conflict, saying he wanted to strengthen the global body. “We’re going to make sure the United Nations is viable,” he said, promising to “help them, moneywise.”) Many major U.S. allies, including western European powers, have declined to join Mr. Trump’s board. They include France, which did not send a representative to Thursday’s event. A spokesperson for France’s foreign ministry complained about the “ambiguity” of the board’s scope, saying that it must “refocus on the situation in Gaza.” But in his remarks at the event, Secretary of State Marco Rubio echoed the idea that the board’s scope was in fact widening. Mr. Rubio said the body was formed because the “Gaza situation was impossible to solve under orthodoxy, under existing structures.” But, he added, “We hope that this can serve as a model for other complex and difficult situations, so they can be solved in the same way.” The event had more than one unusual detour. In addition to Mr. Trump’s endorsement of Mr. Orban, Prime Minister Edi Rama of Albania used his brief speaking slot to denounce the indictment by a special international tribunal in The Hague of Kosovo’s former president, Hashim Thaci, on charges of crimes against humanity committed during Kosovo’s war for independence more than 25 years ago. Mr. Thaci’s indictment was delivered by Jack Smith, a federal prosecutor who was then the tribunal’s chief prosecutor. Mr. Smith later oversaw the Justice Department’s 2023 indictments of Mr. Trump on charges of election interference and mishandling classified documents. Without mentioning Mr. Smith by name, Mr. Rama made sure Mr. Trump was aware of the connection, saying that Mr. Thaci’s indictment was “the doing of the very same sicario prosecutor that went after President Trump himself, and for that became worldwide famous.” Sicario is a Spanish word and Hollywood movie title that can connote thuggishness or criminality.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT After Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States and much of the West all but severed economic ties to Moscow. But since President Trump took office more than a year ago, he has described a “tremendous opportunity” for deals with Russia if the war ends, and the Kremlin has dangled possible investments in front of the famously transactional leader. Now a Texas investor with ties to the Trump family is testing the possibility of making deals with Russian companies, even as the fighting in Ukraine rages on. The investor, Gentry Beach, said that he quietly signed an agreement with one of Russia’s biggest energy companies last fall to develop natural gas in Alaska. Image Gentry Beach in New York in 2018. Credit... Bennett Raglin/Getty Images for GQ Mr. Beach’s deal, which he insisted was motivated by business interests and not politics, shows how Mr. Trump is starting to bring Russia back into the Western economic fold, even as few signs point to President Vladimir V. Putin being ready to stop his assault on Ukraine and U.S. sanctions against Russia remain in place. It also shows how the Kremlin’s messaging about what it says are immense business opportunities in Russia — an aide to Mr. Putin this week put their value at an improbable $14 trillion — is starting to resonate in the United States. “Trump is a transactional president,” Mr. Beach said in an interview. “I don’t think people would have felt as comfortable working with Russian companies during the Biden administration as they do during the Trump administration.” The project is in its early stages and faces steep hurdles, and Mr. Beach declined to disclose the financial details. The Russian company, Novatek, said it was “indeed having negotiations on the potential use” of its technology to liquefy natural gas in remote northern Alaska. But it did not confirm that it was working with Mr. Beach. Image A concrete gravity-based structure, part of Novatek’s Arctic LNG 2 joint venture, under construction near Belokamenka, Russia, in 2022. Credit... Reuters Mr. Beach’s deal could represent the first known instance of an American investor formalizing a new business venture with a major Russian company since the Kremlin started promoting deal-making opportunities to the Trump administration a year ago. Overall, U.S. companies have remained deeply skeptical of doing business with Russia, and the Trump administration imposed significant new sanctions on Russia’s oil industry last fall. But Mr. Trump, despite voicing occasional frustration with Mr. Putin, has often echoed the Kremlin’s talking points, both on Russia’s economic promise and on the idea that President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is standing in the way of peace. He said last week that Russia “wants to make a deal” to end the war, and that “Zelensky is going to have to get moving.” Mr. Beach said he negotiated his deal in meetings in Dubai and Europe last year with Novatek’s billionaire chief executive, Leonid Mikhelson, who is under sanctions in the U.K. and Canada but not in the United States or the European Union. “It’s time for all of us to work together,” Mr. Beach said, describing himself as a “bringer of peace.” Image Leonid Mikhelson, right, the chief executive of Novatek, in Saint Petersburg, Russia, in 2022. Credit... Olga Maltseva/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Mr. Beach, a hedge fund and private equity investor, is a college friend of Donald Trump Jr.’s, the president’s eldest son, and served as a finance vice chairman for Mr. Trump’s 2017 inauguration. His pursuit of deals around the world since Mr. Trump’s re-election has sowed confusion about his ties to the administration and frustrated Donald Trump Jr., The Wall Street Journal reported last fall . Speaking to The New York Times last week, Mr. Beach said the relationship with Donald Trump Jr. played no role in the Novatek deal, and said he did not “do any business with the Trumps on any level.” He said that his effort was not part of the U.S.-Russia talks led by Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s peace envoy. But Mr. Beach also said that “this project is known about at the highest levels” in Moscow and Washington. He said he would soon announce the names of executives who would lead the project. Last August, days after meeting Mr. Trump in Alaska, Mr. Putin said that “we are discussing with our American partners” the possibility of using Novatek technology to produce liquefied natural gas in Alaska. Doug Burgum, the interior secretary, said in October that foreign investors were interested in exporting the gas directly from Alaska’s North Slope. Mr. Mikhelson, one of Russia’s richest men, has kept a low profile since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, but met regularly with Mr. Putin before then, according to the Kremlin’s website. Novatek, which has close ties to the Kremlin but is not state-controlled, is under partial U.S. sanctions, and some of its subsidiaries face more severe restrictions. Mr. Beach said he had been able to legally pursue his deal because the United States did not fully sanction the Novatek parent company itself. Kirill Dmitriev, Mr. Putin’s economic envoy, has pitched a multitude of potential deals to Mr. Witkoff and other interlocutors, including jointly selling gas to Europe and building an undersea tunnel from Russia to Alaska. Many U.S. companies scrambled to pull out of their business dealings with Russia after Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, facing intensifying Western sanctions and political pressure. Under Mr. Trump, that pressure has eased. Last spring, Mr. Trump described Russia’s economic potential as a “tremendous opportunity.” But while the Kremlin was eager to re-establish business ties, Mr. Trump said that major deal-making would only be possible after Russia stopped its war in Ukraine. That is why Mr. Beach’s deal could mark a milestone, especially as the U.S.-mediated Ukraine peace talks drag on. Mr. Beach said he was not waiting to jump into deal-making with Russia, because “the guy that’s early to the opportunity is usually the one I’ve found that makes the money.” Most of the American corporate world, which once saw Russia as a hot emerging market with a growing middle class, remains skeptical about returning to the country because of the political uncertainty and the limited potential gains. Ivan Grek, the director of George Washington University’s Russia program, said that Mr. Beach’s project could be an early test of whether new U.S.-Russia deals are realistic. He said he also saw interest in doing more business with Russia from medical technology, pharmaceutical and consumer goods companies. “Gentry is a pioneer in this case, if not the only pioneer,” said Mr. Grek, who has been convening discussions among officials, businesspeople and academics on economic policy toward Russia. Mr. Beach’s project would tackle an enduring conundrum for the U.S. energy industry: how to sell the huge amount of natural gas produced in the slice of tundra near Alaska’s Arctic Ocean coastline known as the North Slope. But it still faces major obstacles, including securing the participation of larger energy companies that would supply gas to the project. It could also compete with Trump-backed plans for an 800-mile pipeline to send North Slope gas to southern Alaska , where it could be liquefied and exported. Mr. Beach argued that his project would be complementary to the pipeline. The project would echo the approach Novatek has developed for shipping gas from the remote Russian Arctic: turning it into liquefied natural gas in a prefabricated plant and transporting it out by icebreaker. Novatek said in its statement that the climate in the Alaskan Arctic was similar. “Experts have discussed this opportunity for many years,” Novatek’s statement went on. “Having said that, all the arrangements can only be implemented subject to support from the Russian and U.S. authorities.” Mr. Beach described Mr. Mikhelson, the bil",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Democrats have selected Gov. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia to deliver their party’s response to President Trump’s State of the Union address on Tuesday, putting at center stage a former congresswoman who flipped a red seat to blue ahead of midterm elections in which they are expecting to win back control of the House. Ms. Spanberger won the governorship in a purple state last November by 15 points, a victory that buoyed Democrats and offered a glint of hope for the future of a party that has struggled to formulate an effective response to a president unbound. In 2018, she became the first Democrat in 50 years to win Virginia’s Seventh Congressional District , to the north of Richmond. Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, chose her for the response, people familiar with his thinking said, because he believes that her gubernatorial campaign, which focused on affordability and prosecuting the case against Mr. Trump, was a model for how Democrats can win races across the country in November. Ms. Spanberger said she planned to use her speech to address the issues facing Americans at a pivotal moment: “rising costs, chaos in their communities, and a real fear of what each day might bring.” The choice of Ms. Spanberger, 46, a moderate Democrat and former undercover C.I.A. officer , in some ways followed the same playbook the party used last year when they selected Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, a relatively young, centrist female lawmaker with national security credentials, to deliver the response to Mr. Trump’s speech to a joint session of Congress. Unlike Ms. Slotkin, however, Ms. Spanberger is not seen as a potential presidential candidate in 2028. Still, the job of the televised response is often seen as a springboard for an up-and-coming lawmaker to boost his or her political profile. It can also be a delicate assignment, one that has been botched by so many promising elected officials in both parties that it is now considered almost cursed. Senator Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat and minority leader, also announced on Thursday that he had chosen Senator Alex Padilla of California, the first Latino elected to represent his state in the Senate, to deliver the Spanish-language response to the speech. Mr. Padilla, the son of Mexican immigrants, last year was shoved to the ground by federal agents and handcuffed after trying to ask Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, a question at a news conference in downtown Los Angeles.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT In a fiery ruling that accused the government of widespread noncompliance with judicial orders, a federal judge ordered the Homeland Security Department to provide thousands of immigrants detained nationwide with notice that they can join a lawsuit against the government and get either a hearing or be immediately released. If put in place, the 22-page order issued on Wednesday from Judge Sunshine S. Sykes of the Federal District Court for the Central District of California would create a major procedural roadblock for the Trump administration’s mass deportation effort. The order comes as district court judges across the country whose dockets are swamped with petitions from immigrants challenging their detention have been increasingly muscular in their response to the executive branch disregarding their orders, compiling lists of violations and in one instance holding a Justice Department lawyer in civil contempt of court . Judge Sykes, who was appointed by President Joseph R. Biden Jr., criticized the executive branch in strong terms, referring to its “terror against noncitizens,” “unlawful, wanton acts,” and “violence on its own citizens” in killing two Minnesota residents. A Homeland Security Department spokesman responded to the ruling by criticizing “judicial activists.” In a statement, the spokesman said that Immigration and Customs Enforcement “has the law and the facts on its side” and that “it adheres to all court decisions until it ultimately gets them shot down by the highest court in the land.” The ruling was praised by Matt Adams, legal director for Northwest Immigrant Rights Project and one of the attorneys representing the petitioners in the case. He said the ruling “appropriately calls out the D.O.J. for defying the court’s prior orders,” adding that he hoped that the petitioners and other detainees who could benefit from the suit “will now finally receive the bond hearings they are entitled to.” A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment. The government has indicated it plans to appeal Judge Sykes’s rulings. In court, Justice Department lawyers have said that their lapses are unintentional as they struggle to keep up with an overwhelming caseload. The Trump administration has been arresting and detaining immigrants who have settled in the United States after entering the country illegally, a break with the longstanding practice of releasing many on bond . As a result, the federal district courts have been flooded with petitions from detained immigrants who are challenging the legality of the new approach. In her opinion, Judge Sykes dismissed excuses that government lawyers were overwhelmed, noting the flood of work was ultimately driven by the administration’s policies. Officials “have chosen to avail themselves of these exact circumstances of which they now complain,” she wrote. The administration has been repeatedly sued over its practice of holding migrants who have lived for years in the United States without bond. The legal question of whether the detentions are justified turns on whether detainees already inside the United States can be held without bond under a statute that authorizes such detention for “applicants for admission.” But even if that statute does apply, some detainees’ lawyers have argued , they may still be entitled to a hearing under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. Some district court judges and one divided appellate panel from the conservative Fifth Circuit have agreed the administration’s actions were legal. Judge Sykes is among the dozens of federal judges who have ruled against the Trump administration’s interpretation of the law. In December, she issued a broad ruling that the Homeland Security Department’s arrest policy for migrants was illegal. That order was especially significant because she also certified a nationwide class of potential beneficiaries for her ruling: most anyone without a criminal record who had entered the United States illegally and was not immediately detained at the border. After her ruling, the administration’s chief immigration judge, Teresa L. Riley, issued internal guidance for immigration judges, who are part of the Justice Department. She said that they could continue to order migrants to be detained without bond, relying on a September ruling by a different government group, the Board of Immigration Appeals, that justified the detentions. In her ruling, Judge Sykes wrote that administration officials were “shameless” to argue that they were not bound by her earlier ruling. She declared she was vacating the Board of Immigration Appeals ruling, rendering it void, charging that the government had “far crossed the boundaries of constitutional conduct.” “Somehow, even after the judicial declaration of law that the Department of Homeland Security was misguided in its act of legal interpretation,” she wrote, government officials “still insist they can continue their campaign of illegal action.” Judge Sykes ordered the Homeland Security Department to change its website to let detainees know that they could potentially benefit from her class-action ruling. Within seven days, she wrote, the government must give notices of potential class membership to “all noncitizens already in immigration detention,” presented “in a language the noncitizen understands,” an order that would require providing notice to tens of thousands of detained migrants. She wrote that the government must provide “access to a telephone to call an attorney within one hour” of receiving the notice.

Cross/The New York Times Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 4:22 min Learn more Share full article By Shawn McCreesh Shawn McCreesh is a White House correspondent. He reported from Washington. Feb. 19, 2026 President Trump emceed the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace in Washington on Thursday morning. It’s a new international body he created and oversees. Nations willing to pay $1 billion can purchase a permanent seat on the board. The big news out of the meeting was that the president promised the United States would put up $10 billion in aid to Gaza. Where this money would come from or whether it had been approved by Congress, he did not say. White House officials did not respond to requests for comment. Some other nations pledged aid money, too. Beyond that, there were few clear objectives from the meeting. It was like the United Nations General Assembly, if everything about the United Nations revolved around Donald Trump. He told tall tales. Cracked old jokes. Got people to pay money into something he’s named after himself. Hyped up his wife’s movie. Trashed his enemies. Aired familiar grievances. Congratulated himself. Brought along top members of his government and then kicked back while they congratulated him. Image Flanked by world leaders, Mr. Trump cracked jokes, bragged about his wife’s movie and aired familiar grievances. Credit... Tierney L. Cross/The New York Times So much about the meeting was highly unorthodox. To begin with, there was the timing. Mr. Trump was hosting this meeting just as he was moving a mighty array of military hardware into place near Iran. He used his peace summit to threaten all-out war. “Bad things will happen” if Iran doesn’t make a deal with him about its nuclear program, he warned. “You’re going to be finding out over the next probably 10 days.” Also, there was the location. The Trump-led Board of Peace met at the Donald J. Trump United States Institute of Peace (it’s just down the street from the Donald J. Trump and John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts). “Marco named it after me,” Mr. Trump explained about the venue while his secretary of state sat a few feet away. “I had nothing to do with it, I swear I didn’t. I swear. I had no idea.” And there was the very nature of the thing. What is the Board of Peace, really? To see it come together for the first time is to understand it as a manifestation of a Trump World Order. None of America’s old mates wanted anything to do with it. Leaders from Britain, France, Canada, Germany, Norway and other places the president has spent a year insulting stayed away. Their absence was clocked by the peacemeister. “Almost everybody’s accepted, and the ones that haven’t will be,” he claimed. “Some are playing a little cute. Doesn’t work. You can’t play cute with me.” Image Some longtime American allies like Britain, France and Canada were notably absent from the Board of Peace gathering. Credit... Tierney L. Cross/The New York Times There was a funny little note in his voice then. Was it self-consciousness? “The ones that aren’t here are watching on Zoom,” he said. The president had nice things to say about the ones who did want to join his club. “This is the most prestigious board ever put together,” he proclaimed. “You know, I’ve seen some great corporate boards. I’ve seen some great boards, period. It’s peanuts compared to this board.” In the immortal words of Megadeth : Peace sells … but who’s buying? Morocco, Egypt, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Indonesia and Vietnam all accepted invitations to join the Board of Peace. Mr. Trump shouted out some other leaders. “We are honored to be joined by Prime Minister Rama of Albania,” he said. “Where is President Milei?” he asked, spotting the Argentine leader. “Prime Minister Hun Manet of Cambodia, raise your hand, wherever you may be.” Prime Minister Hun Manet raised his hand. “Yeah, hi,” Mr. Trump said. Santiago Peña, the 47-year-old president of Paraguay, caught Mr. Trump’s eye. “Young, handsome guy,” he said. “It’s always nice to be young and handsome. Doesn’t mean we have to like you. I don’t like young, handsome men. Women, I like. Men? I don’t have any interest. Ha, ha.” Capeesh? Image Vice President JD Vance and other top officials joined Mr. Trump onstage. Credit... Tierney L. Cross/The New York Times There was some light U.N.-bashing at this first meeting of the Anti-U.N. “The Board of Peace is going to almost be looking over the United Nations and making sure it runs properly,” Mr. Trump said. He recounted how the last time he spoke at the U.N., his teleprompter was busted and the elevator broke down. And of course, there was venting of grievances about the Nobel Prize. “I got screwed by Norway,” Mr. Trump said. There was a PowerPoint presentation and a video of Gazans interspersed with B-roll footage of Mr. Trump walking around and shaking hands. The president banged a miniature golden gavel, and with that, the first meeting of the Board of Peace was adjourned.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Refugees who were lawfully admitted to the United States could be arrested if they have not yet obtained a green card, a change to previous policy that is the Trump administration’s latest effort to scrutinize immigrants who were approved for status. In a new memo, which was described in court filings on Wednesday, officials at the Department of Homeland Security said immigration agents would be required to detain refugees if they had not applied for legal permanent status after a year of living in the country. Refugees would be “inspected and examined for admission to the United States” after being detained, according to the memo, which was issued on Wednesday by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. It was unclear how long refugees could be kept in detention. According to the memo, they would be confined for “the reasonable length of time it takes” to re-examine their cases. The memo is part of the Trump administration’s broad effort to target refugees and tighten pathways for immigrants to legally enter or remain in the United States. Last month, the Homeland Security Department announced that it would review thousands of refugee cases in Minnesota, requiring them to submit to new interviews and background checks amid a surge of federal immigration enforcement in the state. In the following weeks, at least 100 refugees were arrested in Minnesota and sent to detention centers in Texas for interviews, lawyers, family members and faith leaders said. A federal judge later ordered immigration agents to stop detaining and deporting refugees in Minnesota and to immediately release those held for re-examination of their cases. On Thursday, a federal judge will hear arguments on whether to extend those temporary protections. That judge’s order came after the Trump administration slashed the number of refugees accepted into the country. In October, the administration lowered the ceiling of refugee admissions to 7,500 for this fiscal year, down from the 125,000 cap the Biden administration had set the previous year. Federal officials also said they would prioritize slots for mostly white South Africans . The new policy rescinds an Obama-era memo that had previously determined that a refugee’s failure to apply for legal permanent status within a year was not sufficient grounds to detain or deport them. In a statement, a Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesperson said the agency was enforcing immigration laws that required the federal government to inspect refugees after their first year in the United States. “The memo almost reads like they think they have an obligation to detain refugees who don’t have green cards after one year of being in the United States, which is a wild interpretation because refugees can’t even apply for green cards until after a year,” said Sarah Pierce, a former policy analyst at Citizenship and Immigration Services who is now the director of social policy at the center-left think tank Third Way. “This is just yet another policy that’s being driven by removal numbers.” Ms. Pierce added that the Trump administration’s pause on immigration applications filed by people from countries subject to the president’s travel ban would also make it harder for at least some refugees to obtain green cards. Federal officials said the new directive was necessary to root out people with serious criminal backgrounds, identify those who posed national security risks and ensure that refugees did not fraudulently obtain lawful status. Groups that provide assistance to refugees swiftly condemned the memo, saying it could strip the legal status of immigrants who had already been extensively vetted and welcomed into the United States after fleeing persecution. They also said they expected more refugees to be deported as a result of the efforts. “This government will clearly stop at nothing to terrorize refugee communities, and really all immigrants, while trampling over our constitutional rights,” Laurie Ball Cooper, the vice president for U.S. legal programs at the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in a statement. Immigrant advocacy groups said they expected the directive to largely affect recently arrived refugees. In the 2024 fiscal year alone, more than 100,000 refugees were admitted to the United States, according to data from the Department of Homeland Security.

The Supreme Court ruled Friday that President Trump exceeded his authority when he imposed sweeping tariffs on imports from nearly every U.S. trading partner, a major setback for his administration’s second-term agenda. The court’s 6-3 decision has significant implications for the U.S. economy, consumers and the president’s trade policy. The Trump administration had said that a loss at the Supreme Court could force the government to unwind trade deals with other countries and potentially pay hefty refunds to importers. Mr. Trump is the first president to claim that a 1970s emergency statute, which does not mention the word “tariffs,” allowed him to unilaterally impose the duties without congressional approval. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said the statute does not authorize the president to impose tariffs. “The president asserts the extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope. In light of the breadth, history, and constitutional context of that asserted authority, he must identify clear congressional authorization to exercise it,” the chief justice wrote. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Brett M. Kavanaugh dissented. Early last year, he invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to set tariffs on imported goods from more than 100 countries. He said his goal was to reduce the trade deficit and spur more manufacturing in the United States. Since then, he has used the tariffs to raise revenue and to pressure other countries in trade negotiations. A dozen states and a group of small businesses, including an educational toy manufacturer and a wine importer, sued over the tariffs, saying the president had unlawfully infringed on Congress’s power under the Constitution to impose taxes. The businesses, which rely on imported goods, argued in court filings that the tariffs had disrupted their operations and led to higher prices for consumers and cutbacks in staffing. In court filings and social media posts, the president and his advisers cast the outcome of the Supreme Court case as critical to his trade and foreign policies, making clear he would see defeat as a personal rebuke. Without the emergency power, the solicitor general had warned the justices, there would be economic ruin akin to the Great Depression, in addition to an interruption of trade negotiations and diplomatic embarrassment. But even while battling in court, the president began to explore alternatives to the 1977 law. Mr. Trump’s top trade negotiator Jamieson Greer said last month that the administration would move quickly to replace any emergency tariffs invalidated by the court with other levies. The president has already used other statutes to set tariffs, including national security-related ones on some specific goods and industries. Still, other laws that more clearly afford the president the power to impose duties are more limited and less flexible than the emergency law. Mr. Trump initially set tariffs on goods imported into the United States from China, Canada and Mexico, saying the levies were a punishment for those nations’ failing to stop the flow of fentanyl. In April, he expanded the duties to imports on goods from nearly all trading partners , saying they were needed to address trade deficits with the rest of the world. Under the 1970s-era law, the president has the authority to take certain steps in response to a national emergency to “deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat” to “the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States.” That includes the power to “regulate” the “importation” of foreign property. Past presidents have relied on that language to place sanctions or embargoes on other countries, but not to impose taxes. But the administration has argued that phrase also gives Mr. Trump the power to levy tariffs. The affected businesses countered that the word “regulate” did not encompass the imposition of tariffs. The statute does not include the words “tariffs,” “taxes” or “duties.” During oral arguments in November, several conservative justices sharply questioned the Trump administration’s lawyer about whether Congress had intentionally delegated to the president broad taxing powers, which the Constitution generally reserves for lawmakers. The case reached the Supreme Court after three lower courts concluded the tariffs were unlawful. In August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled 7 to 4 that the emergency statute did not authorize the sweeping tariffs while declining to decide whether the statute might allow Mr. Trump to impose more limited duties. “Whenever Congress intends to delegate to the president the authority to impose tariffs, it does so explicitly,” the appeals court’s majority said.

However, he acknowledged that tariff authorities the administration had tried to use gave Trump more negotiating leverage and suggested that he did not believe that the Supreme Court would interfere with such a central part of the president’s economic agenda.

Cross/The New York Times Starting in December, a growing roster of companies hired lawyers, filed lawsuits or submitted official claims to the U.S. government, all in an early bid to secure a quick payout in the event that the centerpiece of Mr. Trump’s global trade war is struck down. The companies, including the buy-in-bulk retailer Costco and the canned-tuna company Bumble Bee Foods, were racing to get in line for tariff refunds, anticipating that the Supreme Court would rule against President Trump and force him to return billions of dollars collected on imports. Now that they have done so, it is unclear whether the government will have to pay those refunds. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump had warned in stark terms that any ruling that paves the way for tariff refunds could damage the nation’s fiscal health, while still expressing a measure of confidence the White House would win the case. At oral arguments in November, though, the justices were skeptical of the president’s vast assertions of power to tax imports at a whim, stoking suspicions that they could deliver a defining blow to Mr. Trump’s economic strategy. More than $200 billion in tariffs has already been collected since the start of last year. While the Supreme Court offered little indication during the oral argument as to whether it would order such refunds, some businesses started the legal legwork to obtain them anyway, aiming to beat the rush and recover their full tariff costs. Costco, for example, did not indicate how much it had paid in tariffs since Mr. Trump ratcheted up duties last spring. But in a lawsuit, Costco reflected the reality that the financial burden ",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT For five consecutive winters, members of Congress have watched from Washington as Russia’s war has inflicted not only battlefield casualties but also a sustained assault on Ukraine’s civilian lifelines including heat, electricity and water, turning the cold weather itself into a weapon. This week, during a visit to Kyiv and the first congressional delegation to the port city of Odessa, a group of Democratic senators encountered that reality firsthand during the coldest winter since Russia’s full-scale invasion in early 2022. “You see immediately that this is not a frozen conflict for Ukranians,” Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said during her visit. “Almost four years on, civilian infrastructure and energy infrastructure continue to be deliberately targeted.” Ms. Shaheen was joined in Odessa by three other Democratic senators, Chris Coons of Delaware, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. Mr. Blumenthal and Mr. Whitehouse had also stopped in Kyiv earlier in the week. The senators were there not only to demonstrate American solidarity with Ukraine as the war enters its fifth year, but also to press President Trump and his allies in the Republican-controlled Congress for more support for Ukraine and to intensify pressure on Russia in a grinding war of attrition that the Kremlin thinks it can withstand. The Democrats said they were hopeful that Republicans on Capitol Hill were ready to move forward with a tough new sanctions bill that Mr. Trump has been resisting for almost a year and to press the president to furnish more military assistance. Image Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, with Mr. Blumenthal in Ukraine earlier this week. Credit... Robert Jimison/The New York Times “The path to lasting peace runs through sustained pressure on Vladimir Putin,” Ms. Shaheen said, referring to the Russian president. “I am seeing growing bipartisan recognition that Putin is intent on just waiting us out, and that failing to act decisively now will only prolong the war.” Some Republicans have been moving in that direction. “We need for the administration to unleash the Tomahawk missiles,” Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said last week during an appearance in Munich with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. In a social media post, Representative Don Bacon, Republican of Nebraska, criticized Mr. Tump’s lack of action. “The President’s policies towards Ukraine and Russia polls in the low 30s,” he wrote. “Most Americans have moral clarity on who is the invader and who is bombing cities everyday. Americans want this Administration to stand on side of freedom, free markets and rule of law.” Others in the G.O.P. have signaled that they may be ready to move forward with a long-stalled package of economic penalties aimed at the economic engine of the Kremlin’s war machine: energy exports. Republicans backed away from the measure over the summer when Mr. Trump appeared more willing to take consequential action toward Mr. Putin amid a summit with the Russian leader that yielded few results and stalled negotiations. The president imposed sanctions on two large Russian oil companies, but they did not choke off Mr. Putin’s resources as Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill had envisioned. The night before the delegation arrived in Odessa, Russia launched more than two dozen missiles into Ukraine. While air defenses intercepted most, several penetrated, hitting power plants and residential areas. “The frequency and severity of strikes on Odessa and port infrastructure is intensifying,” Mr. Coons said, noting that American business were being targeted and impacted. “It’s open season on American business,” Mr. Blumenthal said. “Nearly half of them have been directly or purposefully attacked. The American people deserve to know that Putin is targeting American businesses.” Mr. Trump, with his “America First” philosophy, has remained opposed to sending American aid to Ukraine. In lieu of the tens of billions of dollars in military aid Congress regularly approved during the Biden administration, he has forged an arrangement in which the United States sells weapons to European allies willing to deliver them to Ukraine. Last week, Norway, Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden announced plans to purchase $500 million worth of Patriot missiles, artillery shells and other munitions from the United States. And on Tuesday, Latvia’s prime minister said her country would buy $11 million of U.S.-made weapons for Ukraine. But some Republicans in Congress are pushing for more. In the House, a Democratic bid to force a vote on a new package of aid for Ukraine is just one Republican supporter short of success. The effort, led by Representative Gregory W. Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, has the support of all Democrats and two Republicans, Mr. Bacon and Representative Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania. A separate effort to force a vote on a sanctions package against Russia began collecting signatures this week. In the Senate, a similar sanctions measure is said to be regaining momentum and could soon be brought to a vote, though Mr. Trump, who has resisted it, has yet to endorse it. “Only by increasing the costs on Russia,” Mr. Coons said, “will they come to the table.” Robert Jimison covers Congress for The Times, with a focus on defense issues and foreign policy.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The Supreme Court on Friday struck down President Trump’s sweeping use of emergency powers to impose many of his tariffs, saying he could not use a decades-old law to tax imports. At issue is a 1977 law that gives the president broad economic powers during a national emergency, known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Mr. Trump has invoked the law to justify import taxes on dozens of trading partners. The court, in its opinion, said that “Based on two words separated by 16 others in Section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA — ‘regulate’ and ‘importation’ — the President asserts the independent power to impose tariffs on imports from any country, of any product, at any rate, for any amount of time. Those words cannot bear such weight.” Mr. Trump used the law in April to levy global tariffs , including on some of America’s closest allies. He issued them by declaring a national emergency over the “large and persistent” trade deficit that the United States runs with the rest of the world. The president said trade deficit — the gap between what America exports and imports — reflected unfair trade relationships that have hollowed out U.S. manufacturing . The president also used the law in February to hit Mexico, Canada and China with levies because he said that they had not done enough to stop the flow of migrants and illegal fentanyl into the United States. Mr. Trump’s tariffs were challenged in court by a dozen states , along with small businesses that argued the import taxes hurt their bottom lines. The challenges reached the Supreme Court after lower courts ruled that the emergency statute did not give the president authority to impose tariffs of that magnitude, but allowed the levies to remain while litigation continued. What is IEEPA? The International Emergency Economic Powers Act gives the president broad powers to regulate financial transactions upon declaring a national emergency. Under the law, presidents can take many economic actions “to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy or economy” of the country. Presidents have used the law to impose sanctions, justify export controls and restrict some transactions and outbound investment, said Kelly Ann Shaw, a partner at the law firm Akin Gump and a former economic adviser to the Trump administration. But legal experts have questioned a president’s authority to use IEEPA to impose tariffs. No president before Mr. Trump used IEEPA to put tariffs on imported goods, according to a recent Congressional Research Service report . Instead, presidents have imposed tariffs in response to national security threats using Section 232 of a 1962 trade law. That legal provision differs from IEEPA because it requires an investigation and report that must be issued within 270 days. The provision also focuses on imports that “threaten to impair” U.S. national security. Congress passed IEEPA to restrict the emergency economic powers granted to the president under the Trading with the Enemy Act , a 1917 law that gave the president expansive authority to regulate international transactions during wartime. President Richard M. Nixon used the precursor statute to briefly impose a 10 percent universal tariff in 1971. Some scholars have questioned whether IEEPA grants the president “unchecked executive authority in the economic realm,” according to the C.R.S. report. Others say IEEPA is an effective foreign policy tool that allows the president to rapidly carry out the will of Congress. “This is a very broad tool that affords the president a lot of latitude to impose potentially really substantial economic costs on partners,” said Philip Luck, the economics program director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former deputy chief economist at the State Department during the Biden administration. “This is a pretty big stick you can use.” How has Mr. Trump used the law? During his first term, Mr. Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Mexico using his authorities under IEEPA. In May 2019, he said that he would use the law to impose a 5 percent tariff on all goods imported from Mexico and gradually increase it to 25 percent unless Mexico alleviated “the illegal migration crisis.” In June 2019, Mr. Trump backed down from the threat after the United States reached an agreement with Mexico to stem the flow of migrants to the southwestern border. Mr. Trump did use the authority, though, to impose sanctions against other countries. Mr. Trump used IEEPA to penalize Venezuela’s state-owned oil company and impair the government of President Nicolás Maduro by cutting off its main source of cash. He also used the law to impose sanctions on Iran in retaliation for what the administration said were aggressive acts by Tehran. In June 2020, Mr. Trump invoked the law to authorize sanctions on top officials at the International Criminal Court after the court opened an investigation into potential war crimes by American troops in Afghanistan. President Joseph R. Biden Jr. later revoked that executive order. How have other presidents invoked IEEPA? In April 2015, President Barack Obama used IEEPA to authorize sanctions against foreign-based hackers targeting the United States. In September 2001, after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush used IEEPA to impede the financial support network for terrorist organizations by authorizing the United States to block the assets of foreign individuals who commit acts of terrorism. As of Jan. 15, presidents had declared 69 national emergencies invoking IEEPA, according to the C.R.S. report . Historically, these national emergencies lasted nearly a decade. Thirty-nine of the national emergencies were still in effect, according to the report. Madeleine Ngo covers immigration and economic policy for The Times.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT President Trump is considering committing the United States to another military campaign against Iran, a decision that carries the risk of igniting a conflict that could prove to be longer, deadlier and far more dangerous than last year’s 12-day war. Last June, the United States joined a campaign against Iran that Israel had begun, and Mr. Trump gave the military a specific goal: to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities and set back Tehran’s ability to one day make a nuclear weapon. Within days of the U.S. strikes, all sides agreed to a cease-fire. There were no American casualties. Now, the Pentagon is in the midst of the largest military buildup in the Middle East in two decades, and Mr. Trump is considering a far more expansive operation — this time led by U.S. forces — without saying publicly what he hopes to achieve. Would a campaign once again be focused on Iran’s nuclear sites? Would there be additional strikes to eviscerate Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal , which Iran has insisted it would not give up through negotiation? Or, could Mr. Trump’s goal be something he has often said was dangerous folly: using the military to remove a government in the Middle East from power? A war for regime change could lead to untold civilian deaths in Iran and a wider conflict across the region. The president told reporters on Friday that he was weighing a limited military strike to pressure Iran into a deal. “I guess I can say I am considering that,” he said at the start of a meeting with governors at the White House. The ambiguity around Mr. Trump’s aims could, according to some U.S. officials and Middle East experts, be particularly dangerous, as it may lead Iran’s government to see an American-led offensive as an existential threat. As a result, Iran could escalate the conflict against the United States and Israel in ways it did not during the attacks last June, or after the U.S. military assassinated Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, in 2020. Vali Nasr, an Iran expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, said there was a risk that Iran could calculate that its muted response to previous American military operations had only invited more threats from the United States, “and that it must escalate the cost of war for the U.S.” In a letter on Thursday to the United Nations secretary general, the head of Iran’s U.N. mission said that if Iran was attacked, then “all bases, facilities, and assets of the hostile force in the region would constitute legitimate targets,” and that the “United States would bear full and direct responsibility for any unpredictable and uncontrolled consequences.” That could put the 30,000 to 40,000 U.S. troops currently stationed at 13 military bases across the Middle East at particular risk. Pentagon officials have been scrambling to move more air defense batteries to the region to protect the bases. Last June, Iran launched a volley of missiles against American troops at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, but Iranian officials privately warned U.S. and Qatari officials in advance. Image U.S. troops listening to President Trump speak at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar last May. The base was attacked the following month. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times This time could be different, as a senior Pentagon official acknowledged earlier this week. U.S. troops could be at much greater risk, he said, if the United States — not Israel — initiates this round of strikes. Israel, of course, could still take on the brunt of any Iranian retaliation. During the conflict last June, Iran launched hundreds of long-range missiles at government, military and civilian targets in Israel. Israeli military officials said they succeeded in intercepting more than 80 percent of the missiles, and yet the barrage still did extensive damage and killed several dozen Israeli civilians. The Iranian missile attacks forced Israel to begin conserving its supply of interceptors, and some Israeli officials in recent weeks have warned that a much longer conflict could strain the country’s ability to defend cities in Israel. Iran faces its own risky calculus if it considers a full-scale retaliation against U.S. troops or Israeli cities, something that would be an “enormous gamble for a regime whose paramount goal is survival,” said Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. It could lead Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to escalate further than originally planned — to make the ultimate goal of the war to bring down Iran’s government. The formidable array of American ships, jets, bombers, drones, surveillance aircraft and air defense units headed to the Middle East is the most tangible evidence that the Pentagon sees the prospect of war lasting beyond 12 days. “This looks like positioning for a much longer conflict,” said Katherine Thompson of the Cato Institute, who was a senior policy official at the Defense Department during the first year of the Trump administration. The Pentagon appears to be “anticipating an Iranian response that could be a significant risk to American bases in the region,” she said.

Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times But even with advanced planning, Ms. Thompson said, the Pentagon is always aware that it has a finite supply of missile interceptors to protect its bases or Israeli cities — and that a protracted conflict could force difficult decisions. “The ability of the United States to sustain a prolonged defense of its forces and basing in the region, while also supporting Israel’s defense, is a major concern,” she said. A second American military official said that U.S. Central Command is keeping two aircraft carriers deployed in the Middle East at a considerable distance from Iran, to protect them from becoming a target. Officials also noted that it was difficult to hit an aircraft carrier traveling at speed with a ballistic missile. In addition, the carriers are escorted by destroyers, which have the ability to shoot down ballistic missiles. Hundreds of troops have now been evacuated from Al Udeid base in Qatar, Pentagon officials said, and there have been evacuations at the cluster of U.S. bases in Bahrain that house the Navy’s 5th Fleet. There are also American troops at bases in Iraq, Syria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. At least publicly, Trump administration officials insist that they remain committed to seeing if there is a diplomatic end to the standoff, one that could see Iran agreeing to new restrictions on its nuclear program. Privately, however, they say it is difficult to see what Iran may offer in the near term that could dissuade Mr. Trump from committing to another military campaign. During his first 13 months in office, Mr. Trump has ordered seven military attacks in other countries, and he has been emboldened by the successful outcome of the military’s most recent operation — the commando mission in Venezuela in early January that captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife and brought them to the United States. Mr. Trump’s confidence is reflected in his blustery rhetoric aimed at Iran, pledging in one social media post in late January that “the next attack will be far worse! Don’t make that happen again.” That day, Iran’s mission to the U.N. responded with a warning of its own. “If pushed,” it said in a statement, Iran “will defend itself and respond like never before!” Tyler Pager contributed reporting.
