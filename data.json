      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT For two decades, few corners of global finance were lonelier than the market for Japanese government bonds. Under the Bank of Japan’s longstanding regime of keeping borrowing costs pinned at zero, yields on the securities, known as J.G.B.s, largely flatlined. Over the years, the few contrarian investors willing to bet that yields might eventually rise were burned so badly that the trade was named the “widow-maker.” In the world’s second-largest government bond market, entire days would pass without a single benchmark bond changing hands. Those days are gone. Last month, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s vow to cut taxes sparked anxiety over Tokyo’s ability to service its staggering $9 trillion debt. Yields on the 30-year government bond surged more than a quarter percentage point in a single session, an enormous move in a market where daily changes are typically measured only in hundredths of a point. The volatility was so profound that Scott Bessent, the U.S. Treasury secretary, called his counterparts in Tokyo seeking reassurances to help steady global markets rattled by the moves. Yields, a benchmark for borrowing costs, jumped again last week after Ms. Takaichi’s party won in a landslide election, which investors viewed as a mandate for her high-spending agenda. For the broader Japanese economy, the spike signals a potentially grim slide. If yields continue their ascent, some economists and investors warn that Japan risks falling into a “debt trap” — a vicious cycle in which rising interest costs consume so much of the national budget that the government must borrow even more just to pay the interest. But for J.G.B.s and their veteran traders, the recent movements have generated a return to a level of fervor not seen in decades. After a prolonged professional hibernation, a rare class of traders and strategists — most now in their 60s or older — are finding themselves back in the limelight as global investment firms seek to tap their experience in navigating an environment of actual, moving interest rates. “It’s becoming a ‘battlefield’ again,” said Hiroyuki Kubota, 67, who dealt Japanese government bonds 40 years ago and has since written several books on the securities. “It’s just like the old days.” Image Hiroyuki Kubota, a veteran of the Japanese government bond market going back decades, said the recent fluctuations in yields reminded him of “the old days.” Credit... Kentaro Takahashi for The New York Times Mr. Kubota began dealing the bonds in 1986, just after a series of reforms meaningfully opened Japan’s government debt markets to global investors. At the time, Nomura Securities, the king of Japan’s bubble-era finance, was hosting boozy, dayslong annual cherry blossom seminars in Kyoto to pitch government bonds to overseas central bankers. The market was booming. In the 1980s and 1990s, yields shifted rapidly alongside fluctuations in Japan’s overall economy. Yields on 10-year bonds doubled from 4 percent in 1989 to 8 percent in 1990, before falling back to 5 percent by 1992. Investors rushed to profit from the swings. After J.G.B. futures — contracts to buy or sell bonds at a later date — were introduced in 1985, they quickly became the world’s most heavily traded bond futures. “It was a party,” said Hiromi Yamaji, 70, chief executive of the Japan Exchange Group, recalling the annual Kyoto gatherings of the 1980s. Before assuming his current post at the operator of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Mr. Yamaji spent 36 years at Nomura. J.G.B.s “were a very lucrative product,” he said. “Everybody was trading them a lot.” At the time, traders were being wooed by the likes of Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers, which were expanding their presence in Tokyo. Top-tier strategists could command compensation packages in the millions of dollars as American firms sought to poach talent from traditional Japanese banks. Mr. Kubota, the former J.G.B. dealer, started a website in the late 1990s featuring a chat room that he said had attracted market movers and officials from Japan’s Ministry of Finance. He hosted annual parties on a traditional Japanese houseboat, where the elite of the bond world would talk shop while cruising the Sumida River in central Tokyo. Recent swings in yields “may have been a shock to those who only knew the last 20 years,” Mr. Kubota said. “But to those who know the old days, they aren’t strange at all.” Image In the years since Mr. Kubota started dealing government bonds in the 1980s, he has become one of Japan’s best-known bond watchers and has written several books on the subject. Credit... via Hiroyuki Kubota Paralysis began to set in for Japanese government bonds around the turn of the century. After the bursting of the Japanese asset bubble and the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the Bank of Japan in 1999 became the first major central bank in recent memory to lower interest rates to zero. As the central bank began buying bonds to force rates down, the 10-year yield hit a record low of less than 0.5 percent in 2003. For two decades, as policymakers kept rates near zero to combat persistent deflation, yields hardly budged. In 2016, they fell below zero, meaning investors were basically paying to hold the bonds. “For many, many years, it was a very difficult market,” the Japan Exchange Group’s Mr. Yamaji said. “Nobody had any interest in trading.” With average daily trading volumes tanking, Japan’s local banks, once the most aggressive traders of government bonds, began to close their trading operations. International groups scaled back as well. Many veterans left high-paying foreign firms like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley. They either “semiretired” or were pushed into less glamorous roles, such as research, at domestic firms, said Yoshiki Kumazawa, a director at Morgan McKinley, a recruitment firm in Tokyo. “We call it ‘juniorization,’” said Mr. Kumazawa, who compared it to shipping a baseball player who once starred for the New York Yankees off to a Japanese team. Mr. Yamaji tried to revive the market throughout the 2010s by introducing new trading methods for the bonds, but the stagnation persisted until 2024. That was when a burst of postpandemic inflation led the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates for the first time in 17 years . This prompted a rise in bond yields. Image Hiromi Yamaji, the chief executive of the group that runs the Tokyo Stock Exchange, remembers when trading Japanese government bonds “was a party.” Credit... Kentaro Takahashi for The New York Times Those yields then spiked higher on Jan. 19, when Ms. Takaichi endorsed a tax-suspension measure estimated to cost more than $30 billion annually. The next day, Japan’s 40-year bond yield broke above 4 percent for the first time since 2007. Some see the surge as an alarming sign that Japan will struggle to finance its debt. Kyle Bass, founder of Hayman Capital Management, a Dallas-based hedge fund, was known in the 2010s for his high-conviction bet that Japanese bond yields would eventually skyrocket as the government’s debt load reached a breaking point, a wager widely dismissed as the ultimate “widow-maker.” He acknowledges that the position did not pay off at the time. Now, with yields rising and Japan’s total debt having risen to a record $8.77 trillion last year, his thesis is becoming harder to dismiss. “The question is: How do they hold it all together?” Mr. Bass said. Borrowing costs are rising in a number of the world’s largest economies. Japan, however, “is about 10 years ahead of everyone in its financial position,” he said. “I’m afraid of the situation they’re in.” For others, the commotion is an opportunity. Average daily trading volumes of J.G.B. futures have surged in recent years, and the number of outstanding positions in the market has reached record highs, according to Mr. Yamaji. Global hedge funds have snapped up top local talent, according to Mr. Kumazawa. Mr. Kubota, the former J.G.B. dealer and well-kn",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT In an opinion heavy on chicken puns, a district court judge ruled on Tuesday that the boneless wings at Buffalo Wild Wings could indeed be called wings. The order, in a lawsuit filed by a Chicago man in 2023, was dripping with skepticism at the claims that the chain was misleading consumers about its boneless wings. Judge John J. Tharp Jr., of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, dismissed the claim by Aimen Halim, saying it “has no meat on its bones.” “Despite his best efforts, Halim did not ‘drum’ up enough factual allegations to state a claim,” Judge Tharp said in his ruling. Buffalo Wild Wings did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for Mr. Halim also did not respond to a request for comment. According to the complaint, Mr. Halim bought boneless wings from Buffalo Wild Wings in Mount Prospect, Ill., in January 2023. Mr. Halim thought he was buying chicken wings that had been deboned, but he soon discovered they were not. Mr. Halim sued Buffalo Wild Wings, saying the chain deceives its customers by labeling its products as “boneless wings,” when the chain instead uses breast meat, which is cheaper. According to the judge’s order, Mr. Halim claimed that had he known the product was not actually deboned chicken wings, he would have paid less or not bought it at all. Buffalo Wild Wings disputed Mr. Halim’s claims, saying that context clues make clear the nuggets cannot be made of wing meat, and that “wing” refers to the style of cooking, not a chicken’s body part. In his order, the judge sided with Buffalo Wild Wings, saying a reasonable consumer would not think that boneless wings were made of wing meat. Judge Tharp noted that cauliflower wings are also sold under the wing section of the restaurant’s menu and as an alternative to traditional wings. “If Halim is right, reasonable consumers should think that cauliflower wings are made (at least in part) from wing meat,” he said. “They don’t, though.” Judge Tharp also said that the menu offered boneless wings at a cheaper price than traditional wings — an indication that the item is not, in fact, deboned. Mr. Halim can amend his claim to try to prove he suffered “economic injury,” but it’s unlikely to be persuasive, Judge Tharp said. He has until March 20 to file an amended complaint. This is not the first time that boneless chicken wings have caused legal action and other drama. The Ohio Supreme Court ruled in July 2024 that a man who ordered boneless wings should have expected the possibility of bones, denying him a jury trial after he suffered serious medical complications from a bone fragment. In 2020, a man in Lincoln, Neb., delivered a passionate plea to his City Council to remove the name boneless wings from menus in the city. And on Reddit, there are hundreds of comments debating the legitimacy of “boneless wings” as a true product, with some carefully explaining how they are different from chicken nuggets. Recipes explaining how to make boneless wings call for a variety of ingredients, but typically begin with a boneless chicken breast.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The U.S. government outlined tens of billions of dollars in planned Japanese investments in the United States as part of a trade agreement struck last year, marking the start of a massive pledge that has faced domestic frictions and financing hurdles. In a statement late Tuesday, the U.S. commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said Japan would provide capital for three projects: a natural gas plant in Ohio, a crude oil export facility along the U.S. Gulf Coast and a synthetic diamond manufacturing site in Georgia. The projects represent a $36 billion commitment and are expected to generate thousands of jobs, Mr. Lutnick said. The energy and manufacturing projects are the first phase of funding under a trade framework agreed in July, under which Tokyo pledged $550 billion in funding to U.S.-based projects. In exchange, the Trump administration agreed to impose a 15 percent blanket tariff on Japanese exports — a reprieve from the more aggressive duties it had threatened. For months, U.S. officials have pressured their Japanese counterparts to move forward with concrete investment plans. For members of the Trump administration, especially Mr. Lutnick, the goal was to maintain momentum after President Trump’s visit to Japan in October. For their part, Japanese officials were eager to show progress before Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s scheduled visit to the United States in March. In an election last week, her party won in a landslide , and Mr. Trump congratulated the prime minister, wishing her success in her “conservative, peace-through-strength agenda.” Around the time of Ms. Takaichi’s visit to the United States, Japanese officials are considering making several additional investment announcements, according to two people familiar with the plans. Japan is aiming to stay out of Mr. Trump’s cross hairs as the country is already feeling the economic ramifications of a prolonged diplomatic dispute with China, Japan’s largest trading partner. Last month, Mr. Trump threatened to raise tariffs on South Korea, saying the country was not moving fast enough to ratify its trade deal with the United States. Japan “understood there needed to be demonstrable progress,” said William Chou, a Japan expert and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a think tank. Without Japan’s investment announcements, “it was uncertain what Trump would have done — whether that was threatening a 25 percent tariff or firing off a few tweets,” Mr. Chou said. “Vibes are good between Trump and Takaichi, so why risk the unknown?” In a post on social media on Tuesday, Mr. Trump hailed the investments. “America is building again,” he wrote, adding that the projects “could not be done without one very special word, tariffs.” During a news conference on Wednesday in Tokyo, Japan’s trade minister, Ryosei Akazawa, said that each project would “promote the economic and national security interests” of both countries. Japanese companies would also benefit by supplying equipment for the projects and their related facilities, he added. Almost all of the spending in the first round of investments is slated for the construction of a natural gas power plant in Portsmouth, Ohio. The $33 billion facility is expected to be the largest natural gas power plant in the world, according to U.S. and Japanese officials. Japanese companies that have expressed interest in supplying the facility include Toshiba, Hitachi, Mitsubishi Electric and SoftBank Group, Mr. Akazawa said. In the months since Mr. Trump’s Tokyo visit, progress on how the $550 billion would be employed had been fitful. Debates have simmered in Japan over how to mobilize such vast sums of capital. Questions have been raised about the plan for the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, a state-owned lender, to serve as the primary financing vehicle for the commitment. Mr. Akazawa, who previously led Japan’s tariff negotiations with the United States, has consistently framed the investments as a “win-win” for both countries. Yet a different sentiment prevails within some business and state-backed finance circles, where the projects are often described as “strategic but less than bankable.” Japan’s investment decisions have also been complicated by an impending Supreme Court decision, expected in the coming months, about whether Mr. Trump exceeded his authority in using a 1970s law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs on dozens of U.S. trade partners. For Japan and many other nations, the threat of tariffs was a key motivator to pledge investments in the United States. That remains true even as officials, including those in Japan, seek to portray the investment decisions as purely strategic, according to David Boling, a principal at the Asia Group, a strategic advisory firm. “Would they be doing this normally? Probably not,” Mr. Boling said. But for Japan, keeping the U.S.-Japanese trade relationship in a good place is clearly the priority, he added. Strategic or not, he said, “there are other more compelling reasons to be doing this.” Hisako Ueno and Tony Romm contributed reporting.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Goldman Sachs is taking another step away from the diversity mandates the Wall Street firm had long championed. Goldman will no longer explicitly consider race, gender and sexual orientation when evaluating a potential board member at the firm, according to two people with knowledge of the bank’s decision who were unable to discuss it publicly because of the confidential nature of the move. The decision is a result of a deal that Goldman struck with the National Legal and Policy Center, a conservative nonprofit group that has been pressuring numerous companies to drop diversity, equity and inclusion mandates, the people said. The group recently announced similar deals with American Express and the equipment manufacturer Deere & Company. As part of its agreement with Goldman, the National Legal and Policy Center, which has a small investment in the bank, withdrew a shareholder proposal demanding that diversity criteria for the board be dropped. The deal was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal. Goldman’s move is part of a broader retreat by corporate America to shun diversity mandates during the Trump administration. The White House claims many of these initiatives amount to discrimination against white workers and job applicants. For years, Goldman’s chief executive, David Solomon, had been a vocal champion of the bank’s commitment to overhauling its traditionally white, male-dominated work force. In March 2019, Mr. Solomon, his top deputy John Waldron and the firm’s chief financial officer at the time, Stephen M. Scherr, declared diversity and inclusion “a top priority.” “When we unite around a common goal, we make progress together,” the men wrote in an email to the staff . They said they would “improve each year” toward goals that included a new recruiting class comprising “50 percent women, 11 percent Black professionals and 14 percent Hispanic/Latino professionals in the Americas, and 9 percent Black professionals in the U.K.” The next year, Mr. Solomon said Goldman would no longer take a company public in the United States or Europe unless it had at least one “diverse” board member. By 2021, a company would need at least two diverse board members in order for Goldman to agree to work on its initial public offering. But since President Trump returned to office, the political and legal winds on diversity have shifted, and Goldman’s commitment to D.E.I. has shifted, too. Last year, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission began questioning the hiring practices at elite law firms, claiming that their efforts to recruit Black and Hispanic lawyers may have potentially discriminated against white candidates. More recently, the agency said it was investigating “systemic allegations of D.E.I.-related intentional race discrimination” against white employees and job applicants at Nike. The sportswear company said it had been complying with the E.E.O.C.’s inquiry. Even before Mr. Trump began his second term, some diversity initiatives were facing legal scrutiny. In late 2024, a federal appeals court said Nasdaq’s rules that set racial and diversity targets for boards that listed on its exchange were invalid. Last February, Goldman said it would drop the policy that required boards of directors of U.S. companies to include women and members of minority groups if the bank was to serve as an underwriter on their initial public offerings. The same month, the firm scrapped the explicit goals it had earlier set for the racial and gender makeup of its recruiting classes. “It doesn’t change our strong belief that successful boards benefit from diverse backgrounds and perspectives,” a Goldman spokeswoman, Jennifer Zuccarelli, said of the recent moves. Goldman’s board is expected to move forward with the change to the diversity criteria for potential board members when it meets this week, the two people with knowledge of the matter said. The meeting will be the board’s first since it convened last week to consider the resignation of Goldman’s general counsel , Kathryn Ruemmler, who said she was stepping down after revelations emerged about her extensive relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. At the bank’s annual shareholder meeting last year, the National Legal and Policy Center’s associate director, Luke Perlot, praised Goldman for having “taken meaningful steps to roll back its D.E.I. programs.” Still, he proposed that the bank eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion goals around compensation for its named executive officers. On that point, the bank’s board recommended against dropping those compensation goals, and fewer than 5 percent of shareholders voted in favor eliminating them.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Revelations about ties to Jeffrey Epstein have toppled leaders of corporate America, Hollywood and academia as the Justice Department has released millions of documents and images from the disgraced financier’s files in recent months. But the Trump administration has steadfastly repelled such fallout, dismissing any associations that top officials had with the sex offender as trivial. The White House’s fortress mentality was mobilized last week after Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, acknowledged that he had traveled to Mr. Epstein’s private island and had another encounter with him years after Mr. Lutnick claimed to have cut ties with him. Such associations have led to the resignations of business leaders, but President Trump’s White House was unfazed. The stark contrast underscores the murky nature of who is deemed to be complicit and who is not when it comes to Mr. Epstein, and the Trump administration’s ability to repel even the most harsh public scrutiny. Despite bipartisan calls for Mr. Lutnick’s resignation, the White House dismissed concerns about his character and credibility. “Secretary Lutnick remains a very important member of President Trump’s team, and the president fully supports the secretary,” Karoline Leavitt, White House press secretary, said last week. Mr. Lutnick’s comments during Senate testimony contradicted his assertion on a podcast last year that he had been so disgusted by Mr. Epstein during a 2005 visit to his townhouse that Mr. Lutnick never set foot in a room with Mr. Epstein again. Mr. Lutnick’s name appeared in more than 250 documents in the Epstein files released by the Justice Department, a review by The New York Times found. He said that he first met Mr. Epstein when they became neighbors in Manhattan in 2005, but that they met only twice more over the next 14 years that he could recall. However, at the Senate hearing Mr. Lutnick confirmed that he and his family traveled to the island in 2012 for a lunch with Mr. Epstein during a vacation aboard his yacht with his wife, children, nannies and another family. The visit took place four years after Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida to soliciting prostitution from a minor as part of a deal with federal prosecutors. Mr. Lutnick is not the only prominent Trump administration official who has appeared in the Epstein documents. The records showed that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, once went hunting for dinosaur fossils with Mr. Epstein. An email in the files showed that Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, invited Mr. Epstein to a 2016 Valentine’s Day party. The Trump administration’s muted response is a striking departure from that of corporate America. Thomas J. Pritzker, a billionaire heir to the Hyatt Hotels fortune , stepped down from his role Monday as executive chairman of the Hyatt Hotels Corporation. Last week, Casey Wasserman, a Los Angeles entertainment executive and chair of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics whose name recently surfaced in the Epstein files, said he had started the process of selling the talent agency he founded more than two decades ago. And last year, Harvard started a new review of ties that its former president Lawrence H. Summers and others at the institution had with Mr. Epstein. After the release of emails between Mr. Summers and Mr. Epstein in November, Mr. Summers said he would step back from public commitments . “Corporate America, they answer to a board,” said Gene Grabowski, a Washington-based crisis communications expert. “Trump doesn’t answer to a board.” Mr. Grabowski added: “The closest thing he has is the voters, and he either doesn’t want to believe the polls or thinks he can reverse them.” A poll conducted last month by The New York Times and Siena University showed that Mr. Trump’s lowest approval rating within the Republican Party came on his handling of the release of files related to Mr. Epstein: Only 53 percent of Republicans approved of his handling of that matter. Mr. Lutnick’s ties to Mr. Epstein pale when compared with those of Mr. Trump, who socialized regularly with Mr. Epstein in the 1990s and 2000s . Using a proprietary search tool, The Times identified more than 5,300 files containing more than 38,000 references to Mr. Trump, his wife, his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, and other related words and phrases in the latest batch of emails, government files, videos and other records released by the Justice Department. Mr. Trump has downplayed his association with Mr. Epstein and accused Democrats of concocting conspiracy theories about their friendship. The president said last summer that he had ended his relationship with the financier because Mr. Epstein had “hired away” spa attendants at Mar-a-Lago. In defending Mr. Lutnick, the White House is again pushing the boundaries of its ability to weather a controversy that might have hobbled other administrations. “This administration has placed all its chips on the idea that the public will eventually tire of controversy, and now they’re betting that even allegations tied to pedophilia fall into that same bucket,” said Alexandra LaManna, who served as a spokeswoman in the Biden administration. “That’s a category of accusation that, historically, has been politically and morally radioactive.” Noting that Mr. Lutnick vacationed on Mr. Epstein’s island, she added: “It’s hard to imagine any president other than Trump trying to shrug that off.” Alan Rappeport is an economic policy reporter for The Times, based in Washington.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT This obituary was originally published on Feb. 17, 2001. It is being republished for a package for Women’s History Month. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Rose Freedman, the last survivor of the Triangle Shirtwaist fire in which 146 of her co-workers perished in 1911, died on Thursday in her apartment in Beverly Hills, Calif., her daughter said. She was 107. Mrs. Freedman, who at the time of the Manhattan fire was two days shy of 18, escaped death in 1911 by following company executives to the roof to be rescued. She became a lifelong crusader for worker safety, telling and retelling the story that the Triangle workers died because the owners were not concerned with their welfare. The disastrous factory fire, in which girls and young women leapt from eighth- and ninth-story windows, their flaming skirts billowing in the wind, horrified the nation and led to some of the first city, state and federal laws dealing with workers’ safety. It gave a powerful impetus to the fledgling labor movement, greatly strengthening the building of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, which two years before the fire had led a three-month strike to focus attention on conditions in workplaces like the Triangle factory. The union’s successor, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, confirmed that Mrs. Freedman, who was Rose Rosenfeld at the time of the fire, was the last survivor to die. The next-to-last, Bessie Cohen, died two years ago. Mrs. Freedman’s life after the fire was colorful and courageous. In World War I, she saved the life of a spy in Austria. After her husband’s death, in 1959, she went back to work to support her three children, two of whom had polio. Lying about her age, she worked at a Manhattan insurance company until she was 79. Mrs. Freedman, who always wore high heels, celebrated her centennial by attending Spanish classes in a Mexican town with cobblestone streets, but refused to abandon her heels for more sensible shoes. “I’d look matronly,” she said. Her involvement in the fire never left her consciousness, and she appeared at labor rallies for the rest of her life. She always expressed rage that the factory doors had been locked, either to keep workers at their machines or to prevent them from stealing scraps of cloth. She always told of how one of the owners tried to bribe her to say the doors were not locked. She refused. The owners were eventually acquitted of manslaughter charges when the jury could not establish whether they had ordered the doors locked or had even known they were. But in 1914, civil suits brought by relatives of 23 victims ended with payments of $75 to each of the families. On the day of the fire, Mrs. Freedman escaped the inferno by stopping to consider what the executives were doing. She somehow thought they would be safer, and went up to the 10th floor, where their offices were, to find out. They were taking the freight elevator to the roof, where firefighters pulled them to the roof of an adjacent building. She did the same. The alternative was jumping. “Girls in shirtwaists, which were aflame, went flying out of the building so that you saw these young women literally ablaze flying out of the windows,” she said in a Public Broadcasting System documentary, “The Living Century,” shown in December and January. As she was taken down the steps of the adjacent building, she stopped on each stoop to sit down and cry. “When I came in the street, here comes my father,” she recalled. “He collapsed. He fainted. And I didn’t go back to work anymore. I went to college.” The anger about what she saw as the owners’ greed persisted. In the documentary, she said: “That’s the whole trouble of this fire. Nobody cares. Nobody. Hundred forty-six people in a half an hour. I have always tears in my eyes when I think. It should never have happened. The executives with a couple of steps could have opened the door. But they thought they were better than the working people. It’s not fair because material, money, is more important here than everything. “That’s the biggest mistake — that a person doesn’t count much when he hasn’t got money. What good is a rich man and he hasn’t got a heart? I don’t pretend. I feel it. Still.” Rose Rosenfeld was born on March 27, 1893, in a small town north of Vienna. Her family ran a profitable business importing and exporting dried foods. After her father visited New York and fell in love with it, the family began spending more and more time in the United States, finally emigrating in 1909. They sailed on the Mauretania. With Mrs. Freedman’s father devoting most of his time to Jewish studies, the business was run by her mother. An aunt who lived with the family once sharply criticized the young woman’s housecleaning abilities. “You call this work?” she demanded. Mrs. Freedman’s response was to go out the next day and take a job at the Triangle factory. Since her language skills were good — she eventually spoke seven languages — she was given the prestigious job of operating a large machine to attach buttons to the blouses. Her only close friend at the factory, a forewoman, died in the fire. She attended college in New York, although family members are not sure where. When she and her mother took a trip to their Austrian hometown to show Mrs. Freedman’s grandparents that she was really alive, World War I had broken out, and the Russians had invaded Austria. Her grandfather had befriended a man who turned out to be a Russian spying against his own country for Austria. She told of hiding him by burying him in coal in the basement, then talking the pursuing Cossacks into leaving without a search. After returning to New York, she got a job with Cunard, the steamship line. In 1927, she married Harry Freedman, an American she had first met at the American Club in Vienna. He owned a typewriter store in New York. They had three children. When the two youngest were stricken with polio, Mrs. Freedman asked when they would be able to walk. The doctor said, “Five years.” She replied, “I have time.” Mr. Freedman died at 59, leaving Mrs. Freedman no money or source of income. She got an accounting job at the Manhattan Life Insurance Company. Her youthful appearance enabled her to say she was 50, when she was actually 64. “Of course it was a lie, but they didn’t know it was a lie,” she said. She worked until she was 79. In 1995, she moved to Los Angeles, where her son Robert and her daughter, Arlene March, live. There, she became such an avid fan of the Lakers that she became livid if someone phoned while a game was being shown on television. On her 100th birthday she was presented with a team jersey bearing the number 100. She exhibited paintings at the Beverly Hills Art Fair, and continued to paint almost until her death. She had her hair and nails done weekly, and shopped and cooked for herself. Mrs. Freedman was still attending Spanish language classes at 107. “To me, 106 is a number,” she said in the documentary. “I lived that long, not only on account of my genes, but on account of my attitude. You’ve got to stand up for yourself. Am I right?” Other survivors are another son, Herbert, of Rye Brook, N.Y., eight grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. She was overjoyed at the great-granddaughter’s birth, and always advised the child’s mother, her granddaughter, Dana Walden, who is president of 20th Century Fox Television, not to get caught in grief when loved ones died. “Sadness takes years from you,” she said. Her own passing ends a chapter of history. Steven Latham, director of the documentary, suggested it was something like the last Holocaust survivor dying. “This is the last voice of an event,” he said. “This woman actually smelled the smoke.” Share full article Related Content Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Bayer, the German pharmaceutical and biotech giant, said Tuesday that it had reached an agreement that would pay plaintiffs $7.25 billion to settle tens of thousands of lawsuits that claimed the weedkiller Roundup caused non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The agreement was submitted to a Missouri circuit court judge in St. Louis, and approval is not guaranteed. A $10 billion settlement unraveled in 2020 after a judge objected to how future claims would be handled. The latest deal would cover both current and future claims, and create a fund that Bayer would pay into over the next 17 to 21 years, according to a company statement. Bayer executives hailed the agreement as a significant step in the company’s efforts to control costs from litigation against Roundup, which Monsanto developed in the 1970s. Bayer acquired Monsanto in 2016. Since then, the company has set aside $10 billion to settle lawsuits over the herbicide. With this settlement, Bayer’s legal costs would approach $14 billion in total, according to Bayer’s statement. Bill Anderson, Bayer’s chief executive, previously said the company would stop manufacturing Roundup, which farmers around the world use to kill weeds and increase crop yields, if it couldn’t find a way to end the lawsuits. “Today marks an important milestone for the company,” Mr. Anderson said on a call announcing the settlement. Shares of Bayer rose more than 7 percent after the announcement. A major factor in driving the settlement is an upcoming Supreme Court case that will decide whether federal law shields Bayer from many Roundup-related lawsuits. Most of the lawsuits against Bayer have been filed in state courts, arguing that the company violated state labeling laws because it did not warn users that Roundup could cause cancer. Bayer argues that the Environmental Protection Agency has found Roundup to be safe and that, according to federal labeling standards, it should be protected from the more than 40,000 active lawsuits, of 170,000 total, that have been filed against the company. Ensuring that those suing received some compensation before the Supreme Court ruling was paramount. “If Monsanto prevails, many claims nationwide would be dismissed or curtailed,” said Christopher Seeger, one of the plaintiffs’ lawyers. If the settlement is approved, it will not be affected by the outcome of the Supreme Court case. Mr. Anderson, the Bayer chief executive, said the settlement “complements” the Supreme Court case, even though many of the cases that Bayer is settling could be invalidated if the justices rule in its favor. He said this agreement and a Supreme Court win would provide “the tightest possible form of containment” of litigation, by settling existing cases and making future cases easier to win. Bayer has played legal Whac-a-Mole since it acquired Monsanto, settling tens of thousands of suits against Roundup before reaching a trial. But a number have gone to trial and resulted in verdicts of hundreds of millions of dollars for a single case. Many of those awards have been reduced on appeal.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Stephen Colbert said on his late-night show on Monday that his network, CBS, barred him from airing an interview with a Democratic candidate for a U.S. Senate race because of new guidance from the Trump administration about equal airtime for political candidates. It’s the first time that a late-night talk show has changed its programming to meet the demands of that update from the Federal Communications Commission, which has over the last year ramped up its efforts to crack down on the major media companies for perceived bias. Mr. Colbert, a frequent critic of President Trump, made it clear he did not make the change willingly. Over six minutes on Monday’s edition of “The Late Show,” Mr. Colbert blasted Brendan Carr, the chairman of the F.C.C. And, in a rebuke of CBS, Mr. Colbert said that “because my network clearly doesn’t want us to talk about this, let’s talk about this.” Mr. Colbert said that CBS lawyers had told him “in no uncertain terms” that an interview he had planned for Monday’s show with State Representative James Talarico of Texas would not air on the show, even though the lawmaker was already in Mr. Colbert’s studio. Early voting began on Tuesday in the Texas primary election, where Mr. Talarico is competing against Jasmine Crockett to be the state’s Democratic nominee to run against Senator John Cornyn, a Republican. Mr. Colbert pointed to new guidance from the F.C.C. from January, warning media companies that talk shows carried on local broadcast networks were required to offer equal airtime to candidates competing for the same office. CBS pushed back on Mr. Colbert’s version of events on Tuesday, saying the network had “not prohibited” the interview from airing but that it instead “provided legal guidance” that broadcasting the interview could trigger the F.C.C. equal-time rule. CBS said it then presented the show “options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled.” There has long been an exemption to the F.C.C.’s equal-time rule for “bona fide news” programming, such as evening news programs. Media companies have long taken it as a given that late-night shows qualified for the same exemption, particularly after the F.C.C. ruled in 2006 that interviews on “The Tonight Show With Jay Leno” were considered bona fide news. After the F.C.C. issued its new guidance, Mr. Carr underscored that was no longer the case. “For years, legacy TV networks assumed that their late-night & daytime talk shows qualify as ‘bona fide news’ programs — even when motivated by purely partisan political purposes,” he said on X last month. “Today, the F.C.C. reminded them of their obligation to provide all candidates with equal opportunities.” Representatives for the F.C.C. and Mr. Colbert declined to comment. Mr. Trump has repeatedly lashed out against many late-night hosts since he returned to the White House last year — just this weekend, he insulted Bill Maher, the HBO talk show host, in a post on Truth Social. Mr. Carr has taken particular aim at late night and daytime television shows that he believes are biased. Last year, ABC removed “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” from its airwaves for almost a week after Mr. Carr suggested that the administration could punish the network because of remarks the late-night host had made in a monologue. Earlier this month, the F.C.C. started a probe into ABC’s “The View” because of an interview with Mr. Talarico, Fox News reported . On Monday’s show, Mr. Colbert repeatedly criticized Mr. Carr, at one point saying that he looked like a “smug bowling pin,” and saying that he believed Mr. Carr was “motivated by partisan purposes.” “Let’s just call this what it is,” Mr. Colbert said. “Donald Trump’s administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV because all Trump does is watch TV.” Mr. Colbert went on to say that he and Mr. Kimmel were “two of the people most affected by this threat” because they had promptly criticized the new guidance when it was announced last month. Because the equal-time provisions apply only to broadcast airwaves, Mr. Colbert announced his interview with Mr. Talarico would be posted to his show’s YouTube page, though he said that network lawyers told him not to give out a URL or a QR code to the link. That interview had more than 1.7 million views on YouTube early Tuesday afternoon, significantly more than the 93,000 views of a video of Mr. Colbert interviewing Jennifer Garner, who was also a guest on Monday’s episode. The F.C.C.’s lone Democratic commissioner, Anna Gomez, said on Tuesday that CBS’s refusal to air the interview was “another troubling example of corporate capitulation in the face of this administration’s broader campaign to censor and control speech.” Mr. Colbert is in his final months hosting “The Late Show,” which will go off the air in May. CBS has said that the show’s cancellation was “purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night,” but many have continued to speculate that the network removed the show for political reasons. CBS’s parent company, Paramount, is also competing with Netflix to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery. Any deal would require the blessing of the federal government.

Billy Barraclough for The New York Times Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 3:36 min Learn more Share full article 6 By Katie Robertson Feb. 17, 2026 Adam Baidawi recalls being enthralled by GQ magazine the first time he pored through an issue as a teenager in suburban Melbourne, Australia. Some two decades later — and on the other side of the world — Mr. Baidawi will now take the helm of the men’s magazine as its next global editorial director. Condé Nast, the publisher of GQ and other brands like Vogue and The New Yorker, on Tuesday announced Mr. Baidawi’s promotion to the top job, effective immediately. Mr. Baidawi, 35, who led British GQ and was the deputy global editorial director, will now oversee all of GQ, including its U.S. publication and its global editions, as well as the music publication Pitchfork , which was folded into GQ in 2024. He replaces the longtime GQ editor Will Welch , who announced in January after a run atop the masthead that he was leaving to move to Paris to work with Pharrell Williams, the musician and men’s creative director for Louis Vuitton. Mr. Baidawi’s appointment is the latest shake-up of the top editorial ranks at Condé Nast, which in recent months has promoted a new generation of internal talent. In June, Mark Guiducci , the 37-year-old creative director of Vogue, became the top editor of Vanity Fair. And last fall, Chloe Malle , 40, the editor of Vogue’s website, succeeded Anna Wintour as American Vogue’s top editor. (Ms. Wintour, 76, remains Vogue’s global editorial director as well as the chief content officer for Condé Nast.) Mr. Baidawi, who is Iraqi Australian, started his career as a music writer and wrote freelance articles for the Australian edition of GQ. He spent a year as an Australia correspondent for The New York Times before spotting a job advertisement looking for someone to launch GQ Middle East. He was named the editor in chief of GQ Middle East in 2018 at age 28, making him the youngest-ever editor in chief of a GQ edition.

Billy Barraclough for The New York Times In 2021, Mr. Baidawi became the deputy global editorial director of GQ and the head of editorial content of British GQ. In an interview from London, Mr. Baidawi said he wanted to restore GQ “to its rightful place as the North Star of masculinity” and to have the magazine be “more participatory in the cultural and political debates of our time.” Mr. Baidawi added that while there was a lot of hand wringing currently about the online “manosphere” and toxic masculinity, the current counterprogramming amounted to lectures and earnestness. “I’m curious to propose a version of masculinity that is yes, progressive, yes, modern, but is also sexier and cooler and more aspirational and more desirable than some of the nihilism or cruelty or vanity that we see out there,” he said. Mr. Baidawi also said he planned to incorporate more long-form video and long-form audio into the GQ brand. In a statement, Ms. Wintour described Mr. Baidawi as “a cultural thinker at a time when the culture needs to be thought through, and even interrogated a little.” “This is someone GQ’s readers can expect to challenge received wisdom — about modern masculinity and the worlds of celebrity, sport and fashion — and have a lot of fun doing so,” she said. Mr. Baidawi will relocate to New York, and his first print issue of GQ will publish in September. Katie Robertson covers the media industry for The Times.

Ricardo Nagaoka for The New York Times In today's newsletter: Paramount notches a win More Epstein files fallout Anthropic’s latest fight with Washington Goldman’s latest retreat on diversity Andrew here. Hope you enjoyed the long weekend. Today, Lauren Hirsch dives into Warner Bros. Discovery restarting merger talks with Paramount and explains what would make it walk away from a deal with Netflix. We also examine Goldman Sachs’s reported decision to drop a diversity requirement for its board. And we look at more fallout from the Epstein files. Paramount notches a win Paramount has sought for weeks to force Warner Bros. Discovery back to the M.&A. negotiating table. On Tuesday, it has finally received a chance to win the battle over the movie and television studio. Warner Bros. Discovery just said that it would restart merger talks with Paramount , giving its suitor roughly a week to make its case to abandon its deal with Netflix. Warner Bros. Discovery isn’t definitely switching sides. Its deal agreement with Netflix gives it the right to talk with a rival bidder if that is likely to lead to a “reasonably superior offer.” Warner Bros. Discovery doesn’t think that’s the case here — but Netflix has given it until Feb. 23 to talk with Paramount to clarify several questions about that company’s competing offer. For now, Warner Bros. Discovery’s board is still recommending that shareholders vote in favor of the Netflix offer. Netflix added in a separate statement: “This does not change the fact that we have the only signed, board-recommended agreement with W.B.D., and ours is the only certain path to delivering value to W.B.D.’s stockholders.” But Paramount has made headway in casting doubt on that. The rival studio has argued that its bid — a deal for all of Warner Bros. Discovery, instead of the more complicated structure of the Netflix transaction, which involves spinning out the Warner cable networks — offers more certainty for shareholders. It doesn’t hurt that a Paramount representative has said the company would raise its takeover price to $31 a share if the Warner Bros. Discovery board authorized talks, and suggested that the company could pay even more. (Paramount has already tossed in sweeteners such as offering to cover the Netflix deal’s $2.8 billion breakup fee and to pay Warner Bros. Discovery a quarterly “ticking fee” if its deal closes behind schedule.) And several Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders, including the hedge funds Ancora and Pentwater Capital Management , have pushed the studio operator to reopen talks with Paramount. (Warner Bros. Discovery has now set March 20 as the date for an investor vote on the Netflix offer.) Big questions remain: How much higher would Netflix be willing to raise its offer for any counterbid? Worth noting: Shares in the streaming giant rose this morning, after having fallen since clinching a deal for Warner Bros. Discovery. How would Paramount finance a higher takeover bid, given that Warner Bros. Discovery has expressed concern about how much debt it already plans to use ? HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING The Fed weighs moves to bolster bank lending. The central bank is preparing to ease capital requirements for U.S. banks , a vice chair, Michelle Bowman, announced on Monday. Banks have seen their share of mortgage originations in the U.S. fall to 35 percent in 2023 from 60 percent in 2008, Bowman said. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has blamed capital regulations for driving lending to nonbank financial services companies. California and Britain strike a clean energy deal. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an agreement on Monday that calls for the two sides to bolster efforts to collaborate on green tech and invest in clean energy. It comes as the Trump administration has dismantled some legal protections for climate and Biden administration initiatives to advance a low-carbon transition. President Trump called the deal “ inappropriate .” The Fed, earnings and inflation data top investors’ agenda this week. Minutes from the central bank’s January meeting are set for release on Wednesday, offering clues about policymakers’ thinking on interest rates. Walmart, Wayfair and Klarna report quarterly results on Thursday, providing more insight on the state of the consumer. The Personal Consumption Expenditures report, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, is scheduled for publication on Friday. Image More Epstein files fallout The Jeffrey Epstein files continue to jolt corporate America , including Hollywood. The heat is also growing in Washington and academia . The latest: Thomas Pritzker, a scion of the Hyatt Hotels empire, stepped down on Monday as executive chairman of the hotels giant, after the files revealed that he was in regular contact with the convicted sex offender in the years after Epstein’s 2008 plea deal on sex crimes charges. Pritzker and Epstein corresponded frequently as they arranged appointments, including visits to Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse. In a 2018 email exchange, Pritzker agreed to help Karyna Shuliak, Epstein’s girlfriend, arrange a trip to Southeast Asia. After Shuliak told Pritzker she was going there “to try to find a new girlfriend for Jeffrey,” Pritzker responded with a smiley-face emoticon and wrote, “May the Force be with you.” Pritzker said in a statement released on Monday that he had “exercised terrible judgment in maintaining contact with” Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s longtime companion. “There is no excuse for failing to distance myself sooner,” he added. Pritzker, a cousin of JB Pritzker, a Democrat and the governor of Illinois, also said he would not seek re-election to Hyatt’s board in May. And then there’s Casey Wasserman. The sports and entertainment mogul, whose decades-old flirtatious messages with Maxwell appeared in the files, is facing increased pressure to step down as chairman of LA28 , the organizing committee for the Olympics in Los Angeles. Karen Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles, on Monday became the highest-ranking elected official to call on Wasserman to resign from LA28. “I do think that we need to look at the leadership,” she said after criticizing the Olympic organizers’ decision last week to back Wasserman. Wasserman announced on Friday that he had begun the process of selling the Wasserman Group , his powerhouse talent agency that has experienced some high-profile defections since the latest Epstein revelations. “I’m deeply sorry that my past personal mistakes have caused you so much discomfort,” he wrote to employees. In related news, some politicians in Ohio have begun distancing themselves from Les Wexner . Wexner, the billionaire founder of L Brands and an early patron of Epstein, had been a major donor to several local races there. Attorney General Pam Bondi’s combative congressional testimony last week over the Epstein investigation continued to draw anger from the right. Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, said he had lost confidence in Bondi days after some right-wing political commentators called for her resignation . Anthropic’s latest fight with Washington Anthropic’s stated focus on safety has set it apart in the artificial intelligence race — and drawn the ire of some White House officials. A new report suggests that the Trump administration is weighing a move that could deal the A.I. start-up a big blow, underscoring a major disagreement between the two sides on how to deploy the technology. The Pentagon is threatening to cut ties with Anthropic, and more, Axios reports . More specifically, the Defense Department is considering designating Anthropic a “supply chain risk,” meaning that other military contractors would have to stop working with the company, too. It’s a designation typically reserved for overseas adversaries, Axios adds. The threat aris",

Paramount will have until Feb. 23 to negotiate its best and final offer. Warner Bros. Discovery last year rejected Paramount’s offer to buy the entire company for $108 billion in favor of a deal to sell only its streaming and studios business to Netflix for $83 billion. Warner Bros. Discovery said at the time that Netflix offered the better deal for shareholders. Paramount disagreed and quickly made its case to shareholders through a hostile bid . In the roughly two months since then, Paramount has amended its offer twice , each time addressing some of the concerns that Warner Bros. Discovery’s board had raised. Paramount’s chief executive, David Ellison, has also raised questions about the Netflix bid, including whether its deal can pass regulatory scrutiny. Some Warner Bros. Discovery investors, including Pentwater Capital Management, have also raised concerns, encouraging the company to restart talks with Paramount. Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Skydance were both up about 3 percent in premarket trading. To date, Paramount has not publicly raised its offer from $30 a share. But last week, Warner Bros. Discovery said that a senior representative for Paramount had verbally informed a company board member that, if the board authorized talks with Paramount, it would agree to pay $31 a share. In that conversation, the Paramount representative added that it would be willing to further improve its offer. “It’s about time the actual headline price bidding heated up in what has to be one of the most inactive corporate bidding wars in history,” Eric Talley, a business professor at Columbia Law School, said. In a letter to the Paramount board on Tuesday, David Zaslav, the chief executive of Warner Bros. Discovery, and Samuel A. DiPiazza Jr., chairman of the company, said: “We welcome the opportunity to engage with you and expeditiously determine whether PSKY can deliver an actionable, binding proposal that provides superior value.” In Paramount’s latest offer, it agreed to pay the $2.8 billion fee Warner Bros. Discovery would owe to Netflix if their agreement were terminated, as well as agreeing to back Warner Bros. Discovery’s debt costs. Paramount also said it would pay Warner Bros. Discovery’s shareholders around $650 million in cash, starting in 2027, for each quarter that the deal did not close. Warner Bros. Discovery said Tuesday that it had requested a number of clarifications about Paramount’s latest proposal. Among them were concerns about the extent of Paramount’s support for Warner Bros. Discovery’s debt costs and the conditions under which Paramount could legally walk away from a deal. It also wanted assurances that Paramount would be willing to contribute more equity if its debt financing fell apart. According to the terms of Warner Bros. Discovery’s contract with Netflix, it can engage in talks with a rival bidder if it thinks it can lead to a “reasonably superior offer.” Warner Bros. Discovery said in its letter on Tuesday that it did not yet think that Paramount’s offer met that bar — but that Netflix had given Warner Bros. Discovery a seven-day waiver to see if it could clarify its concerns. “Throughout the robust and highly competitive strategic review process, Netflix has consistently taken a constructive, responsive approach with WBD, in stark contrast to Paramount Skydance,” Netflix said in a statement released on Tuesday. “While we are confident that our transaction provides superior value and certainty, we recognize the ongoing distraction for WBD stockholders and the broader entertainment industry caused by PSKY’s antics.” On Tuesday, Paramount acknowledged Warner Bros. Discovery’s decision, saying in a statement that it had opted to secure a waiver rather than deeming Paramount’s bid as one that could be reasonably expected to be superior. In doing so, Paramount said, Warner Bros. Discovery did not allow itself “an unfettered right to negotiate without a time deadline.” “Although the board’s actions are unusual,” the statement said, “Paramount is nonetheless prepared to engage in good faith and constructive discussions.” If Paramount makes a superior offer, Netflix has the right to improve its own bid. Shares of Netflix have been under pressure since it announced the deal in December, falling about 15 percent this year. Its stock rose 1.5 percent in premarket trading. Discovery said on Tuesday that it had scheduled a shareholder vote on Netflix’s offer for March 20. Lauren Hirsch is a Times reporter who covers deals and dealmakers in Wall Street and Washington.

Eric Lee for The New York Times Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 11:29 min Learn more Share full article 485 By Tony Romm Reporting from Washington Feb. 17, 2026 Shortly after returning to office, President Trump embarked on an aggressive campaign to pare back the core functions of the federal government, unveiling a budget that proposed some of the steepest spending reductions in U.S. history. Nearly one year later, Congress has rejected much of that vision. In a little-noticed development, lawmakers have systematically brushed off many of Mr. Trump’s most severe cuts for this fiscal year, leaving intact a vast set of federal education, health, housing and research programs that the White House had tried to slash or eliminate. For Mr. Trump, the result is a set of annual government expenses that do not appear radically different on paper compared with what he inherited in January 2025. Overall, Congress is on track to approve more than $1.6 trillion in discretionary spending for 2026, amounting to little change from the previous fiscal year, according to a preliminary analysis of federal budget records by the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan research organization.

Targeting primarily domestic programs, Mr. Trump had originally recommended about $163 billion in deep spending cuts . But lawmakers often did not abide, and in the end, some of the funding that the president had tried to erase — including for medical research, college aid and benefits for poor people — instead changed only slightly, the data show. Mr. Trump still prevailed in other ways, most notably in his efforts to scale back the size and reach of government by ousting thousands of federal workers. Still, the outcome on Capitol Hill underscores the complex and fraught politics of austerity: Where the president sees evidence of spending that is woke, weaponized or wasteful , his critics in both parties see money that is essential to their communities and the broader economy. At times, the difficult dynamic has put the White House at odds with some congressional Republicans, many of whom are up for re-election this November. That has only reinforced Mr. Trump’s desire to circumvent lawmakers altogether, using a series of contested and potentially illegal maneuvers to revoke billions in congressionally approved spending that the president disfavors. Kent Smetters, the faculty director for the Penn Wharton Budget Model, said that, for now, Congress had “basically rejected” everything that Mr. Trump had sought. By law, the White House must send Congress a budget by the first Monday in February — a deadline that presidents from both parties have regularly missed without consequence. The administration is expected to release its latest blueprint for the 2027 fiscal year as soon as next month. Still, Mr. Smetters added that the result this year illustrated a well-worn truth that presidential budgets are “aspirational in nature,” and that in the fight to trim spending, there are always “strong vested interests” for keeping federal funds intact. To come to the preliminary budget estimates, The New York Times analyzed spending across the 11 appropriations bills adopted by Congress, primarily using early data furnished by Democrats on the Senate Appropriations Committee and a set of outside groups, including Penn Wharton. A final, 12th bill, covering homeland security, has not yet passed. Top Republican appropriators did not respond to requests for comment. The analysis focused primarily on domestic spending, not defense, which Mr. Trump has increased considerably in his first year back in office. He secured some of that military funding as part of his sprawling tax legislation, which was paid for in part by cutting back benefits in programs like Medicaid and food stamps. In effect, the changes broke with a long-running tradition in Washington to treat defense and domestic spending with parity, a development that the administration sees as one of its signature victories. The White House nonetheless maintains that it has meaningfully changed the nation’s fiscal trajectory during Mr. Trump’s second term. The administration has already moved to shutter entire agencies and revoke billions in spending previously authorized by Congress. That includes rescinding about $14 billion that lawmakers adopted for foreign aid and public broadcasting last year. Some of the cuts, including federal support for the organization that funds NPR, were sustained by Congress in recent months, which helped to lower the overall amount spent by the government in 2026, according to officials at the White House budget office, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe their thinking. “The appropriations bills, reconciliation, rescissions, all the different tools we are using — it’s the end of futility,” Russell T. Vought, the director of the budget office, said in a statement, referring to the legislative processes that allowed Mr. Trump to enact his tax legislation and repeal past spending. Image President Trump’s budget proposed some of the steepest spending cuts in U.S. history. Credit... Kenny Holston/The New York Times Marc Goldwein, the senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said that the president’s actions in his first year in office carried mixed budgetary implications. On one hand, he said the Trump administration did not “get a big nominal cut in spending” in Congress for the 2026 fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30. But Mr. Goldwein, whose group supports deficit reduction, said the White House did manage to ward off perennial spending increases for domestic programs, which still amounted to a “big victory.” Last spring, for example, Mr. Trump took his first steps to try to dismantle the Education Department, where he and his aides froze funds and either fired or reassigned staff members without congressional approval. Yet Democrats and Republicans adopted a funding deal in late January that provisioned $79 billion for the agency, a slight increase from 2025, the data show. They also rejected some of the president’s ideas, including his attempt to sharply reduce funding for Pell grants, which aid low-income college students. At the White House, officials said they still believe that they can proceed with their attempts to dissolve the department and relocate its staff this year, arguing that the new funding legislation did not explicitly prevent them from doing so. Lawmakers similarly rejected steep cuts proposed by Mr. Trump for agencies including the Departments of Commerce, Labor and Health and Human Services, which saw only slight changes to their overall, annual budgets, the records show. And they jettisoned some of Mr. Trump’s most significant attempts to whittle down antipoverty programs, particularly federal housing assistance. The president initially proposed overhauling — and halving — the funding for a stable of benefits that includes housing vouchers, which serve about 2.4 million low-income households . But Congress did not weigh his proposed restructuring. Instead",

      "content": "The vague messages of San Francisco’s billboards have become a fixture of the A.I. boom as more start-ups raise funds and demand attention. Credit... Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 4:13 min Learn more Share full article 2 By Natallie Rocha Visuals by Minh Connors Reporting from San Francisco Feb. 17, 2026 If you had to ask whose forehead was plastered on a billboard along San Francisco’s Route 101 last month, you were clearly not in the start-up world. The large ad, declaring “Target Marc on TV,” was among a smattering of head-scratching billboards by Vibe, a New York-based advertising technology start-up, that put the insider culture of tech on full display. The forehead alluded to one of the tech industry’s most well-known investors, Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Another nearby wallscape showed just a leather-clad shoulder, a nod to Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chip maker Nvidia, who is known for his fondness for black motorcycle jackets . A billboard for Elon Musk, the Tesla mogul who also owns the social media network X, pictured a kitchen sink — a nod to a viral video of Mr. Musk carrying a sink into Twitter’s office in 2022 with the caption “let that sink in.” Image The forehead of the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen can be quickly spotted by a subset of tech industry insiders. Vibe’s campaign, which ran through January, was playing a tech industry insider game: targeting a tiny audience of tech investors and influencers who would get the joke and — just maybe — try to find who was behind those billboards. And while other ad campaigns have forced Bay Area residents to decode tech lingo, Vibe’s billboards took obscurity to a new level of microtargeting. “These are people that everyone in the Valley wants to talk to,” said Arthur Querou, chief executive of Vibe, which creates targeting and analytics software for companies to run advertisements on streaming services. Mr. Querou said one of Vibe’s products offered an advertising algorithm to place streaming ads in front of specific people, like executives in a particular region. That’s why, he said, the recent billboards nod to Silicon Valley celebrities who clients may want to “target” on TV. “It’s very recognizable,” Mr. Querou said of the ad campaign. “Of course, a lot of people in S.F. will not understand the joke, but the people we want to talk to do get the joke.” Image The “Jensen” in question is Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia who often wears black leather jackets. There are billions being invested in San Francisco’s start-up scene right now, and a lot of that money will go toward marketing. Mr. Querou hopes his analog ads will lead start-ups to put some of that cash toward streaming ads with his firm. Advertising on a San Francisco billboard or wallscape can cost anywhere from $15,000 for a downtown ad to the low six figures for prime signage along Route 101 for about six weeks, said Christopher Tavlarides, president of Capitol Outdoor, which owns about 30 billboards across the Bay Area. Mr. Tavlarides said the demand for ad space had increased over the past year, especially for billboards near certain tech offices or venture capital firms. But for those who aren’t in on the joke, the deluge of tech ads have become white noise. “To be honest, it’s too vague for me, and I feel that’s the point,” said James Markert, looking up at a brick wall that said “Target Tim on TV” next to a bitten red apple. The “Tim” in question was Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple. Image Another billboard refers to Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple. Mr. Markert, a bartender in the city’s Jackson Square neighborhood, said he had no idea what “Tim” this ad was targeting. While Vibe’s billboards have gone viral online, Mr. Querou said he was “a bit sad” to not have heard from the tech executives they called out yet. Representatives for Apple, Nvidia and SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment. Image One of Vibe’s billboards was inspired by a 2022 video of Elon Musk carrying a sink during his takeover of Twitter. Still, Mr. Querou received plenty of texts from friends he went to college with at the University of California, Berkeley. Some of them now work in San Francisco as engineers at big tech companies, not start-ups, and sent him pictures of the billboards. But they still didn’t know whom the “Marc” ads were targeting, he said. Danielle Jing, who works at a start-up down the block from the Jackson Square Apple ad, didn’t get the joke. She squinted up at the wallscape on her walk back to the office on a recent evening and said it must just be for “online tech people.” But the forehead billboard along Route 101? She said she immediately knew that reference because she used to work in venture capital. Mr. Andreessen, the owner of that viral forehead, did not respond to a request for comment.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT For nearly 20 years, Anderson Cooper has had a rare double billing in the TV industry: anchor on CNN and correspondent for “60 Minutes,” the celebrated newsmagazine on CBS. Now, he’s back to being a solo act. On Monday evening, Mr. Cooper said he was leaving “60 Minutes” to spend more time with his two young sons “while they still want to spend time with me.” “Being a correspondent at ‘60 Minutes’ has been one of the great honors of my career,” Mr. Cooper said. “I got to tell amazing stories, and work with some of the best producers, editors and camera crews in the business.” After juggling his jobs at CNN and CBS with the demands of raising two boys, Mr. Cooper said, he wants “to spend as much time with them as possible.” Mr. Cooper’s departure will be a blow for “60 Minutes,” where he has been a contributor since 2006. Over the years, Mr. Cooper, 58, has become one of the program’s most recognizable journalists, winning Emmy Awards for his coverage of sexual assault in the Democratic Republic of Congo and for a story about an unlikely group of Grammy-nominated musicians in Malawi’s Zomba Prison. In a statement, CBS News said it was thankful that Mr. Cooper had “taken ‘60 Minutes’ viewers on journeys to faraway places, told us unforgettable stories, reported consequential investigations and interviewed many prominent figures.” “We’re grateful to him for dedicating so much of his life to this broadcast, and understand the importance of spending more time with family,” the statement said. “‘60 Minutes’ will be here if he ever wants to return.” “60 Minutes” has come under scrutiny recently because of tensions between its on-air correspondents and Bari Weiss, the recently appointed editor in chief of CBS News. The program itself became a story late last year after Ms. Weiss made a last-minute decision to hold a segment about a prison in El Salvador over the objections of Sharyn Alfonsi, the veteran “60 Minutes” correspondent who covered the story. Ms. Weiss said the piece needed more reporting; Ms. Alfonsi said the decision was motivated by politics. The story eventually ran with minimal changes. Ms. Weiss later said in a town-hall meeting with employees in January that she had no desire to repeat “that specific logistical nightmare,” of pulling a story so close to broadcast, ever again. In recent years, Mr. Cooper’s career has encompassed much more than TV news. He has written several books, most recently a historical biography chronicling the wealthy Astor family. (Mr. Cooper is a scion of another Gilded Age dynasty, the Vanderbilts.) He also hosts a podcast about grief and bereavement, “All There Is,” which explores loss with in-depth interviews. Mr. Cooper’s departure was earlier reported by Breaker, an email newsletter. Benjamin Mullin reports for The Times on the major companies behind news and entertainment.

Haiyun Jiang/The New York Times Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 15:18 min Learn more Share full article By Ana Swanson Ana Swanson has written about international trade for over a decade. She reported from Washington. Feb. 16, 2026 On Jan. 26, 2025, Jamieson Greer was teaching Sunday school to a group of 9-year-olds when one of his phones started blowing up with calls from the White House. Six days into the new administration, President Trump was already deploying his favorite weapon: the threat of crippling tariffs to bend countries to his will. This time, the president was threatening Colombia, after it refused to accept U.S. military planes of deported immigrants. Mr. Greer would not join the Trump administration for some time yet, but he was already a key adviser on trade, flying to Mar-a-Lago in the weeks before to help plan Mr. Trump’s agenda. “Why do you have two phones?” a student asked him. “I have a kind of crazy job,” Mr. Greer replied. As the United States trade representative, Mr. Greer, 45, has been a powerful but behind-the-scenes force in transforming the global economy. His calm demeanor is often overshadowed in a cabinet filled with outspoken, brash billionaires. Yet few have done more in Mr. Trump’s second term to put into practice the president’s vision of altering the system governing how trillions of dollars of goods move around the world. Mr. Greer has provided the legal and policy framework to overhaul a global system Mr. Trump slams as unfair. He has helped the president raise tariffs to their highest levels in nearly a century while simultaneously leading negotiations with all of America’s biggest trading partners. So far, he has helped Mr. Trump reach initial trade arrangements with dozens of countries. Interviews with Mr. Greer make clear that he is a true believer in Mr. Trump’s plan to use tariffs to revitalize the United States manufacturing sector. He and other advisers have ushered in steep import taxes to try to protect manufacturers from foreign competition, coax more factories into the United States and create more good-paying factory jobs. “What the president has done is amazing,” Mr. Greer said in an interview in January. “He has restructured global trade.” It’s not yet clear those initiatives will work. Manufacturing employs less than 10 percent of Americans, and the number of factory workers has been dwindling. While some manufacturers support protectionism, others say it raises their costs and makes U.S. industry less competitive. Consumers are also concerned about tariffs increasing prices , and polls show Mr. Trump losing support for his handling of the economy. Though Mr. Greer credits the president’s tariff threats with giving him leverage in negotiations, Mr. Trump’s penchant for brinkmanship has clearly added uncertainty and complications to how countries deal with the United States. Mr. Trump has continued to threaten countries with tariffs, even if they have already agreed to trade deals, leaving companies unsure how permanent his policies are. This year seems likely to bring more tumult, as the Supreme Court reviews whether to overturn many of these tariffs. The administration is also preparing for high-stakes meetings with China, and negotiations with Canada and Mexico that could transform or dissolve the North American trade deal. Mr. Greer is often seen as a source of stability in the chaos. A former Mormon missionary and military lawyer, he has quietly navigated the demands of an unpredictable president, other big personalities in the cabinet, and the dozens of foreign leaders and company executives whose fortunes are tied up in trade. Friends say he has followed the advice of his mentor and former boss, Robert E. Lighthizer, who served as the U.S. trade representative in Mr. Trump’s first term: “You can get a lot done in Washington if you don’t care who gets the credit.” Mr. Greer’s small agency has only about 250 people, and he has not always been included in important administration decisions. In April, as he was testifying before Congress to defend the global tariffs Mr. Trump had just announced, the president surprised lawmakers and Mr. Greer by suddenly pausing them. But those close to Mr. Greer say he has built a solid relationship with the president. Mr. Trump has turned to him to coordinate issues beyond trade, like investment and security deals with Saudi Arabia, Cambodia and Thailand. Mr. Greer said that while he may not be a billionaire or political celebrity like other officials, he was chosen for a simple reason: “I know my brief.” Reading ‘Les Mis’ in Mortaritaville Image Mr. Greer during his time serving as a military lawyer in Iraq, where he was stationed at a base known as “Mortaritaville.” Credit... via the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative Mr. Greer is known as being preternaturally calm, a trait that some who know him say stems from being the father of five children. He credited his time as a military lawyer in Iraq, where he had to pause cross-examinations to shelter under a desk from mortar fire. “Listen, as long as nobody’s bombing me, I’m in good shape,” he said. Mr. Greer’s membership among Washington’s elite was not predictable. Raised in a working-class family in Paradise, Calif., he grew up in a mobile home, the fourth of five children, and worked during the summers and school year as a dishwasher and at McDonald’s. His parents valued education and Mr. Greer was drawn to the yellow-trimmed National Geographics that arrived in the mail each month. He attended Brigham Young University and served for two years during college as a Mormon missionary in Belgium, France and Luxembourg. In a white shirt and tie, Mr. Greer spent his days speaking to locals and refugees from Kosovo and Rwanda, an experience that opened his eyes to international relations and taught him fluent French that he still uses in trade negotiations. At B.Y.U., Mr. Greer joined the military and met his future wife, Marlo. After law school in Virginia and a stint studying in Paris, he served as a military lawyer in Kansas, Turkey and Iraq, where he was stationed at a base nicknamed “Mortaritaville,” reading “Les Misérables” in French between bombardments.

Rod Lamkey/Associated Press He was set on a path toward his future role as the architect of Mr. Trump’s trade strategy by what he called a “serendipitous” interview with Mr. Lighthizer for a job in Washington at the law firm Skadden Arps. Mr. Lighthizer said Mr. Greer impressed him as someone with “brains and values,” and hired Mr. Greer in 2012 to help the firm defend U.S. Steel and other American companies in trade cases. That work gave Mr. Greer an advance look at what U.S. industries would face in the coming years, as Chinese exports heavily subsidized by Beijing flooded global markets. Jeffrey Gerrish, who worked with Mr. Greer at Skadden Arps and at the trade representative’s office, said Mr. Greer was “right on the front lines” as Chinese goods began decimating U.S. industry. “He saw the kinds of impacts that it was having, not only on the companies, but on the workers and really entire communities,” Mr. Gerrish said. Mr. Greer saw the influx of cheap goods as a national security issue, but few Republicans or Democrats agreed. That changed with Mr. Trump’s election in 2016, when Mr. Lighthizer became U.S. trade representative and appointed Mr. Greer as his chief of s",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Mothers of young children surged into the work force during the Covid-19 pandemic, propelled by a tight labor market, federal child care subsidies and the sudden abundance of remote jobs. Years later, they are still on the job. The share of women with children under 5 who are working or looking for work peaked at nearly 71 percent in September 2023 and continues to float above prepandemic levels, according to an analysis of government data from the Hamilton Project , an economic policy research group at the Brookings Institution. The growth is partly because more employers have flexible office policies, an enduring legacy of the pandemic era. More jobs are at least partly remote, so parents — especially mothers who often shoulder most of their families’ child care duties — can better balance their responsibilities as employees and caregivers. This is particularly true for highly educated women in white-collar jobs. There is probably also a bleaker catalyst for the elevated labor force participation among mothers with young children, some economists believe: More women feel they must earn a paycheck to afford family life . “It’s not something to be proud of,” said Kathryn Anne Edwards, a labor economist and policy consultant. “If anything, it just reflects that they might be more desperate for money.” For families across the country, the cost of living has become an escalating challenge . Grocery prices have increased more than 25 percent over the past five years. Many Americans are straining to pay for health care, education and housing. Child care prices in most states have increased more than twice as fast as prices overall, according to the Century Foundation , a left-leaning think tank. The financial pressure may be compelling more mothers of young children, who generally work less than other women in their prime working years, to enter and remain in the labor force. Hiring in January was stronger than expected , the Labor Department reported on Wednesday. Kelsey Whitlatch, a mother of two in Moundsville, W.Va., left her job as a hairstylist in October 2023, a month before her second son was born. A year later, she got a job at a day care, but it closed soon after. Ms. Whitlatch, 28, said she considered not working to focus on her children, who are now 5 and 2. But her husband, a bridge inspector for the state, does not make enough money to support their family on his own, especially with the rising costs of groceries and utilities. During months when she wasn’t working, her family relied on food stamps and struggled to pay bills. She fell so behind on payments for her car that she worried it would be repossessed. “We were going under so bad,” she said. She now brings home about $400 a week taking care of a handful of children along with another mother who had worked at the day care. She also has a business, Sugar Mommas Cottage Home Bakery, that sells cookies and elaborately frosted cakes. “Every day I’m grateful — I know we could definitely be way worse,” she said. “I’m glad we’re at least sustaining, to some extent.” Image During months when Ms. Whitlatch wasn’t working, her family relied on food stamps and struggled to pay bills. Credit... Rebecca Kiger for The New York Times Mothers of young children have a lower labor force participation rate than other women for many reasons, including a lack of affordable child care and caregiving duties that are in tension with work schedules. Women who drop out of the labor force tend to do so around the time when their children are born, and rejoin when their children are older and parenting responsibilities are less consuming. The labor force participation rate for mothers with children ages 5 to 12 was about 77 percent at the end of last year. But being a stay-at-home mother for any amount of time is possible only if a family can live on one income. That arrangement appears increasingly out of reach. More than 70 percent of Americans last year said raising children was unaffordable, according to the American Family Survey , an annual poll of 3,000 Americans. “What is noticeable is just how widespread this concern is,” said Chris Karpowitz, a political science professor at Brigham Young University and one of the survey’s authors. “Americans of all stripes are worried about the cost of raising kids.” Poorer families are being squeezed even harder by slower wage growth, persistent inflation and rising child care costs, said Corinne Low, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of “Having It All: What Data Tells Us About Women’s Lives and Getting the Most Out of Yours.” That, coupled with a downshift in hiring, has made many families more reliant on second “flex” earners to pick up the slack. “One of the things that means is families might not be able to afford not having Mom in the labor market,” she said. Other factors keeping more women with young children in the labor force include a change in employers’ expectations about where work is done. White-collar professions are often more conducive to remote-work arrangements, and many companies have become less strict about in-person work. That has allowed some women to set office schedules that align more with child care hours. Women have also benefited from a boom in the health care industry, which has powered employment growth. More than 40 percent of the 2.8 million jobs created from November 2023 to November 2025 were held by women in health care and social assistance, according to an Indeed Hiring Lab analysis of government data. Roles such as nursing, though often in person, have set shifts that allow mothers to more reliably anticipate their child care needs, Dr. Low said. “It works for women because it is structured and it is predictable and it has strong boundaries,” she said. Efforts are underway in New Mexico, New York City and elsewhere to make child care more accessible, which could bolster the labor force participation rate for mothers with young children. Yet a shortage in affordable child care is a prevailing obstacle. Pandemic-era child care subsidies have expired. The federal government is trying to freeze roughly $10 billion in funding for child care and social services destined for New York, California, Minnesota, Illinois and Colorado, which are all led by Democrats. And evidence is emerging that the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown is shrinking the supply of child care workers, worsening the problem.

Credit... Lily Brooks for The New York Times Cameron Hulin, 28, lives in Youngsville, La., and has a 3-year-old daughter. She and her husband, an electrician, have cut down their expenses but are still struggling to pay roughly $550 a month to send their daughter to preschool. They have been trying to sell their house and downsize, but have not had any luck. With another baby on the way, Ms. Hulin and her husband decided it made sense for her to become a stay-at-home mother rather than pay for child care for two children. She plans to leave her job in child advocacy at a nonprofit in May, when her daughter’s program ends for the summer. “It’s hard stepping away from something I enjoy,” she said. But she added, “My purpose is going to be fulfilled still, being there with my kids.” Sydney Ember is a Times business reporter, covering the U.S. economy and the labor market.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT President Trump has frequently claimed that foreign countries were paying for his tariffs, not Americans. But as economists predicted, that is largely turning out not to be the case. Research published on Thursday by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Columbia University suggests that, through November 2025, 90 percent of the economic burden of the president’s tariffs fell on U.S. companies and consumers. The economists reviewed the “incidence” of the tariffs — who ultimately pays the cost of new import taxes . When a good is brought into the country, the importer of record, often an American company, is first responsible for paying the tariff to the U.S. government. But the importer can pass that cost on to others by raising the prices it charges its customers, or by negotiating more favorable contracts with its suppliers. Mr. Trump and his advisers have said the cost of tariffs would be shouldered by foreign suppliers. They believed that foreign companies would respond to tariffs by reducing their prices, to maintain their access to the large and important U.S. consumer market. In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal on Jan. 30 defending his tariffs, Mr. Trump wrote, “the data shows that the burden, or ‘incidence,’ of the tariffs has fallen overwhelmingly on foreign producers and middlemen, including large corporations that are not from the U.S.” “In many cases, nations that are heavily dependent on exports have had no choice but to ‘eat’ the tariffs to avoid even worse losses from their excess capacity,” he added, appearing to incorrectly interpret some statistics. Although data shows foreign suppliers react to tariffs by reducing their prices in some instances, economic research suggests that is not the most common response. The New York Fed study found that, from January 2024 to November 2025, the bulk of the tariff costs fell on U.S. firms and consumers. In the first eight months of 2025, 94 percent of the tariff incidence was borne by the United States, they said. “In sum, U.S. firms and consumers continue to bear the bulk of the economic burden of the high tariffs imposed in 2025,” the study found. The same researchers studied the effect of tariffs in Mr. Trump’s first term, where they found that tariffs in 2018 and 2019 were wholly passed on to American businesses and consumers. Businesses across the country have spent the last year trying to navigate Mr. Trump’s changing tariff policies. Larger companies have generally been able to handle the higher import duties without raising prices significantly on consumers. In some cases, their size helped them to negotiate discounts with suppliers who rely on their business, helping to offset the cost of the tariffs. Because they often have a more diversified roster of suppliers, they could more easily shift production to countries that carried lower tariff rates. China’s share of U.S. imports — which slumped when Mr. Trump waged a trade war on the county in his first term — fell further last year. But U.S. imports from Mexico and Vietnam increased to help make up the difference. But many bigger companies stockpiled inventory before the tariffs took effect, allowing them to keep prices relatively stable. Some have also accepted smaller profit margins in the hopes that the Trump administration would reach more favorable trade deals eventually. For smaller businesses, tariffs have been a bigger drag . Many did not have the clout to arrange deals with foreign suppliers. Because they typically operate with smaller profit margins, they couldn’t swallow the additional expenses for long. Some had to raise prices on consumers or risk going under. Still, the impact of tariffs has been smaller than many economists anticipated, in part because many companies feared that raising prices would drive away customers. Tariffs have lifted prices on some imported goods, but for the most part, prices have not ballooned. Who bears the brunt of the tariffs could evolve. Many companies delayed some shipments as they worked through pre-tariff inventory, pushing off the tariffs’ costs and allowing them to defer some decisions about how to manage the additional duties. As stockpiles become depleted, avoidance will no longer be an option. The researchers at the New York Fed found that foreign suppliers started to bear a greater proportion of the tariff costs by the end of the year, likely as U.S. companies began renegotiating their contracts. Still, in November, 86 percent of the tariff cost was still passing through to the United States. Over the year, the average tariff rate on U.S. imports rose to 13 percent from 2.6 percent, the economists said, spiking in April and May as Mr. Trump applied tariffs to exports from foreign countries, including China. Their findings imply that, overall, U.S. import prices for goods rose 11 percent because of the tariffs. Ana Swanson covers trade and international economics for The Times and is based in Washington.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT President Trump’s seizure of Venezuela’s oil and his on-again, off-again vows to acquire Greenland , by force if necessary, have underscored the new threat that Washington poses to nations’ sovereignty. The land and resource grabs have alarmed even once-close allies, compelling them to consider other, less obvious risks. The most pointed stems from American dominance over the global financial networks and technology systems that undergird nearly every purchase or exchange of information made by citizens, businesses and governments. Allies are concerned for their financial independence and the security of confidential national data. The risks may be harder to visualize than crashing through a nation’s border and carting off its valuable crude. But they have revived efforts, particularly in Europe, to strengthen control over these critical, though unseen, sources of autonomy and power. European leaders have stepped up their push to reduce reliance on big American tech firms like Amazon, Google and Microsoft for cloud computing, and on financial services titans like Mastercard and Visa for payment systems. The move to secure what are being labeled monetary sovereignty and digital sovereignty is part of a broader effort to reduce Europe’s dependence on American weapons, trade, technology and more. At a summit in Belgium this week, President Emmanuel Macron of France warned that the reliance makes the continent more vulnerable to economic and political coercion from the White House, and he urged other European leaders to seize “the Greenland moment” to do something about it. Economists and bankers have also been urging lawmakers to approve the creation of a digital euro — the online version of cash — to lessen dependence on American financial service companies and networks. Image President Emmanuel Macron of France at a summit in Belgium, where he warned about Europe’s technological dependence. Credit... Virginia Mayo/Associated Press “Trump was elected and everyone started getting very, very scared,” said Dan Davies, formerly an economist at the Bank of England. Europeans woke up to Mr. Trump’s willingness to use their needs to squeeze Europe and realized “now this is obviously a national security issue.” Nearly two-thirds of the transactions in countries that use the euro, the second-most commonly used currency in global trade, were handled by Mastercard or Visa in 2025, according to the European Central Bank. And at least 13 European nations, including Austria, Spain and Ireland, have no nationally controlled option for in-store or online digital payments. The issue gained urgency as leaders began to consider that powerful tools that Washington once reserved for adversaries like Russia and Iran could be turned on them. The risk is rising that Europe could “lose control over the most fundamental element in our economy: our money,” 70 prominent economists and other experts wrote in a letter to the European Parliament last month. Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, has pointed to Mr. Trump’s decision to impose sanctions on judges and prosecutors at the International Criminal Court for investigating whether Israel committed war crimes in Gaza. Mr. Trump’s action effectively cut off their access to digital and financial services, including credit cards. And because the executive order barred U.S. companies from providing services to those listed, the chief prosecutor’s email account provided by Microsoft was turned off. Image Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, has warned that U.S. sanctions threaten Europe’s financial sovereignty. Credit... Frederick Florin/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The move set off shudders among government and security officials throughout Europe as an illustration of Mr. Trump’s quickness to leverage America’s financial and tech dominance to punish opponents even in allied countries. “That gives you one very specific example of how we are not effectively sovereign in our own garden,” Ms. Lagarde said in an interview with The Financial Times. The Trump administration’s embrace of stablecoins and cryptocurrencies has only ratcheted up concerns in the European Union about control of the euro. Worries about the integrity of sensitive and private information, too, are rising. Legislation passed by Congress in recent years, including changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and a law known as the CLOUD Act, gives the U.S. government additional powers to spy on foreigners’ communications without a warrant and to force American companies to hand over data from anywhere around the globe. Mr. Trump has also threatened the 27-member European Union with tariffs if it tries to regulate or tax American tech firms. The risk of “exposing our scientific exchanges, sensitive data and strategic innovations to non-European actors” prompted the French government to order all state workers to stop using the American-owned video platform Zoom and switch to a homegrown alternative, Visio. Municipalities in Germany, Denmark and France have also been shifting from American-owned systems to European or other alternatives. Image People came out in Copenhagen, Denmark, in January to protest President Trump’s threats over Greenland. Credit... Hilary Swift for The New York Times But there can be glitches. The Netherlands had hired Solvinity, a Dutch cloud company, to operate its national digital identity system. But in November, the firm announced an agreement to be acquired by the American multinational Kyndryl. European leaders have vowed to spend billions to build cloud computing infrastructure and develop artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Reducing dependence on American tech or financial services firms is easier said than done. The banking industry in Europe, which is developing private payment alternatives, has opposed a digital euro, and so have far-right political parties, citing concerns about privacy and economic centralization. As for digital technologies, at least 80 percent of Europe’s are imported, according to a recent report by European Digital SME Alliance, a trade group. In 2013, Europe controlled about 22 percent of the global market for information and communications technology. By 2022, it was only about 11 percent. Many European leaders see artificial intelligence as an area where Europe can thrive. But the region has fallen far behind the United States and China in building the most cutting-edge systems. In countries like Britain, Germany, Spain and Norway, many of the biggest A.I. projects are being spearheaded in partnership with American tech firms, which have vowed to spend hundreds of billions on new data centers and other infrastructure. “The computational divide has become a chasm,” warned a report published by Oxford University and other research groups. Microsoft, Apple and Google, which have major customer bases in Europe, have tried to reassure governments in the region that they can be trusted. Yet many have been left questioning how the companies would respond to national security orders made by the U.S. government. “If they are asked by the U.S. administration to hand over data, which can be sensitive data, they may not be in a position to say no,” said Andrea Renda, an expert on digital policy at CEPS, a think tank in Brussels, and an adviser to European Union officials. Constance de Leusse, executive director of the A.I. and Society Institute in France, said all involved might be hurt as the ties between important allies eroded. “The race to dominate by the U.S. and for autonomy on the European side may hurt everyone,” she said. “It feels like a losing game for both sides.” A correction was made on Feb. 12, 2026 : An earlier version of this article misstated the status of Kyndryl’s acquisition of Solvinity. An agreement was announced in November, but the acquisition is not yet complete. When we learn of a mistake, w",

Feb. 12, 2026 A popular knock on Orange County, Calif., is that it is a mass of indistinguishable neighborhoods designed for the efficient placement of tract homes. But a few miles down the highway from Disneyland, smack in center of the county, lies a subtle refutation of sprawl-style growth. The city is Irvine, population 300,000 or so. On the surface it looks like a typical American suburb with curlicue streets and shopping centers abundant in parking. What makes Irvine unique is that unlike most of its neighbors, it also has a dense base of employment that includes a university, manufacturing and high-rise office buildings — in other words, it is a true city. This happened fast, and not organically. Almost all of Irvine was built by a single entity, the Irvine Company, which for most of its 160-year history was a grain and citrus farming operation. The company started developing this farmland during California’s post-World War II boom, and in the late 1970s was taken over by a group of investors that included Donald Bren. (Bren, 93, is now the sole owner and one of the country’s richest people, thanks to Irvine’s growth.) The company planned most of Irvine’s parks, streets and structures, and it continues to own a majority of the city’s apartments, shopping centers and offices — even a local newspaper . Almost no place in America is more completely a company town. Image A single company planned most of Irvine’s parks, streets and structures. Credit... Matt Gush/Shutterstock As the country grapples with a housing shortage, Irvine’s model has gained a new appeal. What more efficient way to produce homes and expand businesses than building new urban areas on vacant land without the complexities of an existing city? Enticed by the potential profits and eager to have more control over their footprint, investors and businesses are backing new town and city concepts that, like Irvine, are guided by a private hand. Some of the plans are dead serious, others fanciful. Perhaps not surprisingly, their most enthusiastic proponents tend to be technology billionaires. Take, for instance, Starbase, Texas , a newly incorporated city that has clusters of employee housing built around manufacturing and launch facilities owned by SpaceX, Elon Musk’s rocket company. Starbase, which encompasses about 1.5 square miles near the Mexican border , is one of several attempts to use Texas’ abundant land and loose development laws to seed start-up communities with names like Proto-Town and Austantinople . Back in California, a group of Silicon Valley moguls are pursuing something much grander: a proposal to build a city of 400,000 people on top of rolling hills an hour north of San Francisco (at the moment those hills are occupied by sheep farms and wind turbines). California Forever, the company behind the project, has spent about $1 billion acquiring 70,000 acres of farmland and put forth a plan to build a walkable community with nearby manufacturing and shipbuilding facilities. There is, of course, a big difference between declaring an intent to build a whole city and doing it. In 2021, Marc Lore, the billionaire founder of the shopping portal Jet.com, announced Telosa, which is imagined as a desert city of five million people. Lore’s aim is to upend the economics of land use: A foundation would manage development and lease land to residents and businesses (who would own the buildings). Telosa has a small team of employees and consultants, and a website with animations of elevated trams cruising past pedestrian-friendly streets. It has also yet to acquire land, so, for now, is more utopian dream than real-life destination. These efforts might seem kooky if the drive for new cities wasn’t also getting purchase from influential policy minds. The economists Paul M. Romer , a Nobel laureate and professor at Boston College, and Edward L. Glaeser of Harvard have boosted the new city concept in the United States and abroad. At the same time, urbanists are organizing pop-up villages and designing car-lite and even car-free neighborhoods. About a year after the California Forever project was revealed , Devon Zuegel, a software engineer, announced a proposal for a new neighborhood in the Sonoma County city of Cloverdale. The project is called Esmeralda . Esmeralda, which borrows heavily from the new urbanist movement, is slated for a site where the city had earlier approved a golf course neighborhood dotted with large, single-family homes and ample yards. Zuegel’s hope is to execute a kind of planning U-turn. Esmeralda’s ambition is to build 605 higher-density homes with front porches and bike-friendly streets all linked to shops, offices and hotel rooms by walkways and a community plaza. Even the biggest of these projects is tiny compared with new city ideas in the rest of the world. There is nothing to match the scale and hubris of, say, Neom , the $500 billion city that Saudi Arabia hopes will diversify its oil-dependent economy, or the dozens of new cities in Asia whose stock of empty buildings makes them seem both impressive and like a good way to go broke. During his 2024 campaign, President Trump announced his intent to create “ Freedom Cities ” that would be constructed on federal land and “reignite American imagination” by embracing innovations like flying vehicles that take off and land vertically. But as president, he has not offered much of a blueprint, and has instead mostly pushed ideas to allow prospective home buyers to take on more debt . However it happens, America needs more housing. Economists estimate the current shortage at somewhere between four million and seven million units, which would take several decades to build at the current pace of construction. The easiest way to boost those numbers is to build more housing on the urban edge, where land and construction are less expensive. The unifying thesis of projects like California Forever and Esmeralda is to use the logic of sprawl-style growth — build on undeveloped land outside city centers — to create neighborhoods that aim to minimize the use of cars. “When I look around America and I see what’s being built, I have a hard time finding places I want to live,” said Zuegel, the chief executive of Esmeralda. “I’m not thrilled about the idea of raising kids in a city like San Francisco, where it would be hard to have independence at a young age. At the same time, I don’t want to live in a car-centric suburb where you can’t walk to a store.” Open land represents the future in its purest form — after all, every place was no place at some point. The quest for resources, escaping bondage or seeking places to worship freely have all motivated new settlements and fresh modes of living. Buildings, sure, but also a chance to improve society in a place where the future looms larger than the past. “We are trying to create a place that will someday have all the messiness and complexity that real cities have,” said Gabriel Metcalf, the head of planning for California Forever. “The word ‘city’ is an expression of that ambition.” But every idea needs a model. And in the United States, it’s hard to find a more successful one than Irvine. A City Built From Scratch The weekday drive from Los Angeles to Orange County is choked with traffic and rimmed by strip malls. On a recent morning, I made the slog to meet Michael Stockstill, a former employee of the Irvine Company and co-author (with H. Pike Oliver) of “Transforming the Irvine Ranch,” the definitive history of Irvine and its post-World War II transformation. Over the next few hours, Stockstill drove me around while narrating the city’s history. Calling my attention to the absence of billboards",

The U.S. economy put in a strong showing at the start of 2026, following a year of disruptions that depressed both the demand for labor and its supply. Employers added 130,000 jobs in January, the Labor Department reported on Wednesday, in a report delayed from last week by a short government shutdown. The unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent from 4.4 percent a month earlier. The peppier-than-expected data is a sign that the labor market might be emerging from a period of extremely slow growth brought on by a trade war that made companies hesitant to hire, an immigration crackdown that lowered the number of available workers and a federal government firing spree. Annual revisions to earlier data changed the picture of last year. The economy added only 181,000 jobs in 2025, down from an earlier estimate of 584,000. Here’s what else to know: More people working: The labor force participation rate for people in their prime working years, between 25 and 54, jumped to 84.1 percent. That is as high as it’s been since 2001. Narrow growth: As has been the case for more than a year, health care accounted for more than half of job gains in January, adding 82,000 positions. Construction gained 33,000 jobs, but most other sectors were flat, and the federal government shed another 35,000 positions. Working longer: In another sign of strong labor demand, the average workweek edged up by 0.1 hours. That number has been depressed for months, as employers tried to keep people busy even with fewer orders. Wages up: Average hourly earnings rose by 3.7 percent over the year, a pace that has been fairly consistent in recent months. However, that growth has become more stratified, with those on the higher end of the income ladder seeing faster raises . Slow hiring, slower layoffs: Other federal data released last week showed that job openings dropped to 6.5 million in December, the lowest level since September 2020. At the same time, initial claims for unemployment insurance remained very low in January, suggesting that employers are not laying off more people than usual. A seasonal quirk: Sluggish hiring of seasonal workers during the holidays may have boosted the number. If fewer were laid off in January, that would translate into a stronger reading after the Bureau of Labor Statistics adjusts for typical seasonal fluctuations. The Fed has time: The February jobs report is slated to be released before the Federal Reserve meets next to set interest rates, in mid-March. That is, unless another government shutdown delays the report again.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The U.S. economy is growing, but not evenly. What began as an uneven rebound from the Covid-19 pandemic has hardened into what many economists describe as a “K-shaped” economy , in which higher-income households pull ahead while lower-income households fall further behind . High interest rates, rising costs and the rapid growth of artificial intelligence could deepen those divides, economists warn. “We are returning to a typical pattern of extremely high income inequality, and it now stands at a 60-year peak,” Beth Ann Bovino, chief economist at U.S. Bank, wrote in a recent report . “The worry is not just where we stand now, but also whether ongoing developments will worsen the situation.” The net worth of the top 1 percent of households climbed to a record share of nearly 32 percent of the national total in the third quarter of 2025, according to data from the Federal Reserve , which started tracking household wealth in 1989. Spending patterns have also split: Households earning under $75,000 a year are spending less on discretionary categories like travel and experiences than they did in 2019, while those making more than $150,000 are spending more, according to Bank of America Institute . Retail sales softened in December, data released on Tuesday showed, weighed down by a slight drop in purchases of vehicles and food. More executives are acknowledging the divide and its effects on their business. Delta Air Lines said in October that ticket sales for premium seats were expected to outpace those in the main cabin. The snack maker Mondelez said this month that consumers were “worried about overall affordability” and pulling back on snacking or shifting to value-store brands. “They are fed up with the price increases — they don’t feel good about their personal economic outlook,” Dirk Van de Put, chief executive of Mondelez, said during an earnings call. “And as a consequence, snacking is being affected.” Here is what some other companies have said about prices, spending and how the “K-shaped” economy is affecting their businesses: Chipotle: The fast-food chain is aiming to increase foot traffic and revenue amid weak comparable sales by focusing on higher-income consumers — a segment the company recently identified as its core audience, with 60 percent of customers from households earning above $100,000 on average. Clorox: The cleaning brand is adjusting pricing and product sizes to respond to pressure on all consumers but especially lower-income customers, Linda Rendle, the company’s chief executive, said on an earnings call this month. Clorox said shoppers were trading down to smaller packages at dollar stores or buying in bulk at club stores. Yum Brands: During its latest earnings call this month, Yum Brands, which owns Taco Bell and KFC, reported transaction growth across all income levels, with particularly notable gains among higher-income consumers in the last quarter. PayPal: The online payment company announced that it would no longer commit to the specific 2027 outlook presented at last year’s investor day. Instead, it plans to provide forecasts one year at a time, citing the influence of “macro factors and a K-shaped economy,” Jamie Miller, the company’s interim chief executive, said in a conference call this month. McDonald’s: The fast-food chain revived its “Extra Value Meal” combos as traffic from lower-income customers declined while visits from higher-income customers rose double digits. Chris Kempczinski, its chief executive, described the trend as a “two-tier economy.” Coca-Cola: The beverage company said in October that sales growth had been driven by higher-income consumers buying premium brands, while middle- and lower-income shoppers remain under pressure and more focused on value.

Andrea Chronopoulos Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 8:26 min Learn more Share full article 287 By Lydia DePillis Feb. 11, 2026 Economists at top banks and investment firms who command high salaries to divine the direction of the economy expected the latest jobs report on Wednesday to show that about 68,000 jobs were added last month. A crowd of anonymous online gamblers placing bets on Kalshi, a prediction site, expected to see 54,000 new jobs. The report ended up showing the U.S. economy had added 130,000 jobs at the start of the year. Both groups had missed the mark by a wide margin — and to similar degrees. Over the five years that Kalshi has existed , its thousands of gamblers have proved as accurate on average at predicting certain economic indicators as the highly trained forecasters, a working paper published last month by the National Bureau of Economic Research found. The crowd is also pretty good at predicting interest rate decisions from the Federal Reserve, and even better than the professionals at predicting the rate of inflation . “Getting information from a large pool of people can be a remarkably good form of forecasting,” said Jonathan Wright, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University who co-wrote the paper. Thomas Simons, a U.S. economist with Jefferies, the investment firm, took notice when Kevin Warsh was leading in the prediction markets to be President Trump’s nominee for chair of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Simons had dismissed the possibility because of Mr. Warsh’s past advocacy for higher interest rates , rather than the lower rates that Mr. Trump prefers. “‘How could it possibly be that he’s at the head of this? It doesn’t make any sense,’” Mr. Simons recalled thinking. But the markets turned out to be right , and he decided he shouldn’t disregard the odds. Bettors, he realized, have one advantage: They don’t have to make a prediction if they’re not highly confident that they’re right. Professional forecasters don’t have a choice; even if the data are confusing and they don’t have much conviction in the number, they guess. “You have to forecast these numbers every month even when you don’t necessarily think you have some kind of edge,” Mr. Simons said. “So it starts to make me feel like, if I go back to my priors on this, the people who have edge are the ones who are going to participate.” Another working paper , by economists at the London Business School and Yale University, found that Polymarket bettors as a whole forecast corporate earnings more accurately than the analysts who are paid to advise investors on whether to buy or sell. Theis Jensen, a Yale professor who worked on the paper, thinks the comparatively good performance by thousands of amateurs can be chalked up to incentives. Professional analysts may have conflicts of interest, such as their firm’s trading commissions, which might rise in response to rosier forecasts. Analysts may also avoid publishing earnings forecasts that are out of the norm, which can lead to more embarrassment than sticking with the crowd. “The nice thing about prediction markets is that you have to put your money where your mouth is,” Mr. Jensen said, “and so that highly incentivizes you to state your true beliefs.” Of course, that has been true for decades. The first online prediction markets emerged in the early 2000s. Sites like Intrade focused mostly on elections and the likelihood of other world events, and were generally found to be fairly accurate. In the 2010s, U.S. regulators cracked down, ruling that they were operating as illegal gambling platforms. But some platforms continued to operate in Europe, where political and economic contracts are a sideshow to enormous volumes of sports betting. The same is still true of Kalshi , which won a lawsuit allowing it to operate legally in 2024, and Polymarket , which is only sporadically accessible in the United States as lawsuits have blocked trading in many states. And yet betting volume even on nonsports questions has expanded at such a torrid pace that forecasters and analysts are taking notice. On any given day, more than $60 million is at stake on the platforms on political and economic questions — far more than the earlier platforms reached. Edward Ridgely runs Stand, a company that allows bettors to trade simultaneously on Kalshi and Polymarket and follow other large traders. He said many of his highest-volume customers worked in the same fields where they wagered. One user in Hong Kong buys and sells Nvidia stock in his day job and uses the tariff-related prediction market contracts as a hedge. “If the Trump tariffs escalate toward China or something, he can get out of his position and not get blown away,” Mr. Ridgely said. He sees another piece of evidence that bettors specialize: Most of them aren’t good at everything. “You can see that a lot of the traders who are really good at elections aren’t very good at crypto. Or if you’re really good at crypto, you’re not very good at geopolitics,” he said. Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist of J.P. Morgan, has access to a deep well of expertise from the bank’s political affairs staff, country specialists and equity researchers. But he still looks at the markets to get a more precise estimate. “Whenever you talk to D.C. people, they’ll say, ‘Well, I think they’ll get the budget done.’ So, what’s the probability?” Mr. Feroli said. “It’s a different language. Oftentimes you’ve got to really push to get a quantitative answer.” On the quantitative questions that are his stock in trade, like forecasting changes to the Consumer Price Index and gross domestic product, Mr. Feroli suspects something else is going on: The betting markets are just following the experts. That could mean monitoring the Bloomberg consensus, reading research from the big investment houses or tracking the futures markets and investor expectations that groups like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange already aggregate. Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University who studies forecasting, agrees that is likely. And therein lies a danger in prediction markets: If the crowd were to supplant professional forecasters, individual bettors would lose out. “They would be making the jobs of their contributors harder, because now they have individual sources of information to draw from,” Ms. Sinclair said. “If they replace all of that, then they won’t have those to also go to.” Most forecasters aren’t worried about that, because they do more than predict numbers. Every estimate comes with a detailed analysis of the factors underneath the headline number, which is what investors and companies need to figure out how to spend money. “Surprises happen, and people want to know, ‘What does this mean, what’s going to happen, what’s driving it?’” said Michael Pugliese, a U.S. economist with Wells Fargo. “I think that’s a lot of nuanced, important information that you’d want to have when you are making decisions, as an operator in these markets.” But prediction markets could become an input for some complex forecasts, like those constructed by the Federal Reserve. Justin Wolfers, an economics professor at the University of Michigan who studied and wrote about the earlier iterations of prediction markets, has told Fed officials that they should take those markets into consideration. They have been hesitant, he said. “There’s a deep problem, which is, if you were to do this, you democratize decision making,” Mr. Wolfers said. “Right now the senior economist has a ton of power. Their view goes.” It may also be true that neither individual experts nor a collective of thousands are the best at predicting the future. Over the past decade, a group called Good Judgment has developed a model of selecting people with good track records of figuring out what will happen. These “superforecasters” are applied to longer-range questions of interest to paying clients. They work collaboratively, but u",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Strong monthly jobs growth and easing unemployment have pushed back expectations about when the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates again, suggesting the central bank is poised for an extended pause. Data released on Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed monthly jobs growth of 130,000 positions, almost double what economists had forecast, and the unemployment rate ticking down to 4.3 percent. That is down from a recent peak of 4.5 percent in January and slightly lower than December’s level. The unemployment rate has become a focal point for the Fed as it assesses the health of the labor market in the wake of immigration restrictions imposed by President Trump. The crackdown, which has led to a sharp slowdown of migration into the country, has decreased the supply of new workers available for hire. The number of new jobs the economy needs to keep the unemployment rate stable has dropped as a result, with research suggesting it could turn negative by this year. In 2024, the so-called monthly break-even rate was estimated to be well above 100,000 positions. Financial markets shifted sharply on Wednesday after the jobs report was released, with traders pushing back the timing of the next cut to July from June. “The window to see a material weakening in the labor market is probably closing,” said Stephen Juneau, an economist at Bank of America. “It seems like we have more momentum building in the economy rather than the reverse of that.” The Fed is trying to safeguard the labor market while also ensuring that rates are high enough for inflation to fall back to the central bank’s target of 2 percent. Price pressures have mounted as Mr. Trump’s tariffs have taken effect, although the overall impact has been more muted than initially expected. Officials at the Fed broadly expect the peak impact from those levies to hit in the first quarter of this year before inflation begins to decelerate again. January’s Consumer Price Index report, set to be released on Friday, will give policymakers insight into whether that forecast is bearing out. Economists expect annual inflation to tick down to 2.5 percent after a 0.3 percent increase in monthly prices. “Core” inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy items, is expected to stay sticky at 2.5 percent, only slightly lower than the previous 2.6 percent annual pace. But in a sign that labor-related price pressures remain muted, the employment cost index, a quarterly measure from the Labor Department that tracks changes in wages and benefits, unexpectedly slowed in the final three months of 2025. Economists at Evercore ISI said that data, which came out on Tuesday, confirmed their view that the “economy is cooling under the hood, even though we face up to another six months of elevated tariff pass-through.” Beyond the impact of tariffs, the Fed is also contending with the prospects of stronger growth in the coming quarters as Americans receive larger refunds as a result of Mr. Trump’s new tax cuts. The ongoing boom in artificial intelligence investments is also expected to fuel economic growth. Bank of America’s Mr. Juneau described the tax refunds as a “jolt for consumption over the next few months.” He said that, coupled with a likely easing of trade uncertainty ahead of the midterms, could imbue companies with the confidence to hire and invest more in the economy. “This year, with the midterms, you’re not going to see tariffs really ratcheted up again,” he said. At the Fed’s meeting just last month , Jerome H. Powell, the chair, struck a more upbeat tone about the economic outlook. He described the labor market as “stabilizing” after a period of weakness last year and noted that consumer spending and business fixed investment remained strong, even as Americans had grown less confident about the economy. “The economy has once again surprised us with its strength, not for the first time,” Mr. Powell said. That shift helped to justify the central bank’s decision at that meeting to pause rate cuts after a series of reductions last year. Between September and December, the Fed lowered rates by an aggregate three-quarters of a percentage point to a range of 3.5 percent to 3.75 percent. By the December meeting, the Fed’s policy decisions had become increasingly fraught, reflecting a fissure between policymakers over how to weigh concerns about the labor market versus inflation. Those divisions have lessened, but even January’s vote to hold rates steady was not unanimous. Stephen I. Miran, who has dissented at every meeting since he joined the Fed in September, voted in favor of a quarter-point cut. He was joined by Christopher J. Waller, a governor who was a finalist to replace Mr. Powell as chair when his term is up in May. A few days after that meeting, Mr. Trump tapped Kevin M. Warsh , a former Fed governor, for the job. In explaining his dissent, Mr. Waller said that revisions to the jobs data would likely show no growth in employment last year. “Zero. Zip. Nada,” Mr. Waller said in a statement. “This does not remotely look like a healthy labor market.” Further cuts appear to hinge on the labor market breaking out of its current “low hire, low fire” state and layoffs beginning to pick up in a more broad-based way, or inflation significantly slowing. Mr. Powell last month stopped short of signaling any timeline for future moves, reiterating that the central bank is “well positioned” for the moment and to address any economic challenges. He did, however, downplay the possibility of a rate increase this year. “We don’t take things off the table, but it isn’t anybody’s base case right now,” Mr. Powell said. Traders still expect rates to fall toward 3 percent by year-end, but to get there more slowly than before. Many officials believe that 3 percent rates would shift policy to a “neutral\" setting that neither stimulates nor restricts growth. Mr. Trump, who said his support of Mr. Warsh was contingent on his pushing for lower borrowing costs, has argued for rates to be closer to 1 percent. In a social media post on Wednesday after January’s report was released, the president again called for the country to be paying the lowest interest rate in the world and said it would lead to cost savings of at least $1 trillion a year related to payments to service the national debt. But the Fed does not take into consideration interest payments on the debt when setting policy. It is congressionally mandated to pursue low, stable inflation and a healthy labor market. “If you’re somewhat in the neutral camp and inflation is above target, then it’s harder for them to make the case to cut,” Priya Misra, a portfolio manager at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said of the Fed. “They need a clear emergency message from the labor market.” Colby Smith covers the Federal Reserve and the U.S. economy for The Times.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Job growth over the past two years was far weaker than previously believed. U.S. employers added just 181,000 jobs last year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Wednesday. That was 69 percent fewer jobs than its initial estimate of 584,000. The agency also lowered its estimate of job growth in 2024 by nearly 28 percent. In total, the U.S. economy has more than a million fewer jobs than previously reported. The revisions are part of a longstanding annual process in which the B.L.S. reconciles its monthly estimates of job growth, which are derived from surveys, with less timely but more reliable data from state governments. In the past, the so-called benchmark revisions have typically been small and attracted relatively little attention. But the 2024 adjustment was the biggest in years, reducing estimated job growth by nearly 600,000. This year’s revision was even bigger, the largest since 2009 in percentage terms. The new data makes even more pronounced the “low hire, low fire” stasis that has characterized the labor market for much of the past two years. The revisions didn’t affect the unemployment rate, which ticked down to 4.3 percent in January. But they suggest that job growth ground nearly to a halt last year, making it hard for anyone without a job to find one. “We’ve been hearing from workers that the job market is not working for them for some time,” said Daniel Zhao, chief economist at the employment site Glassdoor. “The anecdotes are starting to align with the data.” The revisions also underscore how dependent the job market has become on hiring in the health care sector . Before the revisions, health care accounted for about 405,000 of the 584,000 jobs added in 2025, or nearly 70 percent of the gains. According to the latest data, health care companies added 391,000 jobs, while employment in other sectors fell by a combined 210,000 jobs. “That really puts into sharp relief how poorly other industries are doing even as health care continues to grow,” Mr. Zhao said. The consecutive large revisions have led some economists to question the reliability of the survey-based monthly estimates. In December, Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, said economists at the central bank estimated that the B.L.S. had been overstating employment gains by about 60,000 jobs per month — a figure that, if accurate, would suggest that employers were cutting payrolls for much of last year. The revisions have become a political issue. President Trump pointed to the previous big adjustment when he fired Erika McEntarfer, the head of the statistical agency, last summer, saying it showed she was incompetent and biased against him. Experts across the ideological spectrum rejected those accusations, noting that there was no consistent political pattern in the revisions. Rather, they said, the large revisions highlighted the challenge of accurately measuring the economy during a period of falling survey response rates and changing employment patterns. Those challenges have been exacerbated by budget cuts and staff turnover, problems that predated Mr. Trump but have grown worse since he returned to office. “I think we need to be more skeptical” about the monthly employment estimates, said Guy Berger, a labor economist who follows the numbers closely. He said he remained confident that the estimates were free from political bias. But the large revisions suggest the B.L.S. is struggling to get an accurate read on the state of the labor market. “You can trust that folks are trying to measure this accurately,” he said. But, he added, “I don’t think you can put a lot of weight on the specific monthly numbers.” But Jed Kolko, an economist who oversaw economic data at the Commerce Department during the Biden administration, said the statistical agencies had faced a particularly challenging period in recent years. “Revisions tend to be bigger when the economy is changing rapidly,” he wrote in an email. “Job growth has been unusually volatile for several years, first from the pandemic and then from the immigration surge, so revisions in recent years have been bigger.” One possible — though partial — explanation for the recent downward revisions relates to the way government statistics account for jobs created by newly started companies and destroyed by ones that go out of business. Such employers aren’t included in the monthly jobs survey, so the B.L.S. estimates their impact based on historical patterns, using a statistical method known as the “birth-death model.” That approach can’t always keep up with changes in the economy, however. During the coronavirus pandemic, Americans started new businesses in record numbers. More recently, job gains at new businesses have slowed. But it can take time for such shifts to show up in economic models. The B.L.S. said last year that it would change the birth-death model to be more responsive to shifts in the labor market. That should lead to smaller revisions in the future. But it could also make the initial monthly estimates more volatile and harder to interpret. The birth-death model accounted for only a fraction of the big revisions in 2024 and 2025, however. That suggests the updated method won’t fully resolve the recent issues with the monthly estimates. Doubts about the government’s data have led some economists in recent months to give renewed attention to alternative estimates from private sources such as ADP, the payroll processor. But those sources are less comprehensive than the official statistics, and often rely on government data to calibrate their models. Private data isn’t immune from revisions of its own. ADP last week updated its job estimates to align them with government data, a process similar to the B.L.S.’s annual benchmarking procedure. The revision reduced ADP’s estimate of private-sector job growth in 2025 by more than a third, and made substantial changes to the company’s figures as far back as 2020.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The U.S. economy put in a strong showing at the start of 2026, following a year of disruptions that depressed both the demand for labor and its supply. Employers added 130,000 jobs in January, the Labor Department reported on Wednesday, in a release delayed from last week by a short government shutdown. The unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent from 4.4 percent a month earlier. The peppier-than-expected reading is a sign that the labor market might be emerging from a period of extremely slow hiring brought on by a trade war that made companies hesitant to hire, an immigration crackdown that lowered the number of available workers and a federal government firing spree. Annual revisions to earlier data, which are routine but have been larger than usual in recent years, darkened the picture of 2025. The economy added only 181,000 jobs last year, down from an earlier estimate of 584,000. Not counting the pandemic year of 2020, that is the slowest pace since 2010, the midst of the Great Recession. “The revised numbers tell a more accurate story of what people were experiencing, which was really, really, really slow job growth and stagnation on a pretty major scale,” said Nicole Bachaud, a labor economist with the job search website ZipRecruiter. For perspective, the economy added nearly as many jobs last month alone than the entire gain during all of 2025. “This is giving a glimpse of what might be a turning point for the market as stabilization is taking place,” Ms. Bachaud said. “This is a pretty significant shift.” It’s too soon to tell if the January numbers represent a real acceleration. The numbers may have been flattered by a seasonal quirk: Retailers hired many fewer seasonal workers than usual over the holidays. If fewer were laid off in January, that would translate into a stronger reading after the Bureau of Labor Statistics adjusts for typical seasonal fluctuations. The end of last year saw the lowest number of job openings since late 2017, and since last July there have been more unemployed people than there are jobs available for them. Measures of consumer sentiment have been downbeat — the Conference Board’s index of whether workers see jobs as easy or hard to find was as pessimistic in December as it’s been since early 2021, when the economy was still emerging from the pandemic. But there is some evidence that the labor market may be grinding back into gear. Gross domestic product growth has been very strong, which could allow companies to make more investments that in turn increase their demand for labor. Surveys of manufacturers have been trending more optimistic, following two years of job losses and lackluster output. A broader measure of unemployment , which includes people working part time who would rather have more hours, dropped back to where it was last summer. Companies are also expecting a boost from lower taxes and deregulation this year, as well as potentially lower interest rates if the White House stops raising tariffs and inflation recedes further. “You’re hearing, ‘last year was pretty good all things considered, we survived the Trump tornado, and 2026 is looking all right, too,’” said Andrew Zatlin, managing director of SouthBay Research. “If I’m making all this money now, odds are the first quarter will also be super good.” President Trump celebrated the stronger-than-expected employment report on social media Wednesday morning and again called for lower interest rates. The Federal Reserve will see one more jobs report before it meets again in mid-March, but generally a falling unemployment rate is not seen as an argument for lowering borrowing costs, which tend to stimulate hiring. In fact, investors moved their expectations for the next rate cut to July from June after the jobs report was released. It is not clear that the U.S. economy will be able to sustain this pace of growth. Part of the reason for the slow hiring last year was that the Trump administration clamped down on immigration and ramped up deportations. That helped keep the unemployment rate from rising drastically even as job creation slowed, since fewer people were looking for work . January brought a good sign for labor supply. The share of people in their prime working years who are either employed or looking for a job reached 84.1 percent, the highest level since 2001. Still, the labor force is projected to flatline if immigration remains depressed. One thing hasn’t changed from last year : Job growth continues to be dominated by health care, which packed on 82,000 jobs in January. Construction added another 33,000, mostly among the specialty trade contractors that have been very busy building data centers. The federal government lost another 34,000 jobs and is down by 10.9 percent since reaching a peak in October 2024. “Health care has been carrying the load for the past couple of years in the private sector,” said Augustine Faucher, chief economist with PNC Financial Services Group. “I am concerned about the breadth of job growth, and the question is, how long can the economy continue to go with basically only health care adding jobs?” In recent months, several companies have made news by saying that investing in artificial intelligence allowed them to lay off thousands of workers. It is true that some of the fields that have been adopting A.I. fastest — such as information and professional and business services — have been shedding jobs. That is also partly because those fields hired much more quickly during the pandemic years, and have been going through a correction. However, A.I. may be finding its way into the labor market in more subtle ways. Eric Hagopian is the chief executive of Pilot Precision Products, a Massachusetts-based manufacturer and wholesaler of cutting tools that employs 35 people. He says that he’s been able to avoid hiring another customer service employee by adding an A.I.-powered agent to his website, and he hopes to augment more of his office staff in similar ways. “We have an accounts receivable manager, but she could do a lot more if she had someone doing all the matching of the invoice numbers to the bank statements, all those menial type things,” Mr. Hagopian said. People actually making things, however, are harder to automate. “You’re not going to replace people, ever, on the shop floor.” Mr. Hagopian thinks that leaning into A.I. will increase productivity, allowing him to pay his workers more. Wage growth has remained strong; average hourly earnings for private sector workers rose 3.7 percent since this time last year, a pace that’s been fairly consistent for the past year and a half. The workweek also lengthened slightly, which will put more money in workers’ pockets. Few analysts expect a strong rebound in manufacturing, which has shed 313,000 jobs over the past two years. But there are signs it could be finding its footing. “I think we’re seeing a manufacturing environment that’s going to start to stabilize,” said Stephanie Roth, chief economist with Wolfe Research. “You tend to need to have a proper recession to have a real early cycle environment, but this could be like the mid-1990s, where you get a bit of a reset.” Lydia DePillis reports on the American economy for The Times.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT President Trump campaigned on a platform of climate denial and a promise to reverse federal policies aimed at protecting the planet. But even experts have been stunned at the magnitude of the environmental protections he has unraveled and the speed with which his administration has acted. As Maxine Joselow and I report , the swift and meticulous dismantling of climate rules we are now seeing did not happen by chance. It was set in motion by a cadre of conservative lawyers who served in the first Trump administration and spent years honing arguments to block government regulations of climate pollution. We told the stories of four key players. Russell T. Vought and Jeffrey B. Clark, both high-profile allies of Trump, drafted executive orders. Mandy Gunasekara and Jonathan Brightbill, two conservative attorneys with long histories of fighting climate policies, collected what they called an “arsenal of information” to undermine the scientific and legal consensus that the planet is dangerously warming and the United States must take action. Both independently and in tandem, the four activists spent the Biden administration years charting roadmaps that a future Republican president could use to undermine established climate science and legally support the repeal of environmental rules. Those plans included Project 2025, a set of conservative policy recommendations for a second Trump term. A key climate rule Their biggest victory is around the corner. This week, the Environmental Protection Agency is expected to overturn what is known as the “endangerment finding,” a 2009 scientific determination that climate change threatens public health and welfare. By doing so, the federal government will effectively be relinquishing its authority to regulate the emissions that are dangerously warming the planet. Even more consequentially, reversing the endangerment finding could make it harder for a future administration to reverse course and curb emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other chemicals from automobile tailpipes and factory or power plant smokestacks. Vought, Clark, Gunasekara and Brightbill were not the only ones who pushed to repeal the endangerment finding. But documents obtained by Fieldnotes, a watchdog group, and reviewed by The New York Times, together with interviews with more than a dozen people show the four activists were the key strategists who sought to ensure that if Trump were re-elected, he could move rapidly and with minimal interference from civil servants. “We are pretty close to total victory,” Myron Ebell, a prominent critic of climate science, told us. Funding the fight Gunasekara and Brightbill sought $2 million to draft regulatory documents that a future administration could use to abandon the endangerment finding. The duo also planned to solicit white papers from scientists who did not accept the physics of climate change, according to a funding pitch for the project. The Heritage Foundation eventually agreed to fund some of this work, according to two people familiar with the matter. Clark has been fighting climate protections since 2005, when as a Justice Department lawyer in the George W. Bush administration he argued that the E.P.A. lacked the power to regulate greenhouse gases. He served as an assistant attorney general focusing on environmental deregulation during Trump’s first term. During the Biden administration Clark found a professional home with Vought, also a former Trump official. Vought had launched a think tanks, the Center for Renewing America, to keep the MAGA movement alive, and Clark drafted executive orders that a future president could use to swiftly scrap climate policies enacted by President Joseph R. Biden, according to two people familiar with the matter. Business groups initially fought the endangerment finding. But after years of lost legal challenges and public pressure to address climate change, most gave up. By 2017, when Trump first took office, hundreds of American companies, including oil giants and major manufacturers, had accepted the reality of climate change. Neil Chatterjee, a Republican who led the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the first Trump administration, told me it was the “pure ideological activists who believe that climate change is a hoax” who kept up the fight. And when Trump won the presidential race in 2024, they knew they’d have a willing partner in the White House. “They had the experience of being in Trump 1.0, seeing what they wanted to do, then got organized during the Biden years,” Chatterjee said, adding that they “used their time in the wild to plan, and also identify people who can execute the plan.” Now, Chatterjee said, “This is their moment.” Related : The E.P.A.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT As the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota takes a toll on local businesses, whose customers and employees are staying off the streets out of fear, some public budgets heads have a message to the White House: Stop. Democratic state treasurers, auditors and comptrollers from 15 states — including two from California — sent a letter on Wednesday to President Trump calling for a halt to aggressive tactics that they say have depressed economic activity and tax collections. “Many of our states already send more tax dollars to Washington than we receive in federal support,” read the letter, whose signatories also included the fiscal officers of Maryland, Oregon and New York. “We are now expected to absorb the fiscal consequences of enforcement activities. This is not acceptable.” State fiscal officers do not often weigh in as a group on law enforcement matters. They leave that to attorneys general, who frequently write collective letters and court briefs, typically with members of their own party. The letter was organized by For the Long Term , a group of progressive-leaning state and local financial overseers who aim to foster economic and budgetary stability beyond the rapid churn of election cycles. The signatories said they came together when they determined that what was unfolding in Minnesota crossed into their domain as stewards of the public purse. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment on the letter. Tom Homan, Mr. Trump’s border czar, said on Wednesday that the administration would withdraw 700 immigration agents from Minnesota, leaving around 2,000 there. Other states have also experienced extended Immigration and Customs Enforcement presence, including Illinois, where Operation Midway Blitz took place in the fall . Mike Frerichs, the state’s treasurer, said sales and income taxes dipped during that period, as people fearing federal officers avoided restaurants and shops in neighborhoods like Chicago’s Little Village. “If you’re terrorizing people, and they think they’re going to be arrested or shot, they’re going to stay home, and they’re not going to be spending money,” Mr. Frerichs said. “Donald Trump and Stephen Miller may not care about immigrants to this country, but the fear and chaos that they are sowing in our cities are having ripple effects on taxpaying Americans.” Officials from other states are thinking about what might happen if ICE came through in force. “There’s always concern that our state might be next,” said Mike Pellicciotti, the treasurer of Washington, which has large immigrant communities in both agriculture and technology. He said ICE deployments were just one of several blows from the federal government over the past year, including tariffs . “This reckless economic policy is having an impact across the board,” Mr. Pellicciotti said. “We’re a trade-dependent state. We’re a state that relies on a talented work force from around the world wanting to come.” Mr. Trump has threatened to withhold funding for Democratic cities and states, including child care subsidies, public housing assistance and food stamps. The White House has also pulled back clean energy and other infrastructure grants, such as $205 million for the $16 billion Gateway project between New York and New Jersey. For state and local finances, the damage from the Trump administration’s immigration restrictions and expanding enforcement efforts may take a while to play out, said William Glasgall, public finance adviser at the Volcker Alliance, a think tank. Many states, especially in the Northeast and the industrial Midwest, have depended on immigration to keep their populations steady or growing. “Budgets are getting tighter, and if the immigration restrictions begin to crimp the tax base — we’ll see in the next year or two what this looks like in terms of sales tax growth and income tax growth — then you have reason for concern,” Mr. Glasgall said. The list of signatories included states that received an influx of migrants during the Biden administration, a situation that also had tremendous fiscal costs. They were borne primarily by cities like Denver, whose mayor unsuccessfully pleaded for federal help as he spent tens of millions of dollars to accommodate the new arrivals. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that while the surge boosted tax revenues for state and local governments, their spending went up by about $10 billion more. State fiscal officers said current efforts to expel unauthorized immigrants had much wider implications for local economic activity because even legal residents feared being stopped and detained. “All of a sudden it presents this huge barrier to people participating in their communities,” said Dave Young, Colorado’s treasurer. Plus, he said, immigrants are essential to the state’s work force. “The concern that I have is that so many of these people that are here performing these tremendous services that we absolutely need, if they leave Colorado put us in a pretty significant economic bind,” he said.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT President Trump repeatedly promised during his campaign that he would end the war in Ukraine in one day. But by most measures, the war has grown worse for Ukrainians since Mr. Trump returned to the White House, not better. More civilians were killed and injured in 2025 than in the previous year. More missiles and drones are hitting city centers. Russia captured more territory in its slow-moving advances in 2025 than in any year since 2022, when it launched its full-scale invasion. Moscow has practically destroyed Ukraine’s power grid during the country’s harshest winter in more than a decade. “It was a hard year — how else can you imagine it?” said Oleksandr Polishchuk, whose wife was one of 13 people killed when a missile slammed into their apartment building in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in April. “Shelling, having to go to work, dealing with household issues, no electricity, no heating. I think it was very hard, extremely hard.” After taking office in January 2025, Mr. Trump tossed out the American playbook for the war. He made overtures to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, the aggressor in the conflict and an avowed opponent of the West, while distancing the United States from Ukraine. U.S. aid to Ukraine fell by 99 percent in 2025 compared with the year before, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German research center. Mr. Trump stopped giving American weapons to Kyiv, unless it or its Western allies paid for them.

Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times At the same time, Russia increased its own production of missiles, drones, shells and mines. Moscow used the weapons at a rapid clip, in part to improve its position in talks pushed by Mr. Trump, who has made no secret of his desire to be credited with ending the war. Delegations from Russia, Ukraine and the United States are scheduled to hold the next round of negotiations on Tuesday and Wednesday in Geneva. As he has moved away from a Biden administration policy of isolating Mr. Putin, Mr. Trump has succeeded in getting Russia and Ukraine to talk about settlement terms, including in face-to-face meetings in recent weeks. Mr. Trump has largely set aside traditional diplomatic principles that he said had done nothing to end the war, turning instead to negotiators he sees as seasoned deal makers. He has also imposed sanctions that have reduced the oil revenue that fuels Moscow’s war machine. But Mr. Putin has slow-walked his way through the months of negotiations, using them to buy time to continue his assault. A year into Mr. Trump’s second term and almost four years after Russia’s invasion, Mr. Putin has signaled no retreat from his goals of taking more Ukrainian territory and imposing Russian dominance. The White House did not respond to a request for comment for this article. Mr. Trump has acknowledged that the war is much harder to resolve than he thought it would be. Ukrainian officials have argued that the American president would have to take stronger action for Mr. Putin to change his thinking. Strength is a quality that Mr. Trump prizes above most others. He has asserted that Mr. Putin “respects” him in a way he did not respect previous U.S. administrations, which he says gives him leverage. Mr. Trump has said numerous times that the war never would have happened had he been president when the full invasion began in 2022. But Mr. Trump has shown a deference to Mr. Putin that has assuredly not been lost on the Kremlin leader. Mr. Trump has called his relationship with Mr. Putin “fantastic” and has repeatedly said that Mr. Putin “wants peace.” Mr. Trump has at times accepted Mr. Putin’s rewriting of history, including by blaming President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine for starting the war. Image Residential buildings amid electrical failures in Kyiv last month. Moscow has practically destroyed Ukraine’s power grid during the country’s harshest winter in more than a decade. Credit... Lynsey Addario for The New York Times Outside of occasional public criticism and the oil sanctions, Mr. Putin has largely dodged Mr. Trump’s threats. In July, Mr. Trump said he would give Russia “about 10 or 12 days ” to end the war before imposing new sanctions. Mr. Trump then announced a summit with Mr. Putin in Alaska, and the deadline passed. A month later, Mr. Trump again threatened “massive sanctions.” But he also showed reporters a photograph sent to him by Mr. Putin of the two men in Alaska and called it a sign of honor and respect . All the while, Moscow’s attacks inflicted a growing toll on Ukrainians. In 2025, Russia killed more than 2,500 Ukrainian civilians, more than in any year since 2022 and a 20 percent increase from 2024, according to United Nations statistics . Russia sent more than 53,000 long-range drones to civilian targets in Ukraine in 2025, almost five times as many as in 2024, according to a data set created by The New York Times using numbers from the Ukrainian Air Force. Moscow is also increasingly firing on city centers with ballistic missiles, which move so quickly that air-defense systems have difficulty knocking them down. Russia has launched 154 of those missiles at Ukraine this year, according to the data set, about three times the number fired during the same period last year. Got a confidential news tip?

To lead the American delegation, Mr. Trump has chosen real-estate developers with a personal connection to him.

Mauricio Lima for The New York Times “There are no limits for Putin, because a human dimension is not a priority of these negotiations,” Ms. Matviichuk said. “The politicians discuss natural minerals, Russia’s territorial interests, even Putin’s vision of Ukrainian history, but they don’t speak about people at all.” This month, Ms. Matviichuk, who runs an organization that shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022 for documenting war crimes by Moscow, posed a question on Facebook : “Why has Trump’s year of negotiations been the deadliest for civilians in Ukraine since the full-scale invasion?” The post received thousands of reactions. One woman alluded to Mr. Trump’s publicly stated desire for his own Nobel, asking if he would be more loyal to Ukraine if she gave her prize to him. Many Ukrainians, however, see Mr. Trump as loyal only to himself, and they have feared that in his rush to end the war, he will force an unjust peace on Ukraine. Ukraine’s European allies have said that Russia cannot be rewarded for its aggression. But a 28-point peace plan drafted late last year by American and Russian envoys looked to Ukraine like a demand for surrender. Ukrainian negotiators raced to soften its provisions, and the diplomatic dance has continued for months. Image After an August strike in Kyiv.

Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 8:24 min Learn more Share full article By Erika Solomon Leily Nikounazar and Sanjana Varghese Produced by Jon Hazell Feb. 17, 2026 With patriotic anthems and chants against the country’s clerical rulers, Iranians on Tuesday began commemorating the end of a traditional 40-day mourning period for loved ones killed at the peak of the government’s bloody crackdown on nationwide protests. The authorities have moved quickly to tamp down protests or other demonstrations of anti-government sentiment to mark the occasion, with videos verified by The New York Times showing security patrols in at least two cities. Tuesday is the first of what are expected to be several days of memorial ceremonies across the country to honor the 40th day since thousands of protesters were killed from Jan. 8 to Jan. 10. The commemorations will test both of the success of the crackdown and the ability of government opponents to find new ways to defy the state. Such ceremonies have played a pivotal role in the country’s modern history: They were a staging ground for the protests that eventually overthrew Iran’s shah in 1979. This week may not be such a dramatic turning point, but dissidents are already using the occasion as a way to voice their anger at the government. Some are transforming what was once a somber, religious funeral rite into boisterous, celebratory affairs, in a stark rejection of the country’s austere rulers. Video “They’ve reinvented this with a revolutionary rage,” said Arash Azizi, a historian of Iran based in New York. “It is an attempt by Iranians to take back their country and rediscover their nationalism.” For weeks before the memorials began, security forces sought to intimidate some families into not holding public memorials, according to rights groups and relatives of several slain protesters interviewed by The New York Times. On Tuesday, videos verified by The Times showed security forces patrolling some towns, including Lesfijan in the north, where trucks filmed on the streets were loaded with troops wearing helmets and camouflage gear. Commemorations for the dead after 40 days have been at the heart of Iran’s mourning culture for generations — one of the final rituals of farewell before returning to the rhythms of daily life. The ceremonies are common among the region’s Shiite Muslims. They have pre-Islamic roots in Iran too, and are practiced by Iranians of all faiths. As a profound cultural symbol in Iran, the authorities this week appeared keen to control the memorials. The government itself announced plans for official mourning ceremonies in the capital, Tehran, and the northern city of Mashhad. “We are grieving for the blood that was shed,” the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in a speech on Tuesday. He called security forces killed in the unrest “the highest-ranking martyrs.” Bystanders and protesters who were “misled,” he said, were also martyrs. Others killed “were the very corrupters, the seditionists, and coup plotters themselves,” he said. “Their reckoning is with God. We have nothing to do with them.” Image A protest in Tehran in early January. Credit... Getty Images The government argues that it was fighting unrest during the protests that was fomented by “terrorists” backed by Israel and the United States, leading to more than 3,000 deaths. Rights groups say that vastly underestimates the toll, particularly from Jan. 8 to 10, which many now consider the bloodiest days in Iran’s modern history. Over a total of three weeks of protests, the U.S.-based rights group HRANA says more than 7,000 protesters were killed, with most killed in that three-day period. One of the victims was Robina Aminian, a 23-year-old fashion student, whose family said she was shot in the head while protesting in Tehran. Officials banned her family from public 40th-day memorials, according to her aunt, Hali Nouri, who lives in Europe. For more than a month, Ms. Nouri said, plainclothes police were stationed at either end of the alleyway where the Aminian family resides. Reaching Ms. Aminian’s grave will be particularly arduous for her family. Security forces have regularly forced families to bury dissidents in remote areas to prevent their graves from becoming a gathering point, and Ms. Aminian’s family was forced to lay her to rest in a remote, snowy village of western Iran. “My sister says, ‘Even if they shoot bullets, I will go for her 40th day,’” Ms. Nouri told The Times. Image Robina Aminian, right, with her aunt, Hali Nouri, who lives in Norway. Credit... via the Aminian family There are increasing signs of dissent across Iran in the face of the continuing crackdown. At several universities, students have repeatedly attempted to hold sit-ins, according to student social media channels. And in some cities, videos showed Iranians took to their rooftops in the cover of darkness to chant for the toppling of the supreme leader. On Monday night, a small protest broke out in the southwestern town of Abdanan. In one video verified by The Times, people can be seen chanting “death to Khamenei” as passing cars honk. Video Another video , which appeared to be from Tuesday morning, shows security forces deploying in the town with armored vehicles. Another video showed large crowds screaming as they fled smoke and detonations near a cemetery in Abdanan. New displays of defiance do not necessarily mean that momentum toward a new wave of nationwide protests is building, said Farzan Sabet, an analyst on Iran and Middle East politics at the Geneva Graduate Institute in Switzerland. “What I think everyone is waiting for is whether the other shoe will drop — that is, whether a U.S. strike will happen or not.” The severity of Iran’s crackdown is also partly a reaction to threats beyond its borders. President Trump has massed warships in Persian Gulf waters, a show of force amid tenuous U.S.-Iran talks over reining in Iran’s nuclear and military capabilities. A brief round of talks was held in Geneva on Tuesday. But the risk of another regional war looms. “Almost everyone is waiting for Trump’s promises to be carried out and for foreign help to arrive,” said Masoud, an accountant in Mashhad who did not want to be identified by his full name for fear of repercussions. “The people have done everything they could.” Some Iranians said they are trying to hold 40th-day commemorations despite the restrictions. The family of the slain 17-year-old protester Mohammad Mahdi Ganj Danesh, signed pledges not to chant political slogans at their memorial, according to a family friend. Still, the authorities refused to grant them permission to hold their memorial at their mosque in the northern town of Zanjan. They, like several other families interviewed, rented an event hall instead. Video of the memorial obtained by The Times shows large crowds crammed together to celebrate his life and protest against the government. “The fallen flower has become a gift to the homeland,” they chanted and clapped. Video Instead of tearful rituals of mourning, many families of those killed at protests have transformed their commemorations with dancing, singing and clapping over people’s graves. This is seen as a way of defying traditionally somber religious customs that many Iranians now associate with the Islamic Republic’s austere rule. Video of the 40th-day ceremony for Raha Bahlooli-Pour, a student at the University of Tehran, shows mourners playing folk tunes instead of the customary recitations of Quranic verse. In the video, verified by The Times, women perform the traditional kel, a high-pitched ululation most Iranians traditionally reserve for weddings. Reimagining mourning rituals has been a part of Iran’s culture at least since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, said Mr. Azizi, the historian. At the time, Islamic revolutionaries transformed 40th-day ceremonies from somber affairs to “rabble-rousing occasions.” After an anti-gover",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of Spain said on Tuesday that his government will ask prosecutors to investigate social media giants X, Meta and TikTok for allegedly spreading child sexual abuse material generated by artificial intelligence, the latest salvo in a Europe-wide effort to regulate big tech companies. “These platforms are undermining the mental health, dignity, and rights of our children,” Mr. Sánchez wrote on social media . “The state cannot allow this. The impunity of these giants must end.” X and TikTok did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Meta declined to comment. After the French police raided the Paris offices of X in connection with similar accusations, the company said it “categorically denies any wrongdoing.” The Spanish announcement intensifies a growing dispute between European governments and American tech companies , which have been backed by the Trump administration over efforts on the continent to limit the industry. The clash has revealed starkly different visions between the United States and its tech giants and the European Union and its member states over what counts as protected speech, and the role of corporations in guaranteeing the welfare of those affected by their platforms. Europe has become a central experiment for the ability of democratic governments to regulate and effectively penalize one of the world’s most dominant industries. In December, the European Union issued the first fine under its new Digital Services Act, penalizing X, the social media platform owned by Elon Musk, for 120 million euros, about $140 million , for violations. This month, French police searched the local offices of X as part of the French cybercrime division’s own investigation into the spread of child pornography and Holocaust denial on the site. Britain’s data protection regulator has also announced an investigation into X over sexually explicit images generated by its A.I. chatbot, Grok. Ireland’s Data Protection Commission also said on Tuesday that it had opened an investigation into whether Grok had allowed pornographic images of children to spread on the platform. European leaders say their efforts are aimed at protecting citizens from abuse, rather than an attempt — as American politicians and tech leaders have argued — to limit free speech. Mr. Sánchez, a left-wing leader who has not been shy about challenging Mr. Trump or the American tech giants, asked prosecutors to “investigate the crimes that X, Meta, and TikTok may be committing through the creation and dissemination of child pornography using their AI.” This month, Spain joined France , Denmark and Australia in seeking to ban social media for children under the age of 16 , with Mr. Sánchez saying, “We will protect them from the digital Wild West.” His government’s proposed ban still requires parliamentary approval. But the proposed measure, and Mr. Sánchez referring to “crimes committed” by Grok, immediately triggered a vulgar and personally targeted attack against Mr. Sánchez by Mr. Musk. Some Spanish political analysts suggested that it was just the reaction hoped for by Mr. Sánchez, who has sought to position himself as a liberal leader on a global stage as he faces deep political divisions and scandals at home.

Feb. 17, 2026 Leer en español The square started filling well before dawn. Some revelers arrived clad in neon fishnets and doused in glitter. Others, who had been at parties elsewhere, napped on a grassy patch. The musicians came last, lugging drums and trumpets. It was Sunday morning during carnival in Rio de Janeiro, and the square in the city’s historic center was the setting for the start of a kind of roving marathon block party known as the Boi Tolo. The Boi Tolo has no set time, script or route, a swell of thousands of euphoric revelers marching through the city at a frantic pace. Those who miss the start spend the day trying to catch up, firing off messages in group chats: “Where is Boi Tolo?” Keeping pace is grueling. “Along the way, you start wondering, ‘Should I give up? I’m going to give up,’” said Lucas Fagundes, 35. “It’s like the ultimate test of your stamina.” The Boi Tolo has no set time, script or route. Few parties represent the fervor and chaos of Rio’s street carnival scene better than the Boi Tolo. Far from the glamour of official carnival parades, it has come to embody the gritty informal celebrations that take over the streets. By 6:50 a.m. on Sunday, the crowd at the square had grown to a few hundred people clad in bejeweled cowboy hats and shimmering bikinis. The musicians erupted in an improvised symphony of brass, drums and percussion instruments. A giant human chain formed around the band and everyone set off through the narrow streets, paralyzing traffic. As they passed a tram stop, a shiny Medusa blew soap bubbles toward commuters. Stilt walkers passed a bus stuck in the sea of people. One of the few rules of Boi Tolo is to keep moving. Whenever anyone stopped for an impassioned kiss, the crowd erupted: “Kiss and walk! Kiss and walk!” The direction is not always clear. “We decide the route in the moment,” said Luís Otávio Almeida, 62, one of the party’s founders. The Boi Tolo started by chance two decades ago, when a group of people arrived at a public square during carnival Sunday ready to party, but found no party, apparently misled by a newspaper announcement. One of the few rules of Boi Tolo is to keep moving. Frustrated, they decided to improvise. A beer vendor nearby had a tambourine. Someone called a friend with a drum. A lone trumpeter showed up, joining the group. Then, a reveler picked up a piece of cardboard and in lipstick scribbled “Boi Tolo,” or “foolish bull” (for their falling for the faulty announcement). The tradition stuck and it now draws tens of thousands of people each year. “Boi Tolo only exists because people want it to exist,” Mr. Almeida said. “Carnival is made on the streets. It’s made by the people.” This year’s party eventually spilled into a sprawling park, where costumed spectators hung off tree branches and squeezed under an overpass, as hundreds of people cheered above. To many “Cariocas,” as people from Rio are known, carnival is often akin to an extreme sport that requires grit and endurance. In recent years, growing numbers of visitors and searing temperatures have made it harder for even the most resilient to party hard. To try to beat the heat, Boi Tolo set out earlier than usual this year. Still, as temperatures topped 90 degrees, people fanned themselves and doused each other with water. By 11 a.m., the sun was scorching; a stilt walker in a sequin bikini crumpled to the ground. “I’m fine, my blood pressure just dropped,” she said, as she got up and started twerking again. Boi Tolo participants proceeding through a tunnel near the beach. The procession headed toward a pair of tunnels leading to Rio’s beachfront. Most participants were drenched in sweat, their makeup melting. But this is what they had been waiting for; the highlight of Boi Tolo. The beat quickened, echoing through the tunnel. The crowd burst into euphoric jubilation. “It’s magical,” said Perola Mendonça, 26. “It’s this incredible feeling of ecstasy.” On the other end, the party kept moving along the beachfront. By 4:30 p.m., the participants reached the end of the boardwalk, but they weren’t ready to stop. So they turned around and headed back toward the tunnel. After a 12-hour march through the city, a few hundred partygoers were still not ready to quit. With the light fading, they made their way back toward the city center where it all started. As they passed a stretch of beach they rushed onto the sand. A man in a cowboy hat hooked his snare drum on the crossbar of a goal post. The crowd closed in, as the musicians started playing a party anthem with lyrics the crowd could relate to. “I’m not going home! I’m not going home!” the revelers belted out, jumping up and down in the sand. Exhausted, Yasmin Santiago, 22, leaned on the goal post. She had joined a few hours earlier, not knowing what it was but eager to party. “This is Boi Tolo? No way!” Ms. Santiago said when she found out, her face lighting up. Turning to her friend, she called out: “Girl, did you hear that? We found Boi Tolo!We were looking for it for ages.” Image Some Boi Tolo revelers had waited all night for the festivities to begin. A correction was made on Feb. 17, 2026 : An earlier version of a picture caption misstated which revelers were shown.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The fans next to the Olympic sliding track oohed and aahed with each sharp turn. They admired the navigational precision and soft landing. They shouted, “You’re No. 1!” They were cheering for a drone pilot. “I’m almost feeling like I am with the athletes on the tracks,” said Ralph Hogenbirk, the pilot operating one of the many drones that have become the buzzing — and, for some, unsettling — soundtrack of the 2026 Winter Olympics. The robotic wasps chase behind lugers, skeleton pilots and bobsledders bombing down the ice track in Cortina d’Ampezzo. They are in hot pursuit of alpine skiers in the mountains of Bormio and record-shattering speedskaters gliding around the rinks in Milan, transporting viewers at home to the slopes and ice. All of their unerring following has earned them a following of their own. One night last week in Cortina, a small crowd gathered outside a white tent, cordoned off between a red tractor and heaps of dirty snow, a few yards below the start gate for the skeleton race. Inside, Mr. Hogenbirk sat in a corner, a visor over his eyes, piloting his nearly nine-ounce drone. It hovered behind the skeleton athletes as they collected themselves, crept behind them as they began their mad dash to start the race and then picked up speed, whirring behind the competitors as they shot down the track’s first curves.

It veered left and looped back over construction sites, parking lots, roped-off icy areas and into the cradled hands, red with cold, of Mr. Hogenbirk’s technician. “Very cool,” said Mary-Anne Grotheer, 33, the wife of a skeleton competitor who left the races to watch the drones come and go. Italians shouted, “Bravissimo!” and inquired about the drone’s specs. Germans appreciated its engineering. A group of British fans didn’t know what to think. “What the hell?” said Oliver Dickie, 26, a lawyer from London, as the returning drone, its green light blinking in the night, buzzed by on the way back to the tent. He said he imagined it improved the experience for spectators watching at home but wondered “how scary this would be” to be tracked by one. Athletes said not very. “I actually didn’t know they were there,” said skier Lara Markthaler, 19, of South Africa, who competed in the women’s giant slalom on Sunday. She said she had a tougher time with “the start camera like 10 centimeters from our face. That is what we do notice.” Others couldn’t wait to ski with Skynet .

James Hill for The New York Times “I saw the other competitors have drones and I was like, ‘Wow, that’s so cool, and I want to have that for my run,’” said Elin Van Pelt of Iceland, 20. She added with a laugh that having a drone follow her run for a television audience would mean, “I made it.” Drones have been used at the Olympics since the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, but have become increasingly common as the technology improves and sports audiences grow more used to up-close action. In these Games, drones are being called on to do more than ever before. Mr. Hogenbirk, a founder of the company Dutch Drone Gods, which has a background in professional drone racing, said that pilots of the drones had made sure the athletes were comfortable with them before the Games began. “Maybe they hear it a little bit, but it’s not distracting because they’re so fully focused on where they’re going,” said Mr. Hogenbirk. He said that his team had filmed each athlete before the Games, and that “everyone had a chance to say, ‘No, I don’t want this.’ None of them did.” Mr. Hogenbirk was speaking outside the tent, where he came to greet his adoring fans after his shift had ended. “People are just like filming and zooming in with their phones,” he said, adding that when the drones land people sometimes cheer, “Olympic medal!” Among the drone spectators was Kate Bentley, 26, a data analyst from Bristol, England. She was on a ski trip with friends and decided to check out the Olympics, she said, but found the skeleton athletes whooshing by her at about 90 miles per hour less than riveting. “I think skeleton could be a bit boring,” she said, “without the drones.” Jason Horowitz is the Madrid bureau chief for The Times, covering Spain, Portugal and the way people live throughout Europe.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Indirect talks between American and Iranian officials in Switzerland ended on Tuesday with an agreement on a “set of guiding principles,” according to Iran’s foreign minister, who said both sides had agreed to exchange drafts on a potential deal. The foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, was as positive as he was vague, providing little clarity on what had been discussed or when the next round of discussions might be held. American officials did not immediately comment publicly on the talks, but one U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations, said the two sides had made progress. The official said the Iranians would provide more detailed proposals in the next two weeks to address some of the gaps between the United States and Iran, but did not provide any specifics. Mr. Araghchi told Iranian state television that the talks, which were held in Geneva and lasted about three hours, had been “more constructive” and had made “good progress” compared with a previous round of negotiations in Oman this month. “We now have a clear path ahead, which in my view is positive,” he said. But Mr. Araghchi said a deal was not imminent, as the Middle East remained on edge over the possibility of an American attack should negotiations collapse. Iran has insisted that the talks be strictly limited to its nuclear program, even as U.S. officials have said they would push to curb the range of Iran’s ballistic missiles and its support of militias across the region. Mr. Araghchi did not address those points in his comments to Iranian state television, saying only that the two sides had reached a “general understanding on a set of guiding principles” to continue discussions and to “move toward drafting the text of a possible agreement.” “This does not mean that we can reach an agreement quickly, but at least the path has begun,” he said. Three Iranian officials familiar with the talks said that Iran had indicated a willingness to suspend nuclear enrichment for three to five years — which would cover the duration of Mr. Trump’s presidency — and then join a regional consortium for civilian grade enrichment. Iran would also dilute its stockpile of uranium on its own soil in the presence of international inspectors. In exchange, Iran has demanded that the United States lift financial and banking sanctions and the embargo on its oil sales. The officials, who asked not to be identified to discuss sensitive negotiations, said Iran was also dangling financial incentives and opportunities for investments and trade with the United States, including in Iran’s oil and energy sectors. The negotiations were hosted at the Omani ambassador’s residence by Oman’s foreign minister, Badr Albusaidi, who mediated the previous round of talks. A spokesman for Iran’s foreign ministry said ahead of the talks that Omani officials would shuttle between the two sides. Mr. Albusaidi said on social media after the talks that they had concluded “with good progress towards identifying common goals and relevant technical issues.” “Together we made serious efforts to define a number of guiding principles for a final deal,” he added. “Much work is yet to be done.” Steve Witkoff, the Middle East envoy, and Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law, had been expected to attend the negotiations, according to two U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy. Mr. Trump, speaking on Monday on Air Force One, said he would be involved in the talks “indirectly” and that they would be “very important.” He said Iran wanted to make a deal. The American president has ordered a buildup of U.S. forces in the region — including two aircraft carriers — after vowing last month to aid antigovernment demonstrators in Iran. The Iranian government quelled those protests in a bloody crackdown that killed thousands, according to rights groups. Now, Mr. Trump is calling on Iran to reach a deal to limit its nuclear and military capabilities or face a possible attack. Last week, he wrote on social media that he preferred a deal with Iran, but that if one could not be brokered, “we will just have to see what the outcome will be.” Countries in the region worry that a potential American strike, and an Iranian retaliation that could draw in Israel, could destabilize the Middle East and endanger U.S. allies in the Arab world that host American soldiers. In a speech on Tuesday shortly after the talks began, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, responded defiantly to Mr. Trump’s orders to send a second aircraft carrier to the region. “An aircraft carrier is certainly a dangerous piece of equipment,” the ayatollah said. “But more dangerous than the carrier is the weapon that can send it to the bottom of the sea.” He also called demands to limit the range of Iran’s ballistic missiles “illogical,” arguing that such demands interfered with his nation’s right to possess weapons of self-defense. “Any country without deterrent weapons will be crushed under the feet of its enemies,” he said. On Tuesday, Iranian naval forces closed parts of the Strait of Hormuz, a key global shipping lane, for several hours to conduct a second day of naval “war games,” according to the semiofficial Tasnim news agency. The Iranian government is under considerable pressure to agree to a deal. Iran’s economy has struggled under crippling international sanctions, which helped ignite the latest wave of protests against the country’s authoritarian government. Iranian officials have argued they will not make concessions on nuclear enrichment without sanctions relief. Iran’s deputy foreign minister told state media that in return Tehran could offer Washington lucrative investment opportunities in sectors like oil, gas and mining. Last year, U.S. and Iranian officials tried to negotiate a nuclear deal that would end the sanctions, but Israel launched a military campaign against the Iranian nuclear program as the talks were underway, leading to a 12-day war between the two countries. U.S. stealth bombers joined the Israeli assault, attacking three Iranian nuclear sites. Mr. Trump initially said that the U.S. bombing had obliterated Iran’s nuclear program, but American intelligence later said that it had been badly damaged , not destroyed. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who met with Mr. Trump last week in Washington, said on Sunday that the American president believed that Iran “must surely understand that they missed out last time” by not showing more flexibility in the 2025 talks. “He thinks there is a serious probability that they won’t miss out this time,” Mr. Netanyahu told a group of American Jewish leaders in Jerusalem, although he added that he was far more skeptical of “any deal with Iran.” Tyler Pager contributed reporting from Washington, and Farnaz Fassihi from New York.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT A senior official for Gaza on President Trump’s “Board of Peace” met with a top Hamas leader last week and pressed the militant group on the issue of disarmament, according to two officials briefed on the encounter, amid concern that Israel may return to war. The direct talks between Nickolay Mladenov, a former United Nations envoy serving as the board’s “high representative” for Gaza, and Khalil al-Hayya, the chief Hamas negotiator, underscored that the group remains a key actor in Gaza’s postwar transition. The board, a new international body with a mandate to secure peace in conflict zones, is set to have its inaugural meeting in Washington on Thursday. Officials from the board are finalizing a demilitarization plan that they hope will be acceptable to both Israel and Hamas, allowing the group to keep some small arms , at least initially. Yet Mr. al-Hayya refused to discuss demilitarization with Mr. Mladenov, the officials said, during their meeting in Cairo. It was unclear why he did not engage on the subject. In an interview with Al Jazeera that aired on Dec. 10, Khaled Meshal, a Qatar-based Hamas leader, said that to take away weapons from Palestinians was to take away their soul. Mr. Trump’s 20-point peace plan , which paved the way for the October cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, calls on the group to give up its weapons, but members of its leadership have not publicly agreed to that demand. On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested that if Hamas failed to give up its weapons, Israel would refuse to move to the next phase of the cease-fire. That phase is widely expected to involve Israel further withdrawing its forces from Gaza and facilitating efforts for reconstruction in the territory. “Hamas must first be disarmed and then Gaza must be demilitarized,” Mr. Netanyahu told a conference in Jerusalem, adding that the group still holds 60,000 Kalashnikov assault rifles. Yossi Fuchs, the Israeli government’s cabinet secretary, said on Monday that if Hamas does not disarm, the military will need to return to “complete the mission” in Gaza. In the past, talks between Hamas and the United States have mostly been conducted through Qatari and Egyptian mediators. The direct talks suggest that Board of Peace officials are urgently pushing for a breakthrough on demilitarization. A representative for Mr. Mladenov did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Hamas’s media office. Mr. Mladenov was asked on Friday about demilitarization while speaking at the Munich Security Conference and said, “The reality is that all of this needs to move very fast.” He went on to say there was a risk the cease-fire could collapse, leading to a return to war. Image Nickolay Mladenov, a former United Nations envoy serving as the board’s “high representative” for Gaza, talking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month. Credit... Evan Vucci/Associated Press For Hamas, armed struggle against Israel is a core part of its ideology, and even discussing demilitarization has caused fissures among the group. Despite the apparent deadlock, Mr. Trump has projected optimism about the Board of Peace’s efforts in Gaza. Writing on social media on Sunday, he said that member states had pledged more than $5 billion toward “Humanitarian and Reconstruction efforts” and committed thousands of troops “to maintain Security and Peace for Gazans.” Senior officials from board member states are expected to announce pledges at the inaugural meeting later this week and discuss the humanitarian situation in Gaza. More than 20 countries have so far joined the board. Some European countries have expressed reservations about the board’s mandate, which extends to conflicts beyond Gaza, and U.S. allies including the United Kingdom and Germany have declined an invitation to join. Analysts have cautioned that the president may be attempting to establish a rival to the United Nations, with himself at the helm. Aaron Boxerman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Dressed all in black with her dark hair pulled tightly into a bun, the Russian teenager many in the figure skating world have been wondering about finally showed up in Milan on Monday. A day before she began competition at the Winter Olympics, the young woman, 18-year-old Adeliia Petrosian, practiced for the first time at the official training rink. A swarm of camera lenses followed her as she glided across the ice. She landed jump after jump, easily turning her 5-foot body into a tiny rotating rocket. Afterward, she scurried past reporters, stopping only long enough to say in Russian, “Mood is excellent!” As the Olympic women’s figure skating competition begins on Tuesday, Petrosian is a contender for the gold medal — under the cloud of the biggest doping scandal in her sport’s history. Yet she is relatively unknown outside Russia because the country’s athletes were barred from international competition in 2022 over its invasion of Ukraine. The Winter Games will be just her second senior-level event outside Russia since then. “I can tell you that none of us have any idea how she will do, and she doesn’t have any idea, either,” said Adam Rippon, who won Olympic bronze for the United States in 2018 and coached at the 2022 Beijing Games. “But it’s kind of sad to think about that, if she does win a medal, how that will reflect on the sport.” Petrosian has the résumé of a potential medalist: Three-time and reigning Russian women’s national champion. A history of landing quadruple jumps, the hardest in skating. A coach who churns out Olympic champions, including Russians who have won gold at the last three Winter Games. But that coach was also at the center of scandal four years ago , when one of her charges, the 15-year-old Russian skater Kamila Valieva, failed a drug test and threw the Beijing Olympics into chaos. Valieva, one of Petrosian’s training mates, tested positive for the heart medication trimetazidine, which is banned because it is thought to increase stamina and endurance. She claimed that her grandfather had accidentally contaminated her strawberry dessert with his medication. Her failed drug test led to Russia being stripped of the team gold medal, and she served a four-year ban for doping. Even though Valieva was underage at the time, the rest of her team — including her coach, Eteri Tutberidze, and her choreographer, Daniil Gleikhengauz — were spared punishment. Image Eteri Tutberidze, right, and Daniil Gleikhengauz, who is listed as Petrosian’s official coach at the Olympics. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times There is no record of Petrosian testing positive and she has not been implicated in doping. But she and Valieva shared the same coaches, choreographer and training site in Moscow, where, according to findings by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, a medical team administered 56 different medications and dietary supplements to Valieva over two years, starting when she was 13. Now Petrosian is carrying the hopes of her country, one that is eager to re-enter the Olympic fold and rebound from a series of sanctions that have been imposed on it since the revelation of a government-sponsored doping scheme at the 2014 Winter Games. She is the sole Russian skater in the women’s event, but she isn’t officially representing her country. She is competing as a “neutral athlete,” like 13 other Russians at the Games. Though some international sports federations stood by their bans on Russian athletes for the Olympics in Italy, the International Skating Union, figure skating’s governing body, allowed two Russians to compete as neutrals: Petrosian and Petr Gumennik, who finished sixth in the men’s event last week. Last September, Petrosian won an Olympic qualifying event in Beijing, her international debut as a senior-level skater. Her choreographer, Gleikhengauz, was barred from that event for failing to pass the I.S.U. screening for neutrality, which means that it found indications that he supported the invasion of Ukraine, according to a person with knowledge of the ban who was not authorized to speak on behalf of the federation. Tutberidze did not apply to be Petrosian’s coach at that event or at the Olympics, the person said. An International Olympic Committee panel subsequently cleared Petrosian and Gleikhengauz to participate in the Milan-Cortina Games, where he is her official coach, according to the I.O.C. The organization did not immediately return a request for comment about why it cleared Gleikhengauz to coach in Milan after the I.S.U. had not cleared him for the qualifying event. Madison Chock and Evan Bates, the U.S. ice dancing team that won silver in Milan last week, were not awarded their gold medal for the team event in 2022 until the Summer Games two years later because Valieva’s doping case dragged on so long. But Bates said he supported the inclusion of Russian athletes at these Olympics. “In the spirit of the Games and fair play, I think there should be, in some regard, an avenue for those kinds of athletes,” he said. Still, skepticism surrounds Petrosian’s participation. Before she entered the Olympic drug-testing pool last May, the Russian antidoping agency was responsible for testing her for performance-enhancing drugs, the international skating federation said. But the World Anti-Doping Agency, the global body charged with ensuring fair competition in Olympic sports, does not recognize the Russian agency because it has failed to follow WADA rules. Image Adeliia Petrosian at the Russian Figure Skating Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, last year. Credit... Anton Vaganov/Reuters Since last May, Petrosian also has been drug tested by the International Testing Agency, which was formed after Russia’s state-sponsored cheating program was uncovered and is also responsible for testing athletes during the Games, the I.S.U. said. But some experts say questions around Petrosian and some other Russian athletes remain because the effects of doping can last years. “Russia remains noncompliant with WADA rules for its state-sponsored doping, but their athletes get waived through to the Games?” said Travis Tygart, chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency. “It’s exactly why athletes, fans and sponsors have lost confidence.” Tutberidze, a dual citizen of Russia and Georgia, is officially the coach of a male Georgian skater in Milan. But she was at the practice rink on Monday when Petrosian skated, looking very much like her coach. Witold Banka, the president of WADA, said that there was no legal basis to bar Tutberidze from coaching in Milan because an investigation into Valieva’s entourage found no proof of wrongdoing. But he added: “I don’t feel comfortable with her presence here.” Tutberidze, who ignored several interview requests, has a reputation for pushing young skaters so hard that they burn out early and sustain injuries, and for berating Valieva on live television four years ago. Entangled in the doping scandal, Valieva stumbled through her long program at the Beijing Games and finished in tears. Television cameras captured the moments afterward, when a grim-faced Tutberidze offered the teen scathing words. “Why did you stop fighting?” she said. Thomas Bach, the I.O.C. president at the time, said he was “very, very disturbed” to see Valieva being treated with “such coldness.” Image Kamila Valieva with her coach, Tutberidze, before her performance at the 2022 Beijing Olympics. Credit... Chang W. Lee/The New York Times In interviews and on social media, Petrosian has had nothing but praise for her coaches. She and Gleikhengauz were featured in a recent Russian edition of Marie Claire magazine, in which they discussed fashion — Petrosian’s style trends toward that of Audrey Hepburn and of Zendaya — and the importance of trust between an athlete and coach. Petrosian said she had dreamed of training with Tutberidze and her staff before she joined them at about age 12, and that",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT A judge in New Zealand who discovered last week that apology letters from a defendant in an arson case had been written with the help of artificial intelligence raised questions about the sincerity of her sentiments. “The issue of remorse is interesting,” said the judge, Tom Gilbert, of the district court in Christchurch, as he mulled the punishment of a woman who had pleaded guilty to arson and other charges. Remorse can be a mitigating factor in sentencing. Her letters to the victims and the court were nicely written, the judge said. He decided to do some sleuthing. “Out of curiosity I punched into two A.I. tools ‘draft me a letter for a judge expressing remorse for my offending,’” the judge said, according to a transcript of the sentencing hearing that was shared with The New York Times. “It became immediately apparent that these were two A.I.-generated letters, albeit with tweaks around the edges.” The case illustrates a global debate about using machines for meaningful communication. Judge Gilbert said he was not criticizing the defendant’s use of A.I. “But certainly when one is considering the genuineness of an individual’s remorse, simply producing a computer-generated letter does not really take me anywhere as far as I am concerned,” he said, according to the transcript. The judge was not alone in wrestling with the question of authenticity in A.I.-assisted writing in the case before him, which was initially reported by The New Zealand Herald . Increasingly, people are outsourcing many tasks to machines, including writing apologies , eulogies and wedding vows , perhaps saving precious time but also inviting the ire of some of their fellow humans. Growing reliance on A.I. has led some cultural commentators to bemoan “ the rise of the LLeMmings,” people who depend on large language models known as LLMs to aid much of their thinking and production, including in their personal lives . Social scientists say the questions raised by use of these tools go beyond etiquette. “It’s a mirror into who we are and what we care about as humans,” Jim A.C. Everett, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Kent in Britain, said in an email about the case in New Zealand and his own work on what is described as the “outsourcing penalty.” Dr. Everett worked on a series of recent studies on the perception of A.I. use and users. Generative A.I. tools like ChatGPT are promoted as time savers that produce better work faster, experts say. But people apparently believe that certain activities should take work in order to seem genuine, and more personal A.I.-generated efforts are received particularly poorly, his research suggests. Across the six studies Dr. Everett worked on, 4,000 participants were asked about 20 tasks — including writing computer code, concocting recipes and drafting love letters and apologies. The aim was to understand how people perceive those who use A.I. and how that perception might shift depending on the activity and the way the tools were used. “A.I. is a tool for efficiency, and it can be helpful, but it also typically involves, and signals, reduced effort,” Dr. Everett said. But the use of such tools acts as a kind of proxy for character traits, the researchers found. The findings, published in the journal Computers in Human Behavior , suggest that people generally perceived those using A.I. as lazier, less competent and less trustworthy, and their work as less meaningful and authentic. “When you spend time crafting a piece of writing or completing a task yourself, others can assume that message reflects your priorities: that what you write is authentically yours and represents what you care about,” Dr. Everett said. The situation in the New Zealand courtroom was a real-life test of the sentiments and perceptions that he and his fellow researchers sought to identify and understand. “An A.I. could be perfectly trained on all apologies that a person has ever written, but one might still think that a specific apology it then generates in a new instance is not an authentic apology because it does not come from the kind of processes deemed important in an apology: a personal recollection of the wrong, a commitment to change,” the study said. The study detected a difference in how people perceived using A.I. for social tasks, like writing a love letter, versus a practical tasks, like writing computer code. The more personal a task the more negative was their impression. Judge Gilbert ultimately said he was willing to give the defendant some credit for genuine remorse, looking beyond the letters. But he granted only a 5 percent reduction in the sentence instead of the 10 percent the defense lawyer had requested based on the defendant’s remorse. “I do not consider this is a case where 10 percent is justified and, indeed, 5 percent might be viewed as reasonably generous,” Judge Gilbert concluded. In the end, he sentenced the defendant to 27 months in prison. Ephrat Livni is a Times reporter covering breaking news around the world. She is based in Washington.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Belgium’s government summoned President Trump’s ambassador after he accused his host nation of an antisemitic action and criticized a Belgian official in a series of posts on social media. The meeting on Tuesday between the ambassador, Bill White, and a representative from Belgium’s foreign office came at a moment of heightened tension as the Trump administration paints governments across Europe as out of line with American values. Mr. White criticized Belgium on Monday on social media over an investigation in Antwerp into a few Jewish mohels who perform ritual circumcision, and who the authorities say may be carrying out procedures without medical training . Mr. White wrote on X that Belgium should drop what he called a “RIDICULOUS AND ANTI SEMITIC ‘PROSECUTION.’” He tagged Mr. Trump and the American vice president and the secretary of state, among others. “You must make a legal provision to allow Jewish religious MOHELS to perform their duties here in Belgium,” Mr. White added, addressing the Belgian health minister. Circumcision is far less common in Europe than in the United States and Israel and different countries regulate it in different ways. In Belgium, laws mandate that all medical procedures must be performed by a licensed doctor, said Arne Brinckman, a representative for Belgium’s health minister. The Antwerp public prosecutor’s office put out a news release about the case in May and confirmed on Tuesday that the investigation was continuing. Kristof Aerts, a representative for the office, did not elaborate but noted that there were no “ongoing prosecutions.” Maxime Prévot, Belgium’s foreign minister, responded at length to Mr. White on X, saying that “personal attacks against a Belgian minister and interference in judicial matters violate basic diplomatic norms.” “Any suggestion that Belgium is antisemitic is false, offensive, and unacceptable,” Mr. Prévot wrote in the post, on Monday evening. A statement from the Belgian foreign ministry after the meeting — which included Mr. White and Theodora Gentzis, the secretary general of the Belgian foreign ministry — underlined its stance. Mr. Prévot was not present because he is traveling, Mr. White said and Mr. Prévot’s office confirmed. “Belgium attaches great importance to its relations with the United States of America. This partnership remains essential and we remain open to dialogue,” the statement said. “However, this dialogue must be based on respect for our institutions and our sovereignty.” On Tuesday morning, Gideon Sa’ar, Israel’s foreign minister, also weighed in on social media. “I understand that the mirror Ambassador @BillWhiteUSA has held up to you is unpleasant, but one might want to take this opportunity to take a hard look in that mirror and acknowledge reality,” he wrote. Mr. White said in an interview that he does not think Belgium is antisemitic. He said he had previously held private conversations about the issue with Belgian officials, and was frustrated by the slow progress. He said that he does not want the government to interfere in the judicial system by forcing it to drop the case, but that he would like government officials to speak in support of the men under investigation. Most governments in Europe and other democracies avoid becoming involved in their judicial systems, out of deference to judicial independence. Mr. White noted that Charles Kushner, Mr. Trump’s ambassador to France, faced a similar summons last year after complaining about what Mr. Kushner characterized as France’s failure to stem antisemitism in a letter to President Emmanuel Macron. The French foreign ministry denied the accusations. Mr. White said his own meeting with the foreign ministry was “very nice.” “I did not apologize for anything,” Mr. White said. “Nor would I.” Jeanna Smialek is the Brussels bureau chief for The Times.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Palmerston, a cat who served as the “chief mouser” for Britain’s diplomatic service, has died in Bermuda. He was about 12. “Palmerston, Diplocat extraordinaire, passed away peacefully,” his social media account announced on Friday , a day after he died. “He was a wonderful companion, with a gentle nature, and will be sorely missed.” “Farewell Palmerston, with love and thanks,” the Foreign Office wrote in a separate tribute on social media, acknowledging his work as a “feline diplomat.” Palmerston was born in 2013, according to the Foreign Office, and was named after Lord Palmerston, the 19th-century foreign secretary and two-time prime minister. The cat was adopted in 2016 from the Battersea Cats and Dogs Home, an animal rescue center in London, after he had spent a rough time on the streets: “He was hungry, underweight and had no microchip,” the BBC reported . He was initially tasked with dealing with mice in the Foreign Office’s Victorian-era headquarters in London, one of the British government’s grandest buildings. But he became a social media star, eventually amassing almost 100,000 followers on X — more than many British ambassadors have. He even dressed for the part. Famously, he never took off his tuxedo. A few months after Palmerston was adopted, Britain voted to leave the European Union, a decision that led to a period of political turmoil. On the ground, Palmerston kept calm and carried on catching mice. On social media, he was a friendly face for the country through his regular updates. During the coronavirus pandemic, Palmerston was eventually moved out of central London and formally retired to the countryside in 2020, with Andrew Murdoch, who worked in the Foreign Office alongside the cat. In Palmerston’s farewell letter to Simon McDonald, then the top civil servant at the Foreign Office, Palmerston revealed himself to be a master diplomat or even spy by admitting to “pretending to be asleep while overhearing all the foreign dignitaries’ conversations.” Last February, Palmerston wrote on X that he had come out of retirement to take up a new posting as a “feline relations consultant” in Bermuda with Mr. Murdoch. It was a good gig for an aging cat. Palmerston described his work as “feline relations consultant (semi-retired).” There, he “gave audiences to visitors between well-deserved naps,” the office of the governor said on social media . Many will miss him. But perhaps no one understood him better than Larry the Cat , the chief mouser at No. 10 Downing Street, the prime minister’s official residence, who has almost 900,000 followers on social media. At first, the two did not get along. Video footage taken soon after Palmerston arrived at the Foreign Office showed the cats in the sort of heated confrontation more commonly seen between politicians than civil servants. Larry was once spotted with a limp after reports that Palmerston had clawed him. But the two appeared to have repaired their relationship after Palmerston moved out of London. Last week, Larry joined the nation in mourning his old rival after a life of service for Queen, King and country. “Farewell old friend,” he wrote on social media.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Ukrainian and Russian officials began a new round of U.S.-brokered peace talks on Tuesday in Switzerland, though hopes of a breakthrough to end the war were low. Fighting rages on, past negotiations have produced little, and major hurdles to a deal are unresolved. The talks, which were held Tuesday afternoon and will run through Wednesday, were the third trilateral meeting between Ukrainian, Russian and American negotiators in roughly three weeks. Ukraine and Russia have described two previous rounds of discussions in the United Arab Emirates as productive. But those talks delivered scant progress beyond a prisoner-of-war exchange. The conflict will enter its fifth year later this month as Russia continues to strike Ukraine’s power grid , including in an attack on Tuesday involving nearly 40 missiles and 400 drones, according to the Ukrainian Air Force . Kyiv and Moscow are still far apart on the core obstacles to a peace deal: the fate of Ukrainian-held territory in the east that Russia wants — an issue expected to dominate this week’s talks — and the question of postwar Western security guarantees to deter another Russian invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine underscored those differences in social media posts on Monday, warning that it would be “a big mistake to allow the aggressor to take something” — an apparent reference to Russia’s demand for the eastern territories. He also urged the United States to advance work on security guarantees, which has been complicated by Moscow’s insistence that such guarantees must exclude Western troop deployments in Ukraine. Rustem Umerov, the head of the Ukrainian delegation and the secretary of the country’s National Security Council, published pictures on social media that showed him seated at a table with other Ukrainian officials, including Kyrylo Budanov , Mr. Zelensky’s chief of staff. To their right, according to the pictures, sat American mediators, including Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s special envoy; and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law. Both had just wrapped up talks focused on Iran that were also held in Geneva. Facing the Ukrainians was the Russian delegation, which included Vladimir Medinsky, a top Kremlin aide, as well as military intelligence figures, according to the pictures. The presence of Mr. Medinsky, a former culture minister and amateur historian who led negotiations for Moscow last year , has been seen by some in Ukraine as a discouraging signal. In previous talks, Mr. Medinsky grated on his Ukrainian counterparts with lengthy historical lectures and a hard-line stance, warning that Russia was prepared to keep fighting indefinitely. Image From right, President Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, the president’s special envoy, in Paris last month. Credit... Michel Euler/Associated Press Mr. Medinsky was absent from the two trilateral meetings this year in the United Arab Emirates, where Russia was represented by security and military intelligence officials — a shift that Ukrainian officials said helped improve the tone of the talks. “These are different people, and there were no more pseudohistorical lectures,” Andrii Sybiha, Ukraine’s foreign minister, told Ukrainian media last month after the first trilateral meeting. “The conversations were very focused.” Those meetings focused on the mechanics of a cease-fire and how it would be monitored by the United States, Mr. Zelensky told Bloomberg last week. They did not appear to address the bigger sticking points related to territorial issues and security guarantees — which analysts said may explain why the talks were described as constructive . Mr. Zelensky told Bloomberg that this week’s negotiations would most likely center on the territorial issue. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, confirmed as much on Monday in a call with reporters, adding that the change in focus had prompted the return of Mr. Medinsky as “the chief negotiator.” Officials from Britain, France, Germany and Italy also took part in Tuesday’s talks, though they were not expected to engage with the Russian delegation, according to a Kyiv-based European diplomat. European countries have largely been sidelined in the peace negotiations, even though the war is unfolding on their continent. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has insisted that the war would not end unless Ukraine cedes the portion of the eastern Donetsk region it still controls — roughly 2,000 square miles of land, about the size of Delaware. Mr. Zelensky has repeatedly said Russia’s territorial demand was a nonstarter. But he has signaled openness to compromise, suggesting a demilitarized zone in Donetsk where both Ukrainian and Russian troops would pull back from an equal portion of territory. Polls in Ukraine also show a growing acceptance of territorial concessions among a war-weary public. Russia has long asserted that its slow but steady advance on the battlefield means Ukraine would be better off agreeing to a deal that includes territorial concessions now, rather than having Kyiv lose land later in bloody fighting. Ukraine, by contrast, has sought to maximize the cost of Russia’s advance by inflicting as many casualties on its troops as possible. Counterattacks over the past week have allowed Ukrainian troops to regain some positions in the east along the Haichul River, which serves as a natural barrier to Russian advances, according to battlefield maps and military analysts. But Ukrainian officials said this month that the Trump administration was ramping up pressure on them to make concessions, in a push to end the war by early summer .

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Prosecutors in Austria said on Monday that they had filed terrorism and other charges against a 21-year-old man they said was a member of a terrorist group that was planning an attack on a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna in 2024. The suspect, who was not publicly identified, professed his allegiance to the Islamic State group online, prosecutors said. The attack was thwarted but worries over safety led to the cancellation of three shows the artist had planned in Austria. The main aim was to attack the concert, according to prosecutors, who also accused the man of downloading instructions from ISIS for a shrapnel bomb “specifically designed” for terror attacks. The suspect was charged with receiving instructions on handling and using the materials, the Vienna Public Prosecutor’s Office said . The man is also accused of having repeatedly tried to buy firearms and a hand grenade, and instructing illegal dealers to import the weapons into Austria. The suspect, who has been in custody since August 2024, faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted, prosecutors said. The initial tip about a threat against Ms. Swift’s concerts came from American intelligence , Austrian officials have said. The shows were part of Ms. Swift’s Eras tour, and had been expected to draw tens of thousands of fans. The threat followed deadly attacks on concert halls. In 2015, an ISIS attack on a Paris concert hall and other sites killed 130 people , and in 2017, an attack on an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, killed at least 22 people . The bomber in the Manchester attack, who died in the assault, had links to ISIS . Prosecutors in Germany last year charged a Syrian teenager living in Germany with helping plot the thwarted Vienna concert attack. In that case, prosecutors accused the teenager, whom they identified only as Mohammad A. in keeping with privacy rules, of helping interpret Arabic-language bomb-building instructions and of translating an oath of allegiance to ISIS for the main suspect in the Austria plot. The teen was about 14 years old when the plot was thwarted, and he was convicted and given an 18-month suspended sentence under juvenile criminal law. Christopher F. Schuetze contributed reporting.

      "content": "The Syrian Army has moved into vast new regions, seeking to erase the largest fissure left from the civil war. They have encountered a land in desperate need and deeply divided after years of fighting. The advance has left ethnic Kurds fearful and wary. It has dashed their dream of autonomy in northeastern Syria. Their lingering defiance may point to challenges ahead. The mood was tense as government forces entered the city of Hasakah in northeastern Syria this month. U.S.-led coalition warplanes flew overhead, and a Syrian Army unit monitored the column’s progress from drones, watching for ambush by Kurdish groups. It was the first time the government was moving into Hasakah, a stronghold of the Kurds for more than a decade, and its presence was not welcomed by all. Kurdish soldiers, who are being made to abandon their ambition for an autonomous region, remained defiant, parading with Kurdish flags and weapons before a government base. The display indicated the challenges ahead for President Ahmed al-Sharaa. Benefiting from a switch in American support away from the Kurds, he has used a mixture of muscle and negotiation in recent weeks to take over three provinces of eastern Syria. The vast, resource-rich region had eluded his grasp since his rebel force toppled the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad just over a year ago. His new government is now extending its authority, advancing toward its goal of unifying Syria for the first time in 15 years. The task before him is daunting. Already stretched with stabilizing the war-battered country and lifting its people out of poverty, the government now has a huge new area of territory to secure and rebuild.

During a two-week long journey across the newly opened territory, our reporting team encountered a land in desperate need and deeply divided after years of civil conflict. The Kurds, a minority in Syria, are the dominant population in parts of northeast Syria, and they were by turns wary, resistant and resigned at the prospect of rule from Damascus. Arab residents, who had chafed under the rule of the Kurdish-led force, the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., were celebratory. Some had rushed back to reclaim their homes, even as army units were clearing mines and booby traps left by departing Kurdish forces. “The entire village was displaced in 2013,” said Ahmed al-Ahmad, 40, who had returned from Lebanon and was repairing his house in the village of Al Belasha, in the newly controlled areas of Aleppo province. “Not even a bird could fly here.” The infrastructure demands are immense. The area’s hydroelectric dams, oil fields and rich farming land are debilitated. Much of the countryside lies in darkness. Cities are strewed with trash. Power is so intermittent that neighborhoods roar with the sound of generators. In the provincial capital of Raqqa, cars bumped through potholes filled with muddy rainwater.

Security forces were still searching underground tunnels for explosives and S.D.F. stragglers, said Ahmed Adel, the acting head of the government’s Internal Security forces in Raqqa. “Once we have security,” Mr. Adel said, “we can sort out everything else.” Government officials said they have learned from the experience of taking over the rest of the country after the fall of the Assad regime in December 2024.

Government delegations have been arriving from Damascus to assess the region’s needs, but residents are already complaining about rising gas prices. With the departure of the S.D.F., thousands who had built an economy linked to the force and its administration were now without jobs. In northeastern Syria, the S.D.F. was more than a fighting force but a veritable government of its own. It had been the main ally working with U.S. forces in the area for more than a decade in combating the terrorist group Islamic State and guarding thousands of ISIS prisoners. The Kurds had long wanted their own autonomous region there. But in recent weeks, the Trump administration withdrew its support from the Kurds and threw it behind Mr. al-Sharaa in his aim to unite Syria under his rule. Some Kurds saw the shift as a betrayal. Without American backing, the Kurdish force could not hold their neighborhoods in the city of Aleppo, and had little hope of controlling the mainly Arab populated provinces of Raqqa and Deir al Zour. Some Kurdish fighters in Aleppo chose to make a last stand. After days of fighting, the bulk of the fighters and their political leaders withdrew to Hasakah, a largely Kurdish region. The government has now entered there, too. Image Mines collected from recently captured territory, near the Tishreen Dam.

Image Billboards honoring Kurdish fighters killed during the battle for the Sheikh Maqsoud neighborhood in Aleppo and leaders of the Kurdish struggle across the region. People living in the mainly Arab populated provinces wrested from the S.D.F. complained that the Kurdish-led force had run a harsh police state. “We were always in fear they would raid our shop. We knew anyone could charge us with being an ISIS fighter,” said Belal Bargash, 32, standing outside his cellphone shop in a part of Deir al Zour province that had been controlled by the Kurdish-led force. “We feel extremely relieved,” he said, breaking into a beaming smile. Some Kurds in the region said that they, too, had felt oppressed by the S.D.F.’s administration. Ayman Lolak, 43, a Kurdish businessman in the Sheikh Maqsoud neighborhood of Aleppo, which the S.D.F. had lost, said he was pleased finally to be reconnected to the rest of the city and to the central government. He said the Kurdish administration had confiscated his line of shops and other properties near the front line and allowed him only the use of one shop and one house. “We were under a blockade for the last year,” he said. “Now it’s open and we can import and export goods.” Image Local residents on the formerly S.D.F.-controlled side of the Euphrates River, opposite Deir al Zour.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Just about everyone close to Tshephiso Marumo condemned her when she chose to sell ears of corn door-to-door a decade ago after earning an honors degree from a university in her native Botswana. It was the sort of thing that people in the southern African nation looked down upon as poor people’s work, not something for a sophisticated graduate with dreams of becoming a journalist. One of her former professors was so dismayed that he derisively nicknamed her Mmammidi, a Setswana term that roughly translates to Corn Lady. Ms. Marumo, 33, shrugged off the criticism and has since turned that humble beginning into what many people in Botswana call a tale of triumph and inspiration: She has opened two roadside food stalls in the capital, Gaborone, that have become a hit, selling traditional village cooking that you almost never find in urban areas. Her venture has turned the unglamorous work of roadside food vending into something fashionable, earning her a large social media following and prominent customers, including politicians, musicians and influencers. Video Food being prepared in Ms. Marumo’s backyard. Yet the same qualities that have aided Ms. Marumo’s rise — persistence, candor and stubbornness — have also made her a divisive figure. The more prominent she has become, the louder she has spoken out online about hot-button issues, like parenting and drug addiction, earning her a reputation among some as a social media bully. On Facebook , one of Botswana’s primary social media platforms, Ms. Marumo has more than 240,000 followers, the equivalent of nearly 10 percent of Botswana’s population. She called the business Mmammidi, after the former professor’s nickname, and plastered it onto T-shirts, aprons and two company cars. “There are so many things I have done, but they have never given me a brand or a name or an identity,” she said. “But through the corn, I got an identity.” Ms. Marumo likes to say she sparked controversy even before she was born. Her mother became pregnant with her as a teenager, upsetting many family members. Growing up, Ms. Marumo bounced between Gaborone, where her mother worked as a police officer, and Kalamare, a village three hours away where she stayed with her grandmother. Her grandmother ran an illegal tavern out of their home, something that was frowned upon in the community. But Ms. Marumo said she had no shame in the family business because she was always well taken care of. Her grandmother taught her how to cook, and that interest grew when she took home economics in school. Image Ms. Marumo makes traditional food, including a shredded beef dish known as seswaa and bogobe jwa lerotse, a thick porridge of sorghum and melon juice. Ms. Marumo started her cooking business after building a following with her corn sales. She began hosting dinners at her home, cooking Tswana food in the traditional style — in three-legged cast iron pots over a wood-fired flame. The dishes are seasoned mostly with just salt and natural fats, a traditional technique meant to bring out the true flavors of the meats, starches and vegetables. Her dinners became so popular, she said, that in late 2019 she cleared out a bushy field at a busy intersection near her home and set up her first food stall. Offering village cooking on a street corner near Gaborone’s central business district, Ms. Marumo’s enterprise was a welcome departure for many locals from the usual fare of westernized food showered in spices served up by chain restaurants. “I’m passionate about my heritage, where I’m from and what my ancestors consumed before me,” a satisfied Orebotse Makgolo, 37, said after eating at Ms. Marumo’s stall for the first time recently. “Unfortunately, we consume a lot of western food, and it’s always nice to be in touch with the local side of yourself.” In January, Ms. Marumo opened a second food stall. Both are unfussy stands made of wood with flat, tin-sheet roofs sitting on dirt lots. She now employs 11 workers. They come to her modest bungalow every morning at 6, where they fire up about 30 pots under a shelter in the backyard, cooking the day’s menu in a swirl of heat and eye-burning smoke. The result on a recent day was a spread that included a shredded beef dish known as seswaa , a similar version mixed with tripe called mokoto and bogobe jwa lerotse , a thick porridge of sorghum and melon juice. Image Ms. Marumo’s dinners became so popular that in late 2019, she cleared out a bushy field at a busy intersection near her home and set up her first food stall. Two years ago, Ms. Marumo ventured into a new enterprise, holding the first of what she said would be annual women’s empowerment seminars. But given her reputation as an online bully, many are unconvinced that Ms. Marumo is a true champion of women. On social media, she has criticized how some mothers raise their children and questioned the wisdom of some people’s decision to have children in the first place. Online commenters have, in turn, attacked Ms. Marumo with negative comments about her body. They have criticized her food as “soily,” meaning it tastes like dirt. Thato San, a Botswana native who owns a beauty brand, said she was shocked last year when Ms. Marumo suggested online that Ms. San may have been complicit in the drug addiction of one of her friends, a rapper who had recently died. Just months earlier, Ms. San said, she had nominated Ms. Marumo for special recognition at a Women’s Month brunch. “It was disappointing because I looked up to her,” she said. “Her presence on social media, a lot of people would say is very, very negative.” Ms. Marumo argues that she is misunderstood and that her words are often twisted. Her success, she said, had bred contempt and made people feel that they could say anything about her. She feels compelled to speak about women’s issues because of her own experience overcoming doubters, she said. Mothers often contact her for help with their children, and she has volunteered with and raised funds for an orphanage — experiences that Ms. Marumo said have given her a motherly instinct, even though she does not have children of her own. “I am known by many people, but I’m still human,” she said. “I want my freedom. I need my freedom of expression.” Image Enjoying lunch hour at one of the stalls. Ms. Marumo started her cooking business after building a following with her corn sales. Since college, Ms. Marumo has always done things her way, said Benah Sekgabo, who met her in 2011 when they studied together. Ms. Marumo had a unique hairstyle and would design her own shoes, earrings and clothes, saying that she couldn’t buy the same off-the-rack items as her classmates. The social media controversies don’t seem to have hurt business, so far. For some, Ms. Marumo’s brashness is part of her appeal. “She’s a very confident person,” said Losika Mooketsi, a 20-year-old accounting student as she tucked into a plate of Ms. Marumo’s stewed meat. “She doesn’t let anyone bring her down. People can start rumors about her, and she won’t let that faze her.” Behind the steely exterior, though, Ms. Marumo said the withering criticism can be painful. She starts each day reading the Bible and writing motivational messages on sticky notes, which now form a colorful collage on her bedroom door. “Pray for those who have caused me pain,” reads one note. “Thank you God for P1,000,000,” says another, a reference to her goal of earning at least a million Pula (about $76,000), which she said she was still working toward. And then there’s one from a popular Psalm that might sum up her approach to life: “I will fear no evil.” Image Ms. Marumo. “I am known by many people, but I’m still human,” she said. “I want my freedom.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT An architect of Virginia’s aggressive redistricting scheme will announce on Wednesday that he intends to run for one of the newly drawn Democratic seats himself. Dan Helmer, a four-term state delegate who played a key behind-the-scenes role in last October’s surprise move to redraw Virginia’s congressional maps , is entering the race for the lobster-shaped Seventh Congressional District that will be created if voters approve a constitutional amendment to allow for mid-decade redistricting. A top ally to Don Scott, the Virginia House speaker, Mr. Helmer served as campaigns chairman for the Virginia House Democratic Caucus as the party took control of the chamber in 2023 and then flipped 13 more Republican-held seats last November. Last fall, Mr. Helmer helped devise and implement the redistricting strategy and then marshaled support in Richmond for the first set of votes on the amendment to redraw congressional maps. He later recused himself from the map-drawing process. “We need fighters with a proven track record of not just standing up but winning against Donald Trump and the Republican Congress to get our country back in the right direction,” Mr. Helmer said in an interview. “I’m a progressive fighter with an unmatched record of taking on Trump and winning.” The Seventh is one of four new districts likely to favor Democrats that would be created if Virginia voters pass the redistricting amendment on April 21. It begins at the Potomac River in Arlington and stretches west to the West Virginia border in one lobster claw and south past Richmond to rural Powhatan County, in the other. Vice President Kamala Harris won 54 percent of the vote there in 2024, and Joseph R. Biden Jr. took 56 percent in 2020. An Army veteran of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Mr. Helmer, 44, entered state politics in 2019 on a platform of gun control and abortion rights. He flipped the last Republican-held state House seat in Fairfax County, a Washington suburb that was then in the final stages of a transition from Republican territory to one that now votes for Democrats by large margins. Mr. Helmer is the second Democrat to enter the race, following J.P. Cooney, a top deputy to Jack Smith , the special prosecutor who twice indicted Mr. Trump. Image J.P. Cooney announced his candidacy last week. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times While Mr. Cooney, a career federal prosecutor, is a relative newcomer to Virginia politics, Mr. Helmer has run for Northern Virginia congressional seats twice before, losing in Democratic primaries in 2018 and 2024 . He has built a political base in Fairfax County and among the state’s power brokers in Richmond. Mr. Helmer enters the race with endorsements from former Gov. Ralph Northam; 43 of Virginia’s 84 other Democratic state legislators; and Representative Eugene Vindman, a Virginia Democrat whose current district covers much of the territory Mr. Helmer seeks to represent. “Dan Helmer delivered the largest Democratic majority in four decades,” Mr. Scott, the Virginia House speaker, said. “He whipped Virginia Republicans — Republicans in D.C. should be trembling in their orthopedic shoes.” Though Mr. Helmer helped to whip votes for the constitutional amendment last fall, he said he was not involved in drawing the proposed new maps, an assertion confirmed by several people involved. Still, there was a widespread belief among Virginia Democrats as the new maps were being debated that a new Democratic seat would be drawn for Mr. Helmer. Mr. Helmer said his primary role in drawing the new maps was leading the party’s campaign committee in the House of Delegates to elect new Democrats to the chamber. “There are 17 Republican-held seats that are now held by Democrats,” Mr. Helmer said. “That has allowed us to put redistricting in front of the people, and I’m convinced they will allow us to enact new maps.” Reid J.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Democrats knew in real time last year that they had bungled their response to President Trump’s address to a joint session of Congress, making themselves a distraction rather than offering a cohesive message of resistance to his policies. Representative Al Green, a liberal septuagenarian from Texas, was ejected from the chamber (and later censured) after disrupting the speech with a cane-waving tirade . The paddles that some Democrats waved with short messages on them — “Save Medicaid,” “Musk Steals” and one that just read “False” — were widely panned as a hokey and incoherent response. It was all out of step with the sober, centrist counter to Mr. Trump that party leaders had wanted to project that night. They’re trying something different on Tuesday, when Mr. Trump is scheduled to deliver the first State of the Union address of his second term. A substantial number of Democrats are planning to boycott the speech and attend an alternative event, a rally called the “People’s State of the Union,” which will take place on the National Mall near the Capitol. The event, which is being coordinated by the left-wing advocacy group MoveOn and MeidasTouch, a progressive media company, will feature Democratic lawmakers speaking with people who have been negatively affected by Mr. Trump’s economic and health care policies, as well as federal workers who lost their jobs and immigrants who have been targeted by the Trump administration. It will be hosted by the liberal political commentators Joy Reid and Katie Phang. “He’s made a mockery of the State of the Union speech and he doesn’t deserve an audience,” Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said of Mr. Trump in an interview, explaining why he planned to attend the rally instead of the speech. “He’s going to tell 40 different lies, call Democrats names; he’s going to paper over his corruption; and I don’t feel like what he’s doing dignifies having Democrats there to cloak the speech in a veneer of respectability.” Mr. Murphy, who also skipped the address last year, added: “These aren’t normal times, and we have to stop doing normal things.” Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, attended Mr. Trump’s speech last year but walked out before the end. (Last year, the president spoke for roughly 100 minutes.) This year, Mr. Van Hollen said, he won’t be going. “We cannot normalize this moment when Trump is marching our country toward fascism,” said Mr. Van Hollen, who will also speak at the rally. “I refuse to be a prop in the chamber as Donald Trump shreds our Constitution and attacks our democracy.” Image Representative Al Green yelled in protest as Mr. Trump addressed Congress last year. Credit... Kenny Holston/The New York Times It is unclear how many Democratic members of Congress will attend the speech. Some have expressed concern that boycotting en masse would leave Mr. Trump with a purely sycophantic audience. But even a sizable boycott would break with a tradition, which most Democrats adhered to even through the first Trump administration, of the opposing party dutifully sitting through a speech they mostly disagree with. Even when they registered their disapproval with acts of protest — like when former Speaker Nancy Pelosi ripped up Mr. Trump’s speech when he was finished delivering it — they mostly showed up. Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and minority leader, has encouraged members to either sit silently through the speech or boycott it altogether, rather than attend and create distractions in the House chamber. Mr. Jeffries on Tuesday said it was his “present intention” to attend. “We’re not going to his house, he’s coming to our house,” he told reporters at a news conference. “Having grown up where I grew up, you never let anyone run you off your block.” (Mr. Jeffries grew up in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn.) Lawmakers who are skipping the speech for the rally so far include Senators Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts and Tina Smith of Minnesota, as well as House Democrats including Representatives Becca Balint of Vermont, Greg Casar of Texas, Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Delia Ramirez of Illinois. Another contingent of lawmakers is expected to walk out of the address while Mr. Trump is speaking and make their way to the competing event. “We know that he is going to use the State of the Union to mislead the American people and lie,” said Sara Haghdoosti, the chief of program at MoveOn Civic Action. “We want to make sure we’re focusing on the impact his horrendous policies have had. We want to shift the focus from Trump’s lies to the stories of people.” Annie Karni is a congressional correspondent for The Times.

Image Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, during a Senate hearing last Thursday. Credit... Eric Lee for The New York Times The White House on Tuesday rejected the latest offer from Democratic lawmakers on proposed new constraints on federal immigration officers, the latest sign that there would not be a quick resolution of the stalemate that has left the Department of Homeland Security without funding since Saturday. A White House official who provided a statement on the condition of anonymity to describe private negotiations said the two parties were still far apart, adding that President Trump’s team remained interested in continuing good-faith talks to resolve the impasse. In response, aides for the Democratic leaders in Congress said that Republicans had largely ignored the guardrails the public was demanding, and urged them to start negotiating in good faith as they said their side had been doing. Both White House officials and Democrats on Capitol Hill have kept largely confidential the specifics of their offers to end the standoff that allowed funding for the agency to lapse as of 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The outlines of the Democratic demands, however, are well known: limits on masked police, an end to random sweeps, new requirements for judicial warrants, putting “sensitive locations” such as churches, schools, hospitals and polling places off limits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement among them. The offer was given to the White House Monday evening but brushed aside by the White House less than 24 hours later. “These are common sense,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said Sunday on CNN about the Democratic proposals. “Police departments across America use them. We have a rogue agency. Why don’t we rein them in? That’s what the American people are asking Republicans.” Democrats have portrayed the earlier White House counteroffer to Democrats, which has not been made public, as “nonserious.” People familiar with the talks have said that the White House has not been responsive to many of the Democratic demands for limits on federal immigration agents, and has pushed for new authority of its own, including increased penalties for those who dox officers. Some Republicans have also said that they want an end to local and state policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, sometimes called sanctuary city policies, in exchange for concessions. “When it comes to masks, I don’t know of another law enforcement agency in the country that has an 8,000-percent increase in threats,” Tom Homan, President Trump’s border czar, said Sunday on CBS News’s “Face the Nation.” “Just yesterday, the director of ICE, his wife was filmed walking to work. His home address has been doxed. His kids have been doxed and filmed.” With Congress on a weeklong recess and lawmakers scattered around the world and the nation, chances for approval of a funding agreement this week remained remote since members would have to return to Washington to pass it and the negotiations were not showing any movement. Democrats made clear they intended to stick to their demands and did not appear to be uneasy about any political backlash for blocking money for the agency that also funds airport security, the Coast Guard and disaster relief. “We need change that is dramatic, that is bold, that is meaningful and that is transformational,” Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the House minority leader, said on CBS. “For instance, judicial warrants should be required before ICE agents can storm private property or rip everyday Americans out of their homes.” Many of the Department of Homeland Security’s workers remain on the job but run the risk of missing a paycheck if the funding fight drags on. Mr. Trump is scheduled to deliver the first formal State of the Union address of his second term before Congress next Tuesday. Without some breakthrough, he will make the speech before Congress with one agency without a congressional appropriation for the year, though ICE has a separate pot of money from an earlier measure that can keep it operating.

Credit Credit... Valentin Flauraud/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Indirect talks between American and Iranian officials in Switzerland ended on Tuesday with an agreement on a “set of guiding principles,” according to Iran’s foreign minister, who said both sides had agreed to exchange drafts on a potential deal. The foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, was as positive as he was vague, providing little clarity on what had been discussed or when the next round of discussions might be held. American officials did not immediately comment publicly on the talks, but one U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations, said the two sides had made progress. The official said the Iranians would provide more detailed proposals in the next two weeks to address some of the gaps between the United States and Iran, but did not provide any specifics. Mr. Araghchi told Iranian state television that the talks, which were held in Geneva and lasted about three hours, had been “more constructive” and had made “good progress” compared with a previous round of negotiations in Oman this month. “We now have a clear path ahead, which in my view is positive,” he said. But Mr. Araghchi said a deal was not imminent, as the Middle East remained on edge over the possibility of an American attack should negotiations collapse. Iran has insisted that the talks be strictly limited to its nuclear program, even as U.S. officials have said they would push to curb the range of Iran’s ballistic missiles and its support of militias across the region. Mr. Araghchi did not address those points in his comments to Iranian state television, saying only that the two sides had reached a “general understanding on a set of guiding principles” to continue discussions and to “move toward drafting the text of a possible agreement.” “This does not mean that we can reach an agreement quickly, but at least the path has begun,” he said. Three Iranian officials familiar with the talks said that Iran had indicated a willingness to suspend nuclear enrichment for three to five years — which would cover the duration of Mr. Trump’s presidency — and then join a regional consortium for civilian grade enrichment. Iran would also dilute its stockpile of uranium on its own soil in the presence of international inspectors. In exchange, Iran has demanded that the United States lift financial and banking sanctions and the embargo on its oil sales. The officials, who asked not to be identified to discuss sensitive negotiations, said Iran was also dangling financial incentives and opportunities for investments and trade with the United States, including in Iran’s oil and energy sectors. The negotiations were hosted at the Omani ambassador’s residence by Oman’s foreign minister, Badr Albusaidi, who mediated the previous round of talks. A spokesman for Iran’s foreign ministry said ahead of the talks that Omani officials would shuttle between the two sides. Mr. Albusaidi said on social media after the talks that they had concluded “with good progress towards identifying common goals and relevant technical issues.” “Together we made serious efforts to define a number of guiding principles for a final deal,” he added.",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday released its final report on the midair collision near Ronald Reagan National Airport last year that killed 67 people, as the House announced plans to vote next week on legislation to address some of the institutional failures that investigators said led to the accident. The 419-page document , which brings the board’s intense scrutiny of the accident to a close, did not contain any bombshell revelations, as the board detailed its findings and recommendations late last month. But its presentation of how missed warnings, institutional failures and human errors serve as a detailed and at times devastating account of the episode, which the safety board’s chairwoman, Jennifer Homendy, has said was “100 percent preventable.” The report’s recommendations also serve as a list of action items for aviation safety advocates, who have been pushing for some of the advised changes since long before the crash. But it will be up to Congress and federal agencies whether to implement any of the recommendations. In Congress, the Senate has passed a bipartisan bill to compel the Federal Aviation Administration to conduct safety reviews of airports, and require planes flying through busy airspace to have advanced location tracking technology. That would address two of the key factors that the N.T.S.B. identified in its findings about what caused an Army Black Hawk helicopter to fly into American Airlines Flight 5342 on the night of Jan. 29, without any of the pilots realizing they were on a collision course until barely more than a second before they crashed. But in the House, Representative Sam Graves of Missouri, the Republican chairman of that chamber’s transportation committee, has resisted pressure to advance the legislation. Justin Harclerode, a spokesman for the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said in a statement on Tuesday that the Republican and Democratic leaders of that panel and the one overseeing armed services were “working expeditiously on a comprehensive bill to address the range of issues identified by the N.T.S.B.’s now complete investigation.” He added that the House would soon move forward with its own legislation. Nonetheless, on Tuesday afternoon, following the release of the N.T.S.B. report, House leaders announced plans to put the legislation passed by the Senate to a vote as soon as Monday, with no changes. Two-thirds of the House will have to support the legislation in order for it to pass. During a hearing last week to review the N.T.S.B.’s findings, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Senate committee overseeing transportation, maintained that the bill would “begin to protect the flying public now, which is why the House should pass it and put it on the president’s desk.” Image Family members of those killed in the accident attended a hearing last week that reviewed the N.T.S.B.’s findings on the crash. Credit... Elizabeth Frantz for The New York Times The F.A.A. and the Army have so far not committed to implementing extensive new recommendations the N.T.S.B. approved late last month. Last year, however, the F.A.A. did heed the N.T.S.B.’s recommendations to redirect helicopter traffic around the airport and drastically limit the number of aircraft allowed to pass through the airspace without broadcasting their location to other planes. It implemented the changes just days after the board requested them. “Since Secretary Duffy took office, he and the F.A.A. have taken decisive steps to correct past failures, strengthen accountability and modernize” the national airspace, the F.A.A. said in a statement, referring to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. “Today, we are acting proactively to mitigate risks before they affect the traveling public.” The Army did not respond to a request for comment. The relationship between the F.A.A. and Army has been strained as the aviation safety agency tries to regulate the movements of military aircraft through busy airspace and the military presses to relax the restrictions. In the last week, those tensions were exacerbated by a standoff in El Paso. The F.A.A. temporarily restricted all flights under 18,000 feet there after U.S. Customs and Border Protection, using a high-energy counter-drone laser on loan from the Pentagon, shot down a metallic balloon. The F.A.A. had not yet approved plans to deploy the technology, permission that is required by law. In its final report, the N.T.S.B. issued eight recommendations to the Army. Most of them were directed at training military aviators about the challenges of flying near Reagan National, the limitations of the equipment on board their aircraft, and the collection and assessment of flight safety data. But the bulk of the N.T.S.B.’s new recommendations — 33 of them — were directed at the F.A.A., which board members faulted for poor airport design at Reagan National, ignoring multiple warnings about the potential for collisions. The board also described a culture within the F.A.A. that caused controllers to become accustomed to overwork that sometimes detracted from their ability to closely monitor flights coming dangerously close to one another. On the night of the accident on Jan. 29, 2025, one controller was handling both airplane and helicopter traffic — a double load that the N.T.S.B. found was unnecessary because the control tower at Reagan National had enough staff on hand to avoid it. The board also determined that the controller gave the helicopter pilots too much latitude to manage their own flight through the congested airspace around Reagan National, and never warned the commercial jet pilots to keep an eye out for the Army Black Hawk headed their way. The board also stressed that mandating the use of more advanced location tracking technology — a recommendation it has made as part of multiple aviation accident investigations — could have given the pilots a chance to avoid hitting each other in the contorted airspace around Reagan National, even without the guidance of a controller.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT By the early afternoon on Tuesday, mourners had left around half a dozen bouquets of flowers and a few balloons outside of the Rev. Jesse Jackson’s Tudor-style house on Constance Avenue in the South Shore neighborhood. Next door, Junelle Speller said she had bought her home because she fell in love with the house, but living beside Mr. Jackson was a wonderful bonus. “It was always surreal for us to be living next door to a civil rights icon, someone my husband and I both studied in school here in Chicago,” Mrs. Speller said. Despite Mr. Jackson’s larger-than-life persona and soaring oratory skills, Mrs. Speller soon discovered that in person the civil rights leader “was very grounded, very down to earth, approachable, personable and vibrant.” “He had a deliberate but very inspirational way of speaking,” she said. “You’d be kind of awestruck. But he was at your level, meeting you and sharing those stories, providing motivation for this period of time, for the African American community.” Anita O’Neal, 67, stopped by the Jackson home and showed reporters gathered outside the house a wrinkled photo of herself from 1968. She was 11 years old in the picture, wearing a prim, white outfit for a flight from Chicago to Cape Girardeau, Mo. Sitting in a seat and looking up at her is a young Mr. Jackson, who at the time was a protégé of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Ms. O’Neal said she had come to appreciate the experience only later on in life. “I read about who he was and understood who he was. It was quite an honor for me,” she said. Image Anita O’Neal shows a photo of herself with Jesse Jackson when she was 11 years old. Credit... Nam Y. Huh/Associated Press Ms. O’Neal recalled Mr. Jackson’s quieter side. When he would attend services at St. Sabina Church in the Auburn Gresham neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side, he wouldn’t draw attention to himself, she said. “He wouldn’t come with fanfare,” she said. “He would just walk in, walk down the center aisle, and just go on and sit down.” The pastor, Michael L. Pfleger, would introduce him, she recalled, but Mr. Jackson “didn’t want any recognition. He was there for service.” Joy Jones, 66, said she had come straight to Mr. Jackson’s house after working an overnight shift at a hospital in the Bronzeville neighborhood on the city’s South Side. Still dressed in her purple scrubs, Ms. Jones said she hoped someone would follow in Mr. Jackson’s footsteps just as Mr. Jackson picked up Mr. King’s fight for civil rights after his assassination. “I’m praying that someone will stand up and will continue the movement forward,” Ms. Jones said. “Because it seems this administration is trying to make us take some steps backward, but I really hope that someone — male, female, someone — will stand up and say, ‘We’ve got to keep moving. We’ve got to keep going.’” Among the other Chicagoans who dropped by to pay their respects was Delores Brown, who set down a bouquet of flowers next to the small shrine that had been growing on the Jackson family’s front lawn. He had been a role model, she said, for people in the South Side community where she lived, especially for young Black men. “He’s also been a person that has spoken for us on so many levels when we were not able to speak for ourselves,” she said.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The Rev. Jesse Jackson’s death comes at a moment when Black voters are hugely influential within the Democratic Party and there are more Black senators than ever before — yet the future of Black representation in the House of Representatives is uncertain. The Supreme Court is set to rule in the coming months on a case that will determine the fate of a key provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the federal law that undergirds Southern Black representation in the House. In arguments last fall, the conservative-leaning court seemed skeptical of a key provision of the law, a signature achievement of the civil rights era. Black voters overwhelmingly support the Democratic Party, despite President Trump’s notable gains with them in 2024, and some Democrats and Black faith leaders argue that the country is going backward on civil rights. “We are witnessing right now in real time the kind of attack on voting rights that really does harken back to the darkest days of the civil rights struggle,” Senator Raphael Warnock, a Georgia Democrat and the pastor of the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, said on Tuesday. “I owe it to Rev. Jackson, and we owe it to the next generation, to pass voting rights and ensure that we level the playing field so that every voice can be heard in our democracy.” Some conservatives say that decades of rising political power for Black Americans mean that old legal and policy interventions like the Voting Rights Act are no longer necessary. During oral arguments in the case in October, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said that “this court’s cases, in a variety of contexts, have said that race-based remedies are permissible for a period of time — sometimes for a long period of time, decades in some cases — but that they should not be indefinite, and should have an end point.” Image President Lyndon B. Johnson signing the Voting Rights Act in 1965 as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., center, looked on. Credit... Yoichi Okamoto/LBJ Presidential Library Some Black Republicans, however, have voiced support for the civil rights legislation. “I think the Voting Rights Act is very important — it’s an important part of our history,” Ben Carson, a housing secretary in the first Trump administration, said in an interview. “We should unite around that fact and not let ourselves be divided.” Mr. Carson, who said that he had met Mr. Jackson while still a surgeon and that the civil rights leader had been an early supporter of his books, added: “What’s necessary is that Americans have their voting rights protected, all Americans.” For Democrats, defending the voting rights of Black Americans is also about politics. The influence of Black voters in Democratic presidential primary contests is undeniable: In 2008, 2016 and 2020, Southern states where the primary electorates are dominated by Black voters swung heavily toward the party’s eventual nominees. In those primary races, Black voters in South Carolina and then across the South helped lift Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Joseph R. Biden Jr. to victory, thwarting Mrs. Clinton in her first run, Bernie Sanders and then Mr. Sanders again. Image Joseph R. Biden Jr. meeting supporters after winning the South Carolina Democratic primary race in 2020. His victory there propelled him to the party’s nomination. Credit... Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times In each case, Black voters were pragmatic, said Jaime Harrison, a former chairman of both the Democratic National Committee and the South Carolina Democratic Party, choosing a candidate they believed had the best chance of winning the general election. And now, before the order of states has been set for the 2028 primary contest, a parade of would-be White House hopefuls have made their way to South Carolina. Govs. Gavin Newsom of California and Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, Representative Ro Khanna of California and others have visited the state in recent months with an apparent eye on ingratiating themselves with its largely Black primary electorate. “You’ve seen it election cycle after election cycle,” Mr. Harrison said. “The Black vote has been determinative in the presidential primary. As the first domino falls in South Carolina, it falls the same way across the rest of the South.” Of the 11 Black people ever elected to the Senate , five are serving now: Mr. Booker, Mr. Warnock and Senators Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland and Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, both Democrats. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina is the lone Black Republican senator. Clockwise from top left: Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, Senator Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Senator Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland. The New York Times Ms. Alsobrooks said in an interview on Tuesday that there was “responsibility and pride” in knowing that she is part of the largest group of Black senators to ever serve together. She said the impact went beyond policies debated on the Senate floor. She recalled a day last summer when she arrived after having had her hair braided. “I went to walk onto the Senate floor, when one of the U.S. Capitol Police officers stopped me, and he was thrilled,” she said. “He said, ‘Can I please take a photo with you?’” She added, “He had been in that building for many years and said, ‘Do you know you’re the first person to have ever stepped on the floor of the United States Senate with your hair in braids?’” The provision before the Supreme Court, Section 2, prohibits election or voting practices that discriminate on the basis of race. That guidance has led to the creation of majority-minority districts that are meant to help voters of color elect candidates of their choice. If the court fully struck down the provision, Democrats could lose about a dozen majority-minority districts across the South, according to an analysis by The New York Times . Many of those seats are currently held by Black lawmakers. Even before the Supreme Court ruling arrives, several Republican-led states have already eliminated districts with Black House representatives during the nation’s current gerrymandering battle. In Texas, Representative Marc Veasey, a Democrat, announced he would not run for re-election after he was drawn out of his seat. Representative Al Green, another Democrat, was drawn out of his longtime district and will now run for a different seat in a March primary race . In North Carolina, Representative Don Davis will have a much more difficult re-election fight after the state redrew its maps in October . And in Missouri, a new map threatens the re-election chances of Representative Emanuel Cleaver, a Democrat who has spent 20 years in Congress and was the first Black mayor of Kansas City. This century, the Supreme Court has chipped away at the Voting Rights Act. In 2013, the court struck down another key provision , Section 5, which required states with a history of racial discrimination at the polls to obtain federal approval before changing voting laws. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote in the opinion that “things have changed dramatically” since the law’s adoption decades ago. During oral arguments on the current Voting Rights Act case, Hashim M. Mooppan, a principal deputy solicitor general in the Trump administration, said that many Black members of Congress now hailed from districts that were not majority-minority. “None of these positions is going to lead to there being no Black representation in Congress or anything remotely approaching that,” he said. But civil rights leaders contend that the legal erosion of the Voting Rights Act will hurt Black Americans’ political power. “So here we are, Jesse Jackson dies today, and we have less voting rights protection under the Voting Rights Act than we had on Aug. 6, 1965,” said Bishop William Barber II, a civil-rights leader.

      "content": "Pinned Claire Moses Here’s more on his life. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, America’s most influential Black figure in the years between the civil rights crusades of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the election of Barack Obama, died on Tuesday . He was 84. In a statement, his family said that Mr. Jackson “died peacefully,” but did not give a cause. Mr. Jackson, who was celebrated for his impassioned oratory and populist vision of a “rainbow coalition” of the poor and forgotten, picked up the mantle of Dr. King after his assassination in 1968. He ran for president twice , but he never achieved either the commanding moral stature of Dr. King or the ultimate political triumph attained by Mr. Obama. Tributes flowed in for Mr. Jackson , including from President Trump, who called him “a good man” and a “force of nature,” and former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who described him as “a man of God and of the people.” The Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader, described Mr. Jackson as his mentor. “He was a consequential and transformative leader who changed this nation and the world,” Mr. Sharpton said in a statement.

Credit... Kamil Krzaczynski/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images By the early afternoon on Tuesday, mourners had left around half a dozen bouquets of flowers and a few balloons outside of the Rev. Jesse Jackson’s Tudor-style house on Constance Avenue in the South Shore neighborhood. Next door, Junelle Speller said she had bought her home because she fell in love with the house, but living beside Mr. Jackson was a wonderful bonus. “It was always surreal for us to be living next door to a civil rights icon, someone my husband and I both studied in school here in Chicago,” Mrs. Speller said. Despite Mr. Jackson’s larger-than-life persona and soaring oratory skills, Mrs. Speller soon discovered that in person the civil rights leader “was very grounded, very down to earth, approachable, personable and vibrant.” “He had a deliberate but very inspirational way of speaking,” she said. “You’d be kind of awestruck. But he was at your level, meeting you and sharing those stories, providing motivation for this period of time, for the African American community.” Anita O’Neal, 67, stopped by the Jackson home and showed reporters gathered outside the house a wrinkled photo of herself from 1968. She was 11 years old in the picture, wearing a prim, white outfit for a flight from Chicago to Cape Girardeau, Mo. Sitting in a seat and looking up at her is a young Mr. Jackson, who at the time was a protégé of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Ms. O’Neal said she had come to appreciate the experience only later on in life. “I read about who he was and understood who he was. It was quite an honor for me,” she said. Image Anita O’Neal shows a photo of herself with Jesse Jackson when she was 11 years old. Credit... Nam Y. Huh/Associated Press Ms. O’Neal recalled Mr. Jackson’s quieter side. When he would attend services at St. Sabina Church in the Auburn Gresham neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side, he wouldn’t draw attention to himself, she said. “He wouldn’t come with fanfare,” she said. “He would just walk in, walk down the center aisle, and just go on and sit down.” The pastor, Michael L. Pfleger, would introduce him, she recalled, but Mr. Jackson “didn’t want any recognition. He was there for service.” Joy Jones, 66, said she had come straight to Mr. Jackson’s house after working an overnight shift at a hospital in the Bronzeville neighborhood on the city’s South Side. Still dressed in her purple scrubs, Ms. Jones said she hoped someone would follow in Mr. Jackson’s footsteps just as Mr. Jackson picked up Mr. King’s fight for civil rights after his assassination. “I’m praying that someone will stand up and will continue the movement forward,” Ms. Jones said. “Because it seems this administration is trying to make us take some steps backward, but I really hope that someone — male, female, someone — will stand up and say, ‘We’ve got to keep moving. We’ve got to keep going.’” Among the other Chicagoans who dropped by to pay their respects was Delores Brown, who set down a bouquet of flowers next to the small shrine that had been growing on the Jackson family’s front lawn. He had been a role model, she said, for people in the South Side community where she lived, especially for young Black men. “He’s also been a person that has spoken for us on so many levels when we were not able to speak for ourselves,” she said.

Image Theresa Jackson, left, and her fiancé, Hoyt Zanders, paid their respects to Jesse Jackson outside the Lorraine Motel in Memphis on Tuesday. Credit... Brad J. Vest for The New York Times The museum at the Lorraine Motel was closed, typical for a Tuesday. Yet on a cloudy Memphis day, with a cold wind whipping the flags lowered to half-staff, there were still a few people who came to pay their respects outside. On this day, it was not just about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whose assassination on a balcony at the motel on April 4, 1968, defined the city in American history. For at least a couple of visitors, it was a chance to mourn the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who died at 84 on Tuesday and was among the people who witnessed the murder and sought to carry on Dr. King’s civil rights legacy. “I had to be there,” said Theresa Jackson, 56, who had pulled over Tuesday morning, on her way back to Illinois from Biloxi, Miss. Visiting the motel, which is now home to the National Civil Rights Museum , “gave me chills, just the presence of being there.” Across the South, leaders mourned the death of Mr. Jackson, who was born in South Carolina and crisscrossed the region campaigning for civil rights, championing voter registration and making two unsuccessful bids for the presidency. But in Memphis, where Mr. Jackson returned again and again to the site of Dr. King’s assassination, there was a unique grief over the loss of an elder who had inspired the city’s next generation of Black leaders. “He was a fixture,” Mayor Paul Young said in an interview on Tuesday, recounting how as a young student, he voted for Mr. Jackson in a mock presidential election because “he was somebody I could see myself in, that looked like me.” He met Mr. Jackson at the 2024 Democratic National Convention, Mr. Young recalled, and they had a conversation that was both “personal and meaningful.” “I get to serve as mayor today,” Mr. Young said, “tied to the ground that he broke.” Mr. Jackson embodied the connection between Chicago, where he lived, and Memphis, a familiar stop for many Black Americans traveling north. “He almost was sort of like a son of Memphis in many ways,” said State Representative Justin Pearson, who represents Memphis in the Tennessee General Assembly and received a phone call from Mr. Jackson in 2023 after Mr. Pearson’s colleagues had expelled him from the chamber over a gun control protest. “His connection to our city is obviously deeply rooted in sort of the grief of that loss of Dr. King, but also in this desire and willingness to see our city thrive, to become a better place,” Mr. Pearson added. Mr. Jackson built a partnership with Stax Records , a prominent Memphis institution , spreading his message as a signed, spoken-word recording artist. He spoke at churches and schools, stopped at the occasional barbecue j",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Long before the Rev. Jesse Jackson cemented his legacy as a civil-rights leader in struggles across the country and the world, he was a young boy growing up in Greenville, S.C., in an extremely segregated and poor part of the South that would shape his understanding of race in America. It was a place that Mr. Jackson often invoked in speeches. At the 1988 Democratic National Convention in Atlanta, he described how he was born “in a three-room house, bathroom in the backyard, slop jar by the bed, no hot and cold running water.” He was “born in the slum,” he told the audience, “but the slum was not born in me.” On Tuesday, residents in Greenville reflected on those humble beginnings as they learned of Mr. Jackson’s death at the age of 84 . “He is our son,” said Davida Mathis, a lawyer and activist whose father coached Mr. Jackson in football at Sterling High School. “He was our superstar.” As he grew older, Mr. Jackson turned into a studious, strong and extremely confident “super boy,” neighbors said, someone who ignored coaches’ drawn-up plays as quarterback, who ran errands for neighbors on his bike, and who wrote in yearbooks that he would one day be president — never mind that in the 1950s, it was illegal for him to even sit in the front of a bus. Greenville was also the place that kick-started his involvement in civil rights. In the summer of 1960, when Mr. Jackson was not yet 20 years old, he helped lead a march with seven other Black students at the Greenville public library that had denied him access. And in 2002, when he learned that Greenville County did not acknowledge Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a paid holiday, he flew there every few weeks to petition the local government to begin honoring it. When that didn’t work, he helped organize a march. And after that, he and his allies backed Republican primary candidates who promised to vote for the holiday. Those candidates won, and the county now closes for business on that day. “He’s one of ours who’s done good, and I think that gets overlooked, especially in conversations about the South and activism,” said Avery Allen, a Greenville native who knew Mr. Jackson her entire life. Ken Gibson, a member of the Greenville City Council who knew Mr. Jackson well, described him on Tuesday as “a phenomenal individual.” “He had the most fantastic presence, and he just filled a room,” said Mr. Gibson, whose parents were civil-rights activists with the N.A.A.C.P. in the early 1960s. Still, residents say that Greenville’s celebration of Mr. Jackson feels more muted than in other cities in the South that have birthed titans of the Civil Rights era. In Birmingham, Ala., for example, the city’s airport is named after Fred Shuttlesworth, a Black leader who survived beatings and bombings. At North Carolina A&T University — which Mr. Jackson attended — there is a monument dedicated to the four students who sat down at the segregated lunch counter of the Woolworth’s store.

Nick Madigan But in Greenville, S.C., there is no major street, historical marker or monument dedicated to Mr. Jackson, residents noted. Several years ago, there was an effort to preserve his childhood home on Haynie Street as a historical site. But the project fizzled after the councilwoman who led the effort died in 2016. “The fact that Jesse Jackson brings recognition to Greenville and to South Carolina, you would think that they would take advantage of that legacy to use it for tourism,” said Abel A. Bartley, a professor of African American and civil rights history at Clemson University. “The things he did to move our country and our nation forward on civil rights deserves some kind of recognition. And his hometown in particular should lead the way.” Some in Greenville were more interested on Tuesday in reminiscing about quieter, more intimate memories. They remembered Mr. Jackson’s trips back home when he was already an established political figure, how he would ask to go to S & S Cafeteria on Pleasantburg Drive to order his favorite banana cream pie. And they recalled the rhyme and riddle game he would play with his mother, Helen Burns, even in the months before her death in 2015. He would stand by her bedside at the hospital, say a random phrase like “big son went down to the river,” and she would respond with a sentence that rhymed and matched thematically. Freddie Jean Clinkscales, 84, who went to high school with Mr. Jackson, looked up at the house on Haynie Street on Tuesday. She thought of the young man who “was always trying to help everybody,” she said, and who decades later fought to make sure she could sit wherever she wanted to. It had felt so belittling in her youth to step onto an empty bus and be forced to hold herself steady with a pole in the back. If it had not been for people like Mr. Jackson, she said, “we’d still be hanging onto that pole.” Eduardo Medina is a Times reporter covering the South.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Over the past year, the Trump administration has engaged in unconventional diplomacy, gunboat diplomacy and, in the most sensitive crises, diplomacy without diplomats. On Tuesday, the administration tried all three tactics at once. In Geneva, President Trump’s most trusted envoys — his real estate friend Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner — engaged the Iranians in the morning, then the Russians and the Ukrainians in the afternoon. It was a stark example of Mr. Trump’s conviction that the State Department and the National Security Council, the two institutions that have coordinated negotiations over global crises for nearly 80 years, are best left on the sidelines. And so, the Witkoff-Kushner duo has been at the center of recent efforts to end a nuclear crisis in Iran that has stretched over two decades, and a war in Ukraine that is days away from entering its fifth year. By all accounts, Mr. Trump has confidence in their approach, reinforced by their negotiations last year to win a cease-fire in Gaza and the return of all Israeli hostages held by Hamas. And countries like Russia, Turkey and the Gulf Arab states have welcomed the arrival of the two men, with their transactional approach born of New York property negotiations, especially given the greater flexibility offered by Mr. Witkoff and Mr. Kushner. They talk the language of deal makers, and do not spend much time lecturing on human rights or democracy building. And not infrequently, their interlocutors on diplomatic issues are closely linked to the business deals that the Trump and Witkoff families are negotiating. “Some countries really welcome this informal structure at the Trump White House,” said Asli Aydintasbas, a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. But, she added, “I have not seen anyone hugely impressed with the diplomatic skills of the current team.” One person close to the Kremlin said that Russian officials appreciated Mr. Witkoff’s warmth and enthusiasm for the negotiations, even as they sometimes doubted his reliability as a messenger. But he was clearly new to the issues dividing Washington and Moscow, and at first brought no other American experts into his negotiations. More recently, the Russians have been happy to have Mr. Kushner’s involvement, the person said, because of his more organized and structured approach. Some Russians have taken to calling the duo “Witkoff and Zyatkoff,” because “zyat” is Russian for son-in-law. The Iranians also have a nickname for Mr. Kushner, using the Persian word for son-in-law: Damad Trump, again defining Mr. Kushner’s influence by virtue of his marriage to the president’s daughter, Ivanka. Iranian media have dedicated coverage and columns to Mr. Kushner’s participation. Ahmad Zeidabadi, a prominent political analyst and columnist, wrote in Asr Iran newspaper that Mr. Kushner’s participation in talks was something “positive.” “He represents the pragmatic and softer side of Trump,” he said. Mr. Kushner, in an interview last October , said that his and Mr. Witkoff’s approach to diplomacy relied on being “deal guys” who “have to understand people.” Mr. Witkoff was known in real estate circles for major transactions, including buying the Woolworth Building, once New York’s tallest skyscraper, in 1998. Mr. Kushner followed his father, the real estate developer Charles Kushner, into the business and later expanded into private equity. Mr. Kushner holds no official government title, and gets no government salary, while Mr. Witkoff is a U.S. “special envoy.” In Mr. Trump’s first term, Mr. Kushner spearheaded the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab countries — though his hopes of bringing Saudi Arabia aboard have not yet come to fruition. Last year, his efforts negotiating the cease-fire in Gaza drew praise even from some Democrats, for pushing closer to ending a war that President Joseph R. Biden Jr. could not. Supporters of the administration see Mr. Witkoff and Mr. Kushner as ideal negotiators in part because their personal wealth, they say, makes them more resistant to corrupting influences. But both men face questions over apparent conflicts of interest. Mr. Witkoff’s son Zach is the chief executive of World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s cryptocurrency company. An investment firm tied to the United Arab Emirates purchased nearly half the company last year for $500 million. Mr. Kushner raised several billion dollars before Mr. Trump’s second term from overseas investors, including government wealth funds in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, countries he had worked with when he served as a senior White House adviser during Mr. Trump’s first term. Yet as they engage with Mr. Witkoff and Mr. Kushner, the Russians and the Iranians share a strategy: delay. At the Munich Security Conference last weekend, several participants on the edges of the negotiations over Ukraine, which Russia invaded four years ago next Tuesday, said repeatedly that Russia had every reason to engage in the negotiations and little compelling reason to sign an agreement. President Vladimir V. Putin believes he is winning, military and intelligence officials from several Western countries said in recent days. And he is convinced that even if it takes 18 months to two years to complete his hold on the Donbas region, each day of fighting and each night of Russian missiles and drones raining down on energy infrastructure and apartment buildings secure him more leverage. For the Iranians, delay is the regime’s last strategy for survival. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was in Slovakia and Hungary early this week but is not participating in either of the Geneva negotiations, made the case for pessimism. “It’s going to be hard,” he told reporters. “It’s been very difficult for anyone to do real deals with Iran, because we’re dealing with radical Shia clerics who are making theological decisions, not geopolitical ones.” But the commonalities end there. In the Iranian case, Mr. Trump is backing up his diplomacy with a threat of fairly imminent military action if there is no progress — maybe in days, perhaps in weeks. In the Russia-Ukraine case, he has slowed down the military pressure, halting the direct provision of arms to Ukraine that took place — with strong congressional support — in the Biden years. The president has also cracked down on the Russian “shadow fleet” selling oil, exacerbating Mr. Putin’s deepening economic troubles, even while the Trump administration floats ideas about U.S. investment in Russia if a deal, almost any deal, can be announced. Given those dynamics, some analysts predicted that Mr. Putin could still make a deal to stop the fighting in Ukraine, especially if he secured a far-reaching rapprochement with the United States and a withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from the rest of the Donbas. The negotiations with Iran are overshadowed by the size of the U.S. naval force — a “great armada” in Mr. Trump’s telling — that is being assembled in the Red Sea, clearly positioned to strike if the president so decides. But the Iranians are hardly de-escalating. They have temporarily closed the Strait of Hormuz because of Iranian live fire exercises, a not-so-gentle reminder of the country’s ability to throw energy markets into chaos. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, did not contribute much to the spirit of finding a nonmilitary solution when he was asked about the presence of one U.S. carrier group and the arrival in a week or so of a second — a huge massing of firepower. “An aircraft carrier is a dangerous machine, but even more dangerous than that is the weapon capable of sending it to the bottom of the sea,” he said as he commemorated the 1978 uprising that toppled the pro-American Shah of Iran. (The Shah’s son, Reza Pahlavi, was in Munich over the weekend, at one of many large protests around the world that echoed his calls for th",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The U.S. Capitol Police arrested an 18-year-old man on Tuesday afternoon after he exited a vehicle and ran toward the Capitol building with a loaded shotgun. No one was hurt and there was no further threat to the area, the agency said. The episode occurred just after noon, when the armed man got out of a white Mercedes S.U.V. parked on Maryland Avenue and began running toward the Capitol, Chief Michael G. Sullivan of the Capitol Police told reporters. Capitol Police officers confronted the man at the base of a staircase walkway near the West Front of the building, drew their firearms and ordered him to drop his weapon. The man “immediately complied” and lay on the ground, where he was taken into custody, Mr. Sullivan said. The man was wearing a tactical vest and gloves and carrying additional ammunition rounds. A Kevlar helmet and a gas mask were also found in his vehicle, Mr. Sullivan said. Investigators were still working to determine the man’s motive. Capitol Police temporarily closed a section of Maryland Avenue near the Garfield Monument, and the authorities have footage of the man but were asking members of the public who may have taken additional cellphone footage to send it in, Mr. Sullivan said. Capitol Police identified the man as Carter Camacho of Smyrna, Ga., and said in a statement that he was arrested for unlawful activities, carrying a rifle without a license, having an unregistered firearm and having unregistered ammunition. He was not previously known to Capitol Police, and there did not appear to be any other suspects involved, the agency said. Congress was not in session this week, but the episode comes at a time when lawmakers have faced escalating threats. A man attacked Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota during a town hall event in Minneapolis less than a month ago, and lawmakers had already been grappling with intense fears about their personal safety after the assassination of the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk on a college campus. Capitol Police said it had investigated nearly 15,000 “concerning statements, behaviors, and communications directed against members of Congress, their families, staff, and the Capitol complex” in 2025, roughly a 58 percent increase over 2024 . Mr. Sullivan, who commended the officers who responded on Tuesday for their “brave service,” said that Capitol Police had held an active shooter exercise a few months ago “virtually in the same spot” where the man was confronted. “We do those active shooter exercises every single month,” he said, “and that’s why we do it.” Anushka Patil is a Times reporter covering breaking and developing news around the world.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The United States indicted the captain of an oil tanker that led American forces on a weekslong chase across the Atlantic Ocean after being stopped on its way to Venezuela, the first time President Trump’s crackdown on Venezuelan oil has resulted in criminal charges. The captain, Avtandil Kalandadze, was charged with two federal crimes, according to the Feb. 12 indictment, which has not previously been reported. The first count accused Mr. Kalandadze of falsely flying the flag of Guyana on the tanker — the ship was not registered in that country — in an attempt to evade being seized by the U.S. Coast Guard on Dec. 20. The second accuses Mr. Kalandadze of failing to obey an order from the Coast Guard to stop the tanker and allow U.S. forces to board it. Instead, the ship, then known as Bella 1, which had been sailing in the Caribbean Sea toward Venezuela, turned back into the Atlantic, chased by U.S. forces. Along the way, the ship changed its name to Marinera and claimed Russian protection. Its crew painted a Russian flag on the tanker’s side, and it was registered in Russia’s official ship database . The Russian government used diplomatic channels to request that the United States stop chasing the tanker. But U.S. forces boarded and seized the ship on Jan. 7, near the United Kingdom, detaining Mr. Kalandadze and the rest of the crew. The seizure of the ship was part of Mr. Trump’s attempt to take control of Venezuela’s multi-billion-dollar oil industry. So far, the United States has boarded eight other vessels involved in the Venezuelan oil trade. The ships are part of a so-called ghost fleet transporting oil from Venezuela, Iran or Russia around the globe in violation of sanctions placed by the United States and other countries. U.S. authorities had obtained a seizure warrant for the Bella 1 based on its history of transporting Iranian oil for groups linked to terrorism. After the ship was seized, Mr. Kalandadze’s wife, Natia Dzadzama, initiated an unsuccessful legal challenge in the United Kingdom, seeking a judicial review of her husband’s detention, according to local media reports. Aamer Anwar, a lawyer for Ms. Dzadzama, said in a statement on Tuesday that “the U.S. has once again shown a total disregard for the rule of law and international obligations with its closest ally, the U.K.” The White House and the Justice Department did not immediately reply to requests for comment. The BBC reported last month that the United States planned to charge another member of the crew but had released the remaining 26 crew members. Note: The International Maritime Organization issues an IMO number, a permanent identification number, that remains associated with a vessel throughout its lifetime unlike a ship’s name, which can change frequently. The ship in this article is 9230880, known as Marinera, or previously as Bella 1.

      "content": "Pinned Claire Moses Here’s more on his life. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, America’s most influential Black figure in the years between the civil rights crusades of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the election of Barack Obama, died on Tuesday . He was 84. In a statement, his family said that Mr. Jackson “died peacefully,” but did not give a cause. Mr. Jackson, who was celebrated for his impassioned oratory and populist vision of a “rainbow coalition” of the poor and forgotten, picked up the mantle of Dr. King after his assassination in 1968. He ran for president twice , but he never achieved either the commanding moral stature of Dr. King or the ultimate political triumph attained by Mr. Obama. Tributes flowed in for Mr. Jackson , including from President Trump, who called him “a good man” and a “force of nature,” and former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who described him as “a man of God and of the people.” The Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader, described Mr. Jackson as his mentor. “He was a consequential and transformative leader who changed this nation and the world,” Mr. Sharpton said in a statement.

Credit... Kamil Krzaczynski/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images By the early afternoon on Tuesday, mourners had left around half a dozen bouquets of flowers and a few balloons outside of the Rev. Jesse Jackson’s Tudor-style house on Constance Avenue in the South Shore neighborhood. Next door, Junelle Speller said she had bought her home because she fell in love with the house, but living beside Mr. Jackson was a wonderful bonus. “It was always surreal for us to be living next door to a civil rights icon, someone my husband and I both studied in school here in Chicago,” Mrs. Speller said. Despite Mr. Jackson’s larger-than-life persona and soaring oratory skills, Mrs. Speller soon discovered that in person the civil rights leader “was very grounded, very down to earth, approachable, personable and vibrant.” “He had a deliberate but very inspirational way of speaking,” she said. “You’d be kind of awestruck. But he was at your level, meeting you and sharing those stories, providing motivation for this period of time, for the African American community.” Anita O’Neal, 67, stopped by the Jackson home and showed reporters gathered outside the house a wrinkled photo of herself from 1968. She was 11 years old in the picture, wearing a prim, white outfit for a flight from Chicago to Cape Girardeau, Mo. Sitting in a seat and looking up at her is a young Mr. Jackson, who at the time was a protégé of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Ms. O’Neal said she had come to appreciate the experience only later on in life. “I read about who he was and understood who he was. It was quite an honor for me,” she said. Image Anita O’Neal shows a photo of herself with Jesse Jackson when she was 11 years old. Credit... Nam Y. Huh/Associated Press Ms. O’Neal recalled Mr. Jackson’s quieter side. When he would attend services at St. Sabina Church in the Auburn Gresham neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side, he wouldn’t draw attention to himself, she said. “He wouldn’t come with fanfare,” she said. “He would just walk in, walk down the center aisle, and just go on and sit down.” The pastor, Michael L. Pfleger, would introduce him, she recalled, but Mr. Jackson “didn’t want any recognition. He was there for service.” Joy Jones, 66, said she had come straight to Mr. Jackson’s house after working an overnight shift at a hospital in the Bronzeville neighborhood on the city’s South Side. Still dressed in her purple scrubs, Ms. Jones said she hoped someone would follow in Mr. Jackson’s footsteps just as Mr. Jackson picked up Mr. King’s fight for civil rights after his assassination. “I’m praying that someone will stand up and will continue the movement forward,” Ms. Jones said. “Because it seems this administration is trying to make us take some steps backward, but I really hope that someone — male, female, someone — will stand up and say, ‘We’ve got to keep moving. We’ve got to keep going.’” Among the other Chicagoans who dropped by to pay their respects was Delores Brown, who set down a bouquet of flowers next to the small shrine that had been growing on the Jackson family’s front lawn. He had been a role model, she said, for people in the South Side community where she lived, especially for young Black men. “He’s also been a person that has spoken for us on so many levels when we were not able to speak for ourselves,” she said.

Vest for The New York Times The museum at the Lorraine Motel was closed, typical for a Tuesday. Yet on a cloudy Memphis day, with a cold wind whipping the flags lowered to half-staff, there were still a few people who came to pay their respects outside. On this day, it was not just about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whose assassination on a balcony at the motel on April 4, 1968, defined the city in American history. For at least a couple of visitors, it was a chance to mourn the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who died at 84 on Tuesday and was among the people who witnessed the murder and sought to carry on Dr. King’s civil rights legacy. “I had to be there,” said Theresa Jackson, 56, who had pulled over Tuesday morning, on her way back to Illinois from Biloxi, Miss. Visiting the motel, which is now home to the National Civil Rights Museum , “gave me chills, just the presence of being there.” Across the South, leaders mourned the death of Mr. Jackson, who was born in South Carolina and crisscrossed the region campaigning for civil rights, championing voter registration and making two unsuccessful bids for the presidency. But in Memphis, where Mr. Jackson returned again and again to the site of Dr. King’s assassination, there was a unique grief over the loss of an elder who had inspired the city’s next generation of Black leaders. “He was a fixture,” Mayor Paul Young said in an interview on Tuesday, recounting how as a young student, he voted for Mr. Jackson in a mock presidential election because “he was somebody I could see myself in, that looked like me.” He met Mr. Jackson at the 2024 Democratic National Convention, Mr. Young recalled, and they had a conversation that was both “personal and meaningful.” “I get to serve as mayor today,” Mr. Young said, “tied to the ground that he broke.” Mr. Jackson embodied the connection between Chicago, where he lived, and Memphis, a familiar stop for many Black Americans traveling north. “He almost was sort of like a son of Memphis in many ways,” said State Representative Justin Pearson, who represents Memphis in the Tennessee General Assembly and received a phone call from Mr. Jackson in 2023 after Mr. Pearson’s colleagues had expelled him from the chamber over a gun control protest. “His connection to our city is obviously deeply rooted in sort of the grief of that loss of Dr. King, but also in this desire and willingness to see our city thrive, to become a better place,” Mr. Pearson added. Mr. Jackson built a partnership with Stax Records , a prominent Memphis institution , spreading his message as a signed, spoken-word recording artist. He spoke at churches and schools, stopped at the occasional barbecue j",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Representative Randy Fine, Republican of Florida, on Tuesday faced a barrage of calls for his resignation from Democrats — and silence from Republican leaders — after making an Islamophobic statement suggesting he prefers dogs to Muslims. Mr. Fine, a Jewish first-term congressman who was known in the Florida Legislature as “The Hebrew Hammer” and often makes Islamophobic remarks on social media, made the statement in question on Sunday in response to a post from a Palestinian activist based in New York City. Nerdeen Kiswani, a Palestinian Muslim New Yorker and organizer, said in a social media post that dung-filled snowdrifts in the city proved that dogs should not have a place in society as indoor pets because, she wrote, “like we’ve said all along, they are unclean.” Mr. Fine responded: “If they force us to choose, the choice between dogs and Muslims is not a difficult one.” The comment prompted immediate and unequivocal condemnation from Democrats. Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said that Mr. Fine “is a disgrace to the United States Congress. He is an Islamophobic, disgusting and unrepentant bigot.” Mr. Jeffries added that it was “unacceptable that Mike Johnson and House Republicans continue to remain silent,” referring to the speaker. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, the reigning Democratic king of trolling Republicans online, wrote bluntly, “Resign now, you racist slob.” Many House Democrats called for Mr. Fine to be stripped of his committee assignments. But Mr. Johnson remained silent, and Mr. Fine doubled down in response to the backlash. “My post was in response to a major Muslim leader saying dogs should be forbidden from New York City because to some Muslims, it bothers them,” Mr. Fine said in an appearance on Newsmax. “If they’re going to make us choose between our dogs and them going home, the choice is easy.” One of the few conservatives who criticized Mr. Fine publicly was Megyn Kelly, the podcast host, who wrote in an online post that “instead of attacking the person or the policy, you went full bigot.” On social media, Ms. Kiswani called Mr. Fine a “rabid Zionist” who used her words “as an excuse to post genocidal rhetoric against Muslims.” In a follow-up email to The New York Times, Ms. Kiswani said that she had intended her words to land as a “mild, satirical” post, and viewed Mr. Fine’s response as reflective of a political climate in which “anti-Palestinian and anti-Muslim bigotry is normalized and hostility toward our communities is more easily justified.” She said her post was misinterpreted and used as “grounds for days of attacks, threats and widespread misinformation, including inaccurate claims that I am part of Mayor Mamdani’s administration.” Mr. Fine has referred to both Muslim women in Congress as “terrorists.” In a post in May, he addressed Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, who had accused the Israeli government of starving Gazans, saying she should “tell your fellow Muslim terrorists to release the hostages and surrender. Until then, #StarveAway.” In July, Mr. Fine called Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, a “terrorist” after she appeared to refer to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel as a war criminal. “I’m sure it is difficult to see us welcome the killer of so many of your fellow Muslim terrorists,” he wrote online, referring to Ms. Omar. “The only shame is that you serve in Congress.” At the time, House Democratic leaders condemned his comment. Mr. Johnson never did. Annie Karni is a congressional correspondent for The Times.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The White House on Tuesday rejected the latest offer from Democratic lawmakers on proposed new constraints on federal immigration officers, the latest sign that there would not be a quick resolution of the stalemate that has left the Department of Homeland Security without funding since Saturday. A White House official who provided a statement on the condition of anonymity to describe private negotiations said the two parties were still far apart, adding that President Trump’s team remained interested in continuing good-faith talks to resolve the impasse. In response, aides for the Democratic leaders in Congress said that Republicans had largely ignored the guardrails the public was demanding, and urged them to start negotiating in good faith as they said their side had been doing. Both White House officials and Democrats on Capitol Hill have kept largely confidential the specifics of their offers to end the standoff that allowed funding for the agency to lapse as of 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The outlines of the Democratic demands, however, are well known: limits on masked police, an end to random sweeps, new requirements for judicial warrants, putting “sensitive locations” such as churches, schools, hospitals and polling places off limits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement among them. The offer was given to the White House Monday evening but brushed aside by the White House less than 24 hours later. “These are common sense,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said Sunday on CNN about the Democratic proposals. “Police departments across America use them. We have a rogue agency. Why don’t we rein them in? That’s what the American people are asking Republicans.” Democrats have portrayed the earlier White House counteroffer to Democrats, which has not been made public, as “nonserious.” People familiar with the talks have said that the White House has not been responsive to many of the Democratic demands for limits on federal immigration agents, and has pushed for new authority of its own, including increased penalties for those who dox officers. Some Republicans have also said that they want an end to local and state policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, sometimes called sanctuary city policies, in exchange for concessions. “When it comes to masks, I don’t know of another law enforcement agency in the country that has an 8,000-percent increase in threats,” Tom Homan, President Trump’s border czar, said Sunday on CBS News’s “Face the Nation.” “Just yesterday, the director of ICE, his wife was filmed walking to work. His home address has been doxed. His kids have been doxed and filmed.” With Congress on a weeklong recess and lawmakers scattered around the world and the nation, chances for approval of a funding agreement this week remained remote since members would have to return to Washington to pass it and the negotiations were not showing any movement. Democrats made clear they intended to stick to their demands and did not appear to be uneasy about any political backlash for blocking money for the agency that also funds airport security, the Coast Guard and disaster relief. “We need change that is dramatic, that is bold, that is meaningful and that is transformational,” Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the House minority leader, said on CBS. “For instance, judicial warrants should be required before ICE agents can storm private property or rip everyday Americans out of their homes.” Many of the Department of Homeland Security’s workers remain on the job but run the risk of missing a paycheck if the funding fight drags on. Mr. Trump is scheduled to deliver the first formal State of the Union address of his second term before Congress next Tuesday. Without some breakthrough, he will make the speech before Congress with one agency without a congressional appropriation for the year, though ICE has a separate pot of money from an earlier measure that can keep it operating.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT For two decades, few corners of global finance were lonelier than the market for Japanese government bonds. Under the Bank of Japan’s longstanding regime of keeping borrowing costs pinned at zero, yields on the securities, known as J.G.B.s, largely flatlined. Over the years, the few contrarian investors willing to bet that yields might eventually rise were burned so badly that the trade was named the “widow-maker.” In the world’s second-largest government bond market, entire days would pass without a single benchmark bond changing hands. Those days are gone. Last month, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s vow to cut taxes sparked anxiety over Tokyo’s ability to service its staggering $9 trillion debt. Yields on the 30-year government bond surged more than a quarter percentage point in a single session, an enormous move in a market where daily changes are typically measured only in hundredths of a point. The volatility was so profound that Scott Bessent, the U.S. Treasury secretary, called his counterparts in Tokyo seeking reassurances to help steady global markets rattled by the moves. Yields, a benchmark for borrowing costs, jumped again last week after Ms. Takaichi’s party won in a landslide election, which investors viewed as a mandate for her high-spending agenda. For the broader Japanese economy, the spike signals a potentially grim slide. If yields continue their ascent, some economists and investors warn that Japan risks falling into a “debt trap” — a vicious cycle in which rising interest costs consume so much of the national budget that the government must borrow even more just to pay the interest. But for J.G.B.s and their veteran traders, the recent movements have generated a return to a level of fervor not seen in decades. After a prolonged professional hibernation, a rare class of traders and strategists — most now in their 60s or older — are finding themselves back in the limelight as global investment firms seek to tap their experience in navigating an environment of actual, moving interest rates. “It’s becoming a ‘battlefield’ again,” said Hiroyuki Kubota, 67, who dealt Japanese government bonds 40 years ago and has since written several books on the securities. “It’s just like the old days.” Image Hiroyuki Kubota, a veteran of the Japanese government bond market going back decades, said the recent fluctuations in yields reminded him of “the old days.” Credit... Kentaro Takahashi for The New York Times Mr. Kubota began dealing the bonds in 1986, just after a series of reforms meaningfully opened Japan’s government debt markets to global investors. At the time, Nomura Securities, the king of Japan’s bubble-era finance, was hosting boozy, dayslong annual cherry blossom seminars in Kyoto to pitch government bonds to overseas central bankers. The market was booming. In the 1980s and 1990s, yields shifted rapidly alongside fluctuations in Japan’s overall economy. Yields on 10-year bonds doubled from 4 percent in 1989 to 8 percent in 1990, before falling back to 5 percent by 1992. Investors rushed to profit from the swings. After J.G.B. futures — contracts to buy or sell bonds at a later date — were introduced in 1985, they quickly became the world’s most heavily traded bond futures. “It was a party,” said Hiromi Yamaji, 70, chief executive of the Japan Exchange Group, recalling the annual Kyoto gatherings of the 1980s. Before assuming his current post at the operator of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Mr. Yamaji spent 36 years at Nomura. J.G.B.s “were a very lucrative product,” he said. “Everybody was trading them a lot.” At the time, traders were being wooed by the likes of Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers, which were expanding their presence in Tokyo. Top-tier strategists could command compensation packages in the millions of dollars as American firms sought to poach talent from traditional Japanese banks. Mr. Kubota, the former J.G.B. dealer, started a website in the late 1990s featuring a chat room that he said had attracted market movers and officials from Japan’s Ministry of Finance. He hosted annual parties on a traditional Japanese houseboat, where the elite of the bond world would talk shop while cruising the Sumida River in central Tokyo. Recent swings in yields “may have been a shock to those who only knew the last 20 years,” Mr. Kubota said. “But to those who know the old days, they aren’t strange at all.” Image In the years since Mr. Kubota started dealing government bonds in the 1980s, he has become one of Japan’s best-known bond watchers and has written several books on the subject. Credit... via Hiroyuki Kubota Paralysis began to set in for Japanese government bonds around the turn of the century. After the bursting of the Japanese asset bubble and the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the Bank of Japan in 1999 became the first major central bank in recent memory to lower interest rates to zero. As the central bank began buying bonds to force rates down, the 10-year yield hit a record low of less than 0.5 percent in 2003. For two decades, as policymakers kept rates near zero to combat persistent deflation, yields hardly budged. In 2016, they fell below zero, meaning investors were basically paying to hold the bonds. “For many, many years, it was a very difficult market,” the Japan Exchange Group’s Mr. Yamaji said. “Nobody had any interest in trading.” With average daily trading volumes tanking, Japan’s local banks, once the most aggressive traders of government bonds, began to close their trading operations. International groups scaled back as well. Many veterans left high-paying foreign firms like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley. They either “semiretired” or were pushed into less glamorous roles, such as research, at domestic firms, said Yoshiki Kumazawa, a director at Morgan McKinley, a recruitment firm in Tokyo. “We call it ‘juniorization,’” said Mr. Kumazawa, who compared it to shipping a baseball player who once starred for the New York Yankees off to a Japanese team. Mr. Yamaji tried to revive the market throughout the 2010s by introducing new trading methods for the bonds, but the stagnation persisted until 2024. That was when a burst of postpandemic inflation led the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates for the first time in 17 years . This prompted a rise in bond yields. Image Hiromi Yamaji, the chief executive of the group that runs the Tokyo Stock Exchange, remembers when trading Japanese government bonds “was a party.” Credit... Kentaro Takahashi for The New York Times Those yields then spiked higher on Jan. 19, when Ms. Takaichi endorsed a tax-suspension measure estimated to cost more than $30 billion annually. The next day, Japan’s 40-year bond yield broke above 4 percent for the first time since 2007. Some see the surge as an alarming sign that Japan will struggle to finance its debt. Kyle Bass, founder of Hayman Capital Management, a Dallas-based hedge fund, was known in the 2010s for his high-conviction bet that Japanese bond yields would eventually skyrocket as the government’s debt load reached a breaking point, a wager widely dismissed as the ultimate “widow-maker.” He acknowledges that the position did not pay off at the time. Now, with yields rising and Japan’s total debt having risen to a record $8.77 trillion last year, his thesis is becoming harder to dismiss. “The question is: How do they hold it all together?” Mr. Bass said. Borrowing costs are rising in a number of the world’s largest economies. Japan, however, “is about 10 years ahead of everyone in its financial position,” he said. “I’m afraid of the situation they’re in.” For others, the commotion is an opportunity. Average daily trading volumes of J.G.B. futures have surged in recent years, and the number of outstanding positions in the market has reached record highs, according to Mr. Yamaji. Global hedge funds have snapped up top local talent, according to Mr. Kumazawa. Mr. Kubota, the former J.G.B. dealer and well-kn",

The order, in a lawsuit filed by a Chicago man in 2023, was dripping with skepticism at the claims that the chain was misleading consumers about its boneless wings. Judge John J. Tharp Jr., of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, dismissed the claim by Aimen Halim, saying it “has no meat on its bones.” “Despite his best efforts, Halim did not ‘drum’ up enough factual allegations to state a claim,” Judge Tharp said in his ruling. Buffalo Wild Wings did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for Mr. Halim also did not respond to a request for comment. According to the complaint, Mr. Halim bought boneless wings from Buffalo Wild Wings in Mount Prospect, Ill., in January 2023. Mr. Halim thought he was buying chicken wings that had been deboned, but he soon discovered they were not. Mr. Halim sued Buffalo Wild Wings, saying the chain deceives its customers by labeling its products as “boneless wings,” when the chain instead uses breast meat, which is cheaper. According to the judge’s order, Mr. Halim claimed that had he known the product was not actually deboned chicken wings, he would have paid less or not bought it at all. Buffalo Wild Wings disputed Mr. Halim’s claims, saying that context clues make clear the nuggets cannot be made of wing meat, and that “wing” refers to the style of cooking, not a chicken’s body part. In his order, the judge sided with Buffalo Wild Wings, saying a reasonable consumer would not think that boneless wings were made of wing meat. Judge Tharp noted that cauliflower wings are also sold under the wing section of the restaurant’s menu and as an alternative to traditional wings. “If Halim is right, reasonable consumers should think that cauliflower wings are made (at least in part) from wing meat,” he said. “They don’t, though.” Judge Tharp also said that the menu offered boneless wings at a cheaper price than traditional wings — an indication that the item is not, in fact, deboned. Mr. Halim can amend his claim to try to prove he suffered “economic injury,” but it’s unlikely to be persuasive, Judge Tharp said. He has until March 20 to file an amended complaint. This is not the first time that boneless chicken wings have caused legal action and other drama. The Ohio Supreme Court ruled in July 2024 that a man who ordered boneless wings should have expected the possibility of bones, denying him a jury trial after he suffered serious medical complications from a bone fragment. In 2020, a man in Lincoln, Neb., delivered a passionate plea to his City Council to remove the name boneless wings from menus in the city. And on Reddit, there are hundreds of comments debating the legitimacy of “boneless wings” as a true product, with some carefully explaining how they are different from chicken nuggets. Recipes explaining how to make boneless wings call for a variety of ingredients, but typically begin with a boneless chicken breast.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The U.S. government outlined tens of billions of dollars in planned Japanese investments in the United States as part of a trade agreement struck last year, marking the start of a massive pledge that has faced domestic frictions and financing hurdles. In a statement late Tuesday, the U.S. commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said Japan would provide capital for three projects: a natural gas plant in Ohio, a crude oil export facility along the U.S. Gulf Coast and a synthetic diamond manufacturing site in Georgia. The projects represent a $36 billion commitment and are expected to generate thousands of jobs, Mr. Lutnick said. The energy and manufacturing projects are the first phase of funding under a trade framework agreed in July, under which Tokyo pledged $550 billion in funding to U.S.-based projects. In exchange, the Trump administration agreed to impose a 15 percent blanket tariff on Japanese exports — a reprieve from the more aggressive duties it had threatened. For months, U.S. officials have pressured their Japanese counterparts to move forward with concrete investment plans. For members of the Trump administration, especially Mr. Lutnick, the goal was to maintain momentum after President Trump’s visit to Japan in October. For their part, Japanese officials were eager to show progress before Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s scheduled visit to the United States in March. In an election last week, her party won in a landslide , and Mr. Trump congratulated the prime minister, wishing her success in her “conservative, peace-through-strength agenda.” Around the time of Ms. Takaichi’s visit to the United States, Japanese officials are considering making several additional investment announcements, according to two people familiar with the plans. Japan is aiming to stay out of Mr. Trump’s cross hairs as the country is already feeling the economic ramifications of a prolonged diplomatic dispute with China, Japan’s largest trading partner. Last month, Mr. Trump threatened to raise tariffs on South Korea, saying the country was not moving fast enough to ratify its trade deal with the United States. Japan “understood there needed to be demonstrable progress,” said William Chou, a Japan expert and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a think tank. Without Japan’s investment announcements, “it was uncertain what Trump would have done — whether that was threatening a 25 percent tariff or firing off a few tweets,” Mr. Chou said. “Vibes are good between Trump and Takaichi, so why risk the unknown?” In a post on social media on Tuesday, Mr. Trump hailed the investments. “America is building again,” he wrote, adding that the projects “could not be done without one very special word, tariffs.” During a news conference on Wednesday in Tokyo, Japan’s trade minister, Ryosei Akazawa, said that each project would “promote the economic and national security interests” of both countries. Japanese companies would also benefit by supplying equipment for the projects and their related facilities, he added. Almost all of the spending in the first round of investments is slated for the construction of a natural gas power plant in Portsmouth, Ohio. The $33 billion facility is expected to be the largest natural gas power plant in the world, according to U.S. and Japanese officials. Japanese companies that have expressed interest in supplying the facility include Toshiba, Hitachi, Mitsubishi Electric and SoftBank Group, Mr. Akazawa said. In the months since Mr. Trump’s Tokyo visit, progress on how the $550 billion would be employed had been fitful. Debates have simmered in Japan over how to mobilize such vast sums of capital. Questions have been raised about the plan for the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, a state-owned lender, to serve as the primary financing vehicle for the commitment. Mr. Akazawa, who previously led Japan’s tariff negotiations with the United States, has consistently framed the investments as a “win-win” for both countries. Yet a different sentiment prevails within some business and state-backed finance circles, where the projects are often described as “strategic but less than bankable.” Japan’s investment decisions have also been complicated by an impending Supreme Court decision, expected in the coming months, about whether Mr. Trump exceeded his authority in using a 1970s law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs on dozens of U.S. trade partners. For Japan and many other nations, the threat of tariffs was a key motivator to pledge investments in the United States. That remains true even as officials, including those in Japan, seek to portray the investment decisions as purely strategic, according to David Boling, a principal at the Asia Group, a strategic advisory firm. “Would they be doing this normally? Probably not,” Mr. Boling said. But for Japan, keeping the U.S.-Japanese trade relationship in a good place is clearly the priority, he added. Strategic or not, he said, “there are other more compelling reasons to be doing this.” Hisako Ueno and Tony Romm contributed reporting.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Goldman Sachs is taking another step away from the diversity mandates the Wall Street firm had long championed. Goldman will no longer explicitly consider race, gender and sexual orientation when evaluating a potential board member at the firm, according to two people with knowledge of the bank’s decision who were unable to discuss it publicly because of the confidential nature of the move. The decision is a result of a deal that Goldman struck with the National Legal and Policy Center, a conservative nonprofit group that has been pressuring numerous companies to drop diversity, equity and inclusion mandates, the people said. The group recently announced similar deals with American Express and the equipment manufacturer Deere & Company. As part of its agreement with Goldman, the National Legal and Policy Center, which has a small investment in the bank, withdrew a shareholder proposal demanding that diversity criteria for the board be dropped. The deal was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal. Goldman’s move is part of a broader retreat by corporate America to shun diversity mandates during the Trump administration. The White House claims many of these initiatives amount to discrimination against white workers and job applicants. For years, Goldman’s chief executive, David Solomon, had been a vocal champion of the bank’s commitment to overhauling its traditionally white, male-dominated work force. In March 2019, Mr. Solomon, his top deputy John Waldron and the firm’s chief financial officer at the time, Stephen M. Scherr, declared diversity and inclusion “a top priority.” “When we unite around a common goal, we make progress together,” the men wrote in an email to the staff . They said they would “improve each year” toward goals that included a new recruiting class comprising “50 percent women, 11 percent Black professionals and 14 percent Hispanic/Latino professionals in the Americas, and 9 percent Black professionals in the U.K.” The next year, Mr. Solomon said Goldman would no longer take a company public in the United States or Europe unless it had at least one “diverse” board member. By 2021, a company would need at least two diverse board members in order for Goldman to agree to work on its initial public offering. But since President Trump returned to office, the political and legal winds on diversity have shifted, and Goldman’s commitment to D.E.I. has shifted, too. Last year, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission began questioning the hiring practices at elite law firms, claiming that their efforts to recruit Black and Hispanic lawyers may have potentially discriminated against white candidates. More recently, the agency said it was investigating “systemic allegations of D.E.I.-related intentional race discrimination” against white employees and job applicants at Nike. The sportswear company said it had been complying with the E.E.O.C.’s inquiry. Even before Mr. Trump began his second term, some diversity initiatives were facing legal scrutiny. In late 2024, a federal appeals court said Nasdaq’s rules that set racial and diversity targets for boards that listed on its exchange were invalid. Last February, Goldman said it would drop the policy that required boards of directors of U.S. companies to include women and members of minority groups if the bank was to serve as an underwriter on their initial public offerings. The same month, the firm scrapped the explicit goals it had earlier set for the racial and gender makeup of its recruiting classes. “It doesn’t change our strong belief that successful boards benefit from diverse backgrounds and perspectives,” a Goldman spokeswoman, Jennifer Zuccarelli, said of the recent moves. Goldman’s board is expected to move forward with the change to the diversity criteria for potential board members when it meets this week, the two people with knowledge of the matter said. The meeting will be the board’s first since it convened last week to consider the resignation of Goldman’s general counsel , Kathryn Ruemmler, who said she was stepping down after revelations emerged about her extensive relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. At the bank’s annual shareholder meeting last year, the National Legal and Policy Center’s associate director, Luke Perlot, praised Goldman for having “taken meaningful steps to roll back its D.E.I. programs.” Still, he proposed that the bank eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion goals around compensation for its named executive officers. On that point, the bank’s board recommended against dropping those compensation goals, and fewer than 5 percent of shareholders voted in favor eliminating them.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Revelations about ties to Jeffrey Epstein have toppled leaders of corporate America, Hollywood and academia as the Justice Department has released millions of documents and images from the disgraced financier’s files in recent months. But the Trump administration has steadfastly repelled such fallout, dismissing any associations that top officials had with the sex offender as trivial. The White House’s fortress mentality was mobilized last week after Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, acknowledged that he had traveled to Mr. Epstein’s private island and had another encounter with him years after Mr. Lutnick claimed to have cut ties with him. Such associations have led to the resignations of business leaders, but President Trump’s White House was unfazed. The stark contrast underscores the murky nature of who is deemed to be complicit and who is not when it comes to Mr. Epstein, and the Trump administration’s ability to repel even the most harsh public scrutiny. Despite bipartisan calls for Mr. Lutnick’s resignation, the White House dismissed concerns about his character and credibility. “Secretary Lutnick remains a very important member of President Trump’s team, and the president fully supports the secretary,” Karoline Leavitt, White House press secretary, said last week. Mr. Lutnick’s comments during Senate testimony contradicted his assertion on a podcast last year that he had been so disgusted by Mr. Epstein during a 2005 visit to his townhouse that Mr. Lutnick never set foot in a room with Mr. Epstein again. Mr. Lutnick’s name appeared in more than 250 documents in the Epstein files released by the Justice Department, a review by The New York Times found. He said that he first met Mr. Epstein when they became neighbors in Manhattan in 2005, but that they met only twice more over the next 14 years that he could recall. However, at the Senate hearing Mr. Lutnick confirmed that he and his family traveled to the island in 2012 for a lunch with Mr. Epstein during a vacation aboard his yacht with his wife, children, nannies and another family. The visit took place four years after Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida to soliciting prostitution from a minor as part of a deal with federal prosecutors. Mr. Lutnick is not the only prominent Trump administration official who has appeared in the Epstein documents. The records showed that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, once went hunting for dinosaur fossils with Mr. Epstein. An email in the files showed that Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, invited Mr. Epstein to a 2016 Valentine’s Day party. The Trump administration’s muted response is a striking departure from that of corporate America. Thomas J. Pritzker, a billionaire heir to the Hyatt Hotels fortune , stepped down from his role Monday as executive chairman of the Hyatt Hotels Corporation. Last week, Casey Wasserman, a Los Angeles entertainment executive and chair of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics whose name recently surfaced in the Epstein files, said he had started the process of selling the talent agency he founded more than two decades ago. And last year, Harvard started a new review of ties that its former president Lawrence H. Summers and others at the institution had with Mr. Epstein. After the release of emails between Mr. Summers and Mr. Epstein in November, Mr. Summers said he would step back from public commitments . “Corporate America, they answer to a board,” said Gene Grabowski, a Washington-based crisis communications expert. “Trump doesn’t answer to a board.” Mr. Grabowski added: “The closest thing he has is the voters, and he either doesn’t want to believe the polls or thinks he can reverse them.” A poll conducted last month by The New York Times and Siena University showed that Mr. Trump’s lowest approval rating within the Republican Party came on his handling of the release of files related to Mr. Epstein: Only 53 percent of Republicans approved of his handling of that matter. Mr. Lutnick’s ties to Mr. Epstein pale when compared with those of Mr. Trump, who socialized regularly with Mr. Epstein in the 1990s and 2000s . Using a proprietary search tool, The Times identified more than 5,300 files containing more than 38,000 references to Mr. Trump, his wife, his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, and other related words and phrases in the latest batch of emails, government files, videos and other records released by the Justice Department. Mr. Trump has downplayed his association with Mr. Epstein and accused Democrats of concocting conspiracy theories about their friendship. The president said last summer that he had ended his relationship with the financier because Mr. Epstein had “hired away” spa attendants at Mar-a-Lago. In defending Mr. Lutnick, the White House is again pushing the boundaries of its ability to weather a controversy that might have hobbled other administrations. “This administration has placed all its chips on the idea that the public will eventually tire of controversy, and now they’re betting that even allegations tied to pedophilia fall into that same bucket,” said Alexandra LaManna, who served as a spokeswoman in the Biden administration. “That’s a category of accusation that, historically, has been politically and morally radioactive.” Noting that Mr. Lutnick vacationed on Mr. Epstein’s island, she added: “It’s hard to imagine any president other than Trump trying to shrug that off.” Alan Rappeport is an economic policy reporter for The Times, based in Washington.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT This obituary was originally published on Feb. 17, 2001. It is being republished for a package for Women’s History Month. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Rose Freedman, the last survivor of the Triangle Shirtwaist fire in which 146 of her co-workers perished in 1911, died on Thursday in her apartment in Beverly Hills, Calif., her daughter said. She was 107. Mrs. Freedman, who at the time of the Manhattan fire was two days shy of 18, escaped death in 1911 by following company executives to the roof to be rescued. She became a lifelong crusader for worker safety, telling and retelling the story that the Triangle workers died because the owners were not concerned with their welfare. The disastrous factory fire, in which girls and young women leapt from eighth- and ninth-story windows, their flaming skirts billowing in the wind, horrified the nation and led to some of the first city, state and federal laws dealing with workers’ safety. It gave a powerful impetus to the fledgling labor movement, greatly strengthening the building of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, which two years before the fire had led a three-month strike to focus attention on conditions in workplaces like the Triangle factory. The union’s successor, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, confirmed that Mrs. Freedman, who was Rose Rosenfeld at the time of the fire, was the last survivor to die. The next-to-last, Bessie Cohen, died two years ago. Mrs. Freedman’s life after the fire was colorful and courageous. In World War I, she saved the life of a spy in Austria. After her husband’s death, in 1959, she went back to work to support her three children, two of whom had polio. Lying about her age, she worked at a Manhattan insurance company until she was 79. Mrs. Freedman, who always wore high heels, celebrated her centennial by attending Spanish classes in a Mexican town with cobblestone streets, but refused to abandon her heels for more sensible shoes. “I’d look matronly,” she said. Her involvement in the fire never left her consciousness, and she appeared at labor rallies for the rest of her life. She always expressed rage that the factory doors had been locked, either to keep workers at their machines or to prevent them from stealing scraps of cloth. She always told of how one of the owners tried to bribe her to say the doors were not locked. She refused. The owners were eventually acquitted of manslaughter charges when the jury could not establish whether they had ordered the doors locked or had even known they were. But in 1914, civil suits brought by relatives of 23 victims ended with payments of $75 to each of the families. On the day of the fire, Mrs. Freedman escaped the inferno by stopping to consider what the executives were doing. She somehow thought they would be safer, and went up to the 10th floor, where their offices were, to find out. They were taking the freight elevator to the roof, where firefighters pulled them to the roof of an adjacent building. She did the same. The alternative was jumping. “Girls in shirtwaists, which were aflame, went flying out of the building so that you saw these young women literally ablaze flying out of the windows,” she said in a Public Broadcasting System documentary, “The Living Century,” shown in December and January. As she was taken down the steps of the adjacent building, she stopped on each stoop to sit down and cry. “When I came in the street, here comes my father,” she recalled. “He collapsed. He fainted. And I didn’t go back to work anymore. I went to college.” The anger about what she saw as the owners’ greed persisted. In the documentary, she said: “That’s the whole trouble of this fire. Nobody cares. Nobody. Hundred forty-six people in a half an hour. I have always tears in my eyes when I think. It should never have happened. The executives with a couple of steps could have opened the door. But they thought they were better than the working people. It’s not fair because material, money, is more important here than everything. “That’s the biggest mistake — that a person doesn’t count much when he hasn’t got money. What good is a rich man and he hasn’t got a heart? I don’t pretend. I feel it. Still.” Rose Rosenfeld was born on March 27, 1893, in a small town north of Vienna. Her family ran a profitable business importing and exporting dried foods. After her father visited New York and fell in love with it, the family began spending more and more time in the United States, finally emigrating in 1909. They sailed on the Mauretania. With Mrs. Freedman’s father devoting most of his time to Jewish studies, the business was run by her mother. An aunt who lived with the family once sharply criticized the young woman’s housecleaning abilities. “You call this work?” she demanded. Mrs. Freedman’s response was to go out the next day and take a job at the Triangle factory. Since her language skills were good — she eventually spoke seven languages — she was given the prestigious job of operating a large machine to attach buttons to the blouses. Her only close friend at the factory, a forewoman, died in the fire. She attended college in New York, although family members are not sure where. When she and her mother took a trip to their Austrian hometown to show Mrs. Freedman’s grandparents that she was really alive, World War I had broken out, and the Russians had invaded Austria. Her grandfather had befriended a man who turned out to be a Russian spying against his own country for Austria. She told of hiding him by burying him in coal in the basement, then talking the pursuing Cossacks into leaving without a search. After returning to New York, she got a job with Cunard, the steamship line. In 1927, she married Harry Freedman, an American she had first met at the American Club in Vienna. He owned a typewriter store in New York. They had three children. When the two youngest were stricken with polio, Mrs. Freedman asked when they would be able to walk. The doctor said, “Five years.” She replied, “I have time.” Mr. Freedman died at 59, leaving Mrs. Freedman no money or source of income. She got an accounting job at the Manhattan Life Insurance Company. Her youthful appearance enabled her to say she was 50, when she was actually 64. “Of course it was a lie, but they didn’t know it was a lie,” she said. She worked until she was 79. In 1995, she moved to Los Angeles, where her son Robert and her daughter, Arlene March, live. There, she became such an avid fan of the Lakers that she became livid if someone phoned while a game was being shown on television. On her 100th birthday she was presented with a team jersey bearing the number 100. She exhibited paintings at the Beverly Hills Art Fair, and continued to paint almost until her death. She had her hair and nails done weekly, and shopped and cooked for herself. Mrs. Freedman was still attending Spanish language classes at 107. “To me, 106 is a number,” she said in the documentary. “I lived that long, not only on account of my genes, but on account of my attitude. You’ve got to stand up for yourself. Am I right?” Other survivors are another son, Herbert, of Rye Brook, N.Y., eight grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. She was overjoyed at the great-granddaughter’s birth, and always advised the child’s mother, her granddaughter, Dana Walden, who is president of 20th Century Fox Television, not to get caught in grief when loved ones died. “Sadness takes years from you,” she said. Her own passing ends a chapter of history. Steven Latham, director of the documentary, suggested it was something like the last Holocaust survivor dying. “This is the last voice of an event,” he said. “This woman actually smelled the smoke.” Share full article Related Content Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Bayer, the German pharmaceutical and biotech giant, said Tuesday that it had reached an agreement that would pay plaintiffs $7.25 billion to settle tens of thousands of lawsuits that claimed the weedkiller Roundup caused non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The agreement was submitted to a Missouri circuit court judge in St. Louis, and approval is not guaranteed. A $10 billion settlement unraveled in 2020 after a judge objected to how future claims would be handled. The latest deal would cover both current and future claims, and create a fund that Bayer would pay into over the next 17 to 21 years, according to a company statement. Bayer executives hailed the agreement as a significant step in the company’s efforts to control costs from litigation against Roundup, which Monsanto developed in the 1970s. Bayer acquired Monsanto in 2016. Since then, the company has set aside $10 billion to settle lawsuits over the herbicide. With this settlement, Bayer’s legal costs would approach $14 billion in total, according to Bayer’s statement. Bill Anderson, Bayer’s chief executive, previously said the company would stop manufacturing Roundup, which farmers around the world use to kill weeds and increase crop yields, if it couldn’t find a way to end the lawsuits. “Today marks an important milestone for the company,” Mr. Anderson said on a call announcing the settlement. Shares of Bayer rose more than 7 percent after the announcement. A major factor in driving the settlement is an upcoming Supreme Court case that will decide whether federal law shields Bayer from many Roundup-related lawsuits. Most of the lawsuits against Bayer have been filed in state courts, arguing that the company violated state labeling laws because it did not warn users that Roundup could cause cancer. Bayer argues that the Environmental Protection Agency has found Roundup to be safe and that, according to federal labeling standards, it should be protected from the more than 40,000 active lawsuits, of 170,000 total, that have been filed against the company. Ensuring that those suing received some compensation before the Supreme Court ruling was paramount. “If Monsanto prevails, many claims nationwide would be dismissed or curtailed,” said Christopher Seeger, one of the plaintiffs’ lawyers. If the settlement is approved, it will not be affected by the outcome of the Supreme Court case. Mr. Anderson, the Bayer chief executive, said the settlement “complements” the Supreme Court case, even though many of the cases that Bayer is settling could be invalidated if the justices rule in its favor. He said this agreement and a Supreme Court win would provide “the tightest possible form of containment” of litigation, by settling existing cases and making future cases easier to win. Bayer has played legal Whac-a-Mole since it acquired Monsanto, settling tens of thousands of suits against Roundup before reaching a trial. But a number have gone to trial and resulted in verdicts of hundreds of millions of dollars for a single case. Many of those awards have been reduced on appeal.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Stephen Colbert said on his late-night show on Monday that his network, CBS, barred him from airing an interview with a Democratic candidate for a U.S. Senate race because of new guidance from the Trump administration about equal airtime for political candidates. It’s the first time that a late-night talk show has changed its programming to meet the demands of that update from the Federal Communications Commission, which has over the last year ramped up its efforts to crack down on the major media companies for perceived bias. Mr. Colbert, a frequent critic of President Trump, made it clear he did not make the change willingly. Over six minutes on Monday’s edition of “The Late Show,” Mr. Colbert blasted Brendan Carr, the chairman of the F.C.C. And, in a rebuke of CBS, Mr. Colbert said that “because my network clearly doesn’t want us to talk about this, let’s talk about this.” Mr. Colbert said that CBS lawyers had told him “in no uncertain terms” that an interview he had planned for Monday’s show with State Representative James Talarico of Texas would not air on the show, even though the lawmaker was already in Mr. Colbert’s studio. Early voting began on Tuesday in the Texas primary election, where Mr. Talarico is competing against Jasmine Crockett to be the state’s Democratic nominee to run against Senator John Cornyn, a Republican. Mr. Colbert pointed to new guidance from the F.C.C. from January, warning media companies that talk shows carried on local broadcast networks were required to offer equal airtime to candidates competing for the same office. CBS pushed back on Mr. Colbert’s version of events on Tuesday, saying the network had “not prohibited” the interview from airing but that it instead “provided legal guidance” that broadcasting the interview could trigger the F.C.C. equal-time rule. CBS said it then presented the show “options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled.” There has long been an exemption to the F.C.C.’s equal-time rule for “bona fide news” programming, such as evening news programs. Media companies have long taken it as a given that late-night shows qualified for the same exemption, particularly after the F.C.C. ruled in 2006 that interviews on “The Tonight Show With Jay Leno” were considered bona fide news. After the F.C.C. issued its new guidance, Mr. Carr underscored that was no longer the case. “For years, legacy TV networks assumed that their late-night & daytime talk shows qualify as ‘bona fide news’ programs — even when motivated by purely partisan political purposes,” he said on X last month. “Today, the F.C.C. reminded them of their obligation to provide all candidates with equal opportunities.” Representatives for the F.C.C. and Mr. Colbert declined to comment. Mr. Trump has repeatedly lashed out against many late-night hosts since he returned to the White House last year — just this weekend, he insulted Bill Maher, the HBO talk show host, in a post on Truth Social. Mr. Carr has taken particular aim at late night and daytime television shows that he believes are biased. Last year, ABC removed “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” from its airwaves for almost a week after Mr. Carr suggested that the administration could punish the network because of remarks the late-night host had made in a monologue. Earlier this month, the F.C.C. started a probe into ABC’s “The View” because of an interview with Mr. Talarico, Fox News reported . On Monday’s show, Mr. Colbert repeatedly criticized Mr. Carr, at one point saying that he looked like a “smug bowling pin,” and saying that he believed Mr. Carr was “motivated by partisan purposes.” “Let’s just call this what it is,” Mr. Colbert said. “Donald Trump’s administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV because all Trump does is watch TV.” Mr. Colbert went on to say that he and Mr. Kimmel were “two of the people most affected by this threat” because they had promptly criticized the new guidance when it was announced last month. Because the equal-time provisions apply only to broadcast airwaves, Mr. Colbert announced his interview with Mr. Talarico would be posted to his show’s YouTube page, though he said that network lawyers told him not to give out a URL or a QR code to the link. That interview had more than 1.7 million views on YouTube early Tuesday afternoon, significantly more than the 93,000 views of a video of Mr. Colbert interviewing Jennifer Garner, who was also a guest on Monday’s episode. The F.C.C.’s lone Democratic commissioner, Anna Gomez, said on Tuesday that CBS’s refusal to air the interview was “another troubling example of corporate capitulation in the face of this administration’s broader campaign to censor and control speech.” Mr. Colbert is in his final months hosting “The Late Show,” which will go off the air in May. CBS has said that the show’s cancellation was “purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night,” but many have continued to speculate that the network removed the show for political reasons. CBS’s parent company, Paramount, is also competing with Netflix to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery. Any deal would require the blessing of the federal government.

Billy Barraclough for The New York Times Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 3:36 min Learn more Share full article 6 By Katie Robertson Feb. 17, 2026 Adam Baidawi recalls being enthralled by GQ magazine the first time he pored through an issue as a teenager in suburban Melbourne, Australia. Some two decades later — and on the other side of the world — Mr. Baidawi will now take the helm of the men’s magazine as its next global editorial director. Condé Nast, the publisher of GQ and other brands like Vogue and The New Yorker, on Tuesday announced Mr. Baidawi’s promotion to the top job, effective immediately. Mr. Baidawi, 35, who led British GQ and was the deputy global editorial director, will now oversee all of GQ, including its U.S. publication and its global editions, as well as the music publication Pitchfork , which was folded into GQ in 2024. He replaces the longtime GQ editor Will Welch , who announced in January after a run atop the masthead that he was leaving to move to Paris to work with Pharrell Williams, the musician and men’s creative director for Louis Vuitton. Mr. Baidawi’s appointment is the latest shake-up of the top editorial ranks at Condé Nast, which in recent months has promoted a new generation of internal talent. In June, Mark Guiducci , the 37-year-old creative director of Vogue, became the top editor of Vanity Fair. And last fall, Chloe Malle , 40, the editor of Vogue’s website, succeeded Anna Wintour as American Vogue’s top editor. (Ms. Wintour, 76, remains Vogue’s global editorial director as well as the chief content officer for Condé Nast.) Mr. Baidawi, who is Iraqi Australian, started his career as a music writer and wrote freelance articles for the Australian edition of GQ. He spent a year as an Australia correspondent for The New York Times before spotting a job advertisement looking for someone to launch GQ Middle East. He was named the editor in chief of GQ Middle East in 2018 at age 28, making him the youngest-ever editor in chief of a GQ edition.

Billy Barraclough for The New York Times In 2021, Mr. Baidawi became the deputy global editorial director of GQ and the head of editorial content of British GQ. In an interview from London, Mr. Baidawi said he wanted to restore GQ “to its rightful place as the North Star of masculinity” and to have the magazine be “more participatory in the cultural and political debates of our time.” Mr. Baidawi added that while there was a lot of hand wringing currently about the online “manosphere” and toxic masculinity, the current counterprogramming amounted to lectures and earnestness. “I’m curious to propose a version of masculinity that is yes, progressive, yes, modern, but is also sexier and cooler and more aspirational and more desirable than some of the nihilism or cruelty or vanity that we see out there,” he said. Mr. Baidawi also said he planned to incorporate more long-form video and long-form audio into the GQ brand. In a statement, Ms. Wintour described Mr. Baidawi as “a cultural thinker at a time when the culture needs to be thought through, and even interrogated a little.” “This is someone GQ’s readers can expect to challenge received wisdom — about modern masculinity and the worlds of celebrity, sport and fashion — and have a lot of fun doing so,” she said. Mr. Baidawi will relocate to New York, and his first print issue of GQ will publish in September. Katie Robertson covers the media industry for The Times.

Ricardo Nagaoka for The New York Times In today's newsletter: Paramount notches a win More Epstein files fallout Anthropic’s latest fight with Washington Goldman’s latest retreat on diversity Andrew here. Hope you enjoyed the long weekend. Today, Lauren Hirsch dives into Warner Bros. Discovery restarting merger talks with Paramount and explains what would make it walk away from a deal with Netflix. We also examine Goldman Sachs’s reported decision to drop a diversity requirement for its board. And we look at more fallout from the Epstein files. Paramount notches a win Paramount has sought for weeks to force Warner Bros. Discovery back to the M.&A. negotiating table. On Tuesday, it has finally received a chance to win the battle over the movie and television studio. Warner Bros. Discovery just said that it would restart merger talks with Paramount , giving its suitor roughly a week to make its case to abandon its deal with Netflix. Warner Bros. Discovery isn’t definitely switching sides. Its deal agreement with Netflix gives it the right to talk with a rival bidder if that is likely to lead to a “reasonably superior offer.” Warner Bros. Discovery doesn’t think that’s the case here — but Netflix has given it until Feb. 23 to talk with Paramount to clarify several questions about that company’s competing offer. For now, Warner Bros. Discovery’s board is still recommending that shareholders vote in favor of the Netflix offer. Netflix added in a separate statement: “This does not change the fact that we have the only signed, board-recommended agreement with W.B.D., and ours is the only certain path to delivering value to W.B.D.’s stockholders.” But Paramount has made headway in casting doubt on that. The rival studio has argued that its bid — a deal for all of Warner Bros. Discovery, instead of the more complicated structure of the Netflix transaction, which involves spinning out the Warner cable networks — offers more certainty for shareholders. It doesn’t hurt that a Paramount representative has said the company would raise its takeover price to $31 a share if the Warner Bros. Discovery board authorized talks, and suggested that the company could pay even more. (Paramount has already tossed in sweeteners such as offering to cover the Netflix deal’s $2.8 billion breakup fee and to pay Warner Bros. Discovery a quarterly “ticking fee” if its deal closes behind schedule.) And several Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders, including the hedge funds Ancora and Pentwater Capital Management , have pushed the studio operator to reopen talks with Paramount. (Warner Bros. Discovery has now set March 20 as the date for an investor vote on the Netflix offer.) Big questions remain: How much higher would Netflix be willing to raise its offer for any counterbid? Worth noting: Shares in the streaming giant rose this morning, after having fallen since clinching a deal for Warner Bros. Discovery. How would Paramount finance a higher takeover bid, given that Warner Bros. Discovery has expressed concern about how much debt it already plans to use ? HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING The Fed weighs moves to bolster bank lending. The central bank is preparing to ease capital requirements for U.S. banks , a vice chair, Michelle Bowman, announced on Monday. Banks have seen their share of mortgage originations in the U.S. fall to 35 percent in 2023 from 60 percent in 2008, Bowman said. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has blamed capital regulations for driving lending to nonbank financial services companies. California and Britain strike a clean energy deal. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an agreement on Monday that calls for the two sides to bolster efforts to collaborate on green tech and invest in clean energy. It comes as the Trump administration has dismantled some legal protections for climate and Biden administration initiatives to advance a low-carbon transition. President Trump called the deal “ inappropriate .” The Fed, earnings and inflation data top investors’ agenda this week. Minutes from the central bank’s January meeting are set for release on Wednesday, offering clues about policymakers’ thinking on interest rates. Walmart, Wayfair and Klarna report quarterly results on Thursday, providing more insight on the state of the consumer. The Personal Consumption Expenditures report, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, is scheduled for publication on Friday. Image More Epstein files fallout The Jeffrey Epstein files continue to jolt corporate America , including Hollywood. The heat is also growing in Washington and academia . The latest: Thomas Pritzker, a scion of the Hyatt Hotels empire, stepped down on Monday as executive chairman of the hotels giant, after the files revealed that he was in regular contact with the convicted sex offender in the years after Epstein’s 2008 plea deal on sex crimes charges. Pritzker and Epstein corresponded frequently as they arranged appointments, including visits to Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse. In a 2018 email exchange, Pritzker agreed to help Karyna Shuliak, Epstein’s girlfriend, arrange a trip to Southeast Asia. After Shuliak told Pritzker she was going there “to try to find a new girlfriend for Jeffrey,” Pritzker responded with a smiley-face emoticon and wrote, “May the Force be with you.” Pritzker said in a statement released on Monday that he had “exercised terrible judgment in maintaining contact with” Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s longtime companion. “There is no excuse for failing to distance myself sooner,” he added. Pritzker, a cousin of JB Pritzker, a Democrat and the governor of Illinois, also said he would not seek re-election to Hyatt’s board in May. And then there’s Casey Wasserman. The sports and entertainment mogul, whose decades-old flirtatious messages with Maxwell appeared in the files, is facing increased pressure to step down as chairman of LA28 , the organizing committee for the Olympics in Los Angeles. Karen Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles, on Monday became the highest-ranking elected official to call on Wasserman to resign from LA28. “I do think that we need to look at the leadership,” she said after criticizing the Olympic organizers’ decision last week to back Wasserman. Wasserman announced on Friday that he had begun the process of selling the Wasserman Group , his powerhouse talent agency that has experienced some high-profile defections since the latest Epstein revelations. “I’m deeply sorry that my past personal mistakes have caused you so much discomfort,” he wrote to employees. In related news, some politicians in Ohio have begun distancing themselves from Les Wexner . Wexner, the billionaire founder of L Brands and an early patron of Epstein, had been a major donor to several local races there. Attorney General Pam Bondi’s combative congressional testimony last week over the Epstein investigation continued to draw anger from the right. Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, said he had lost confidence in Bondi days after some right-wing political commentators called for her resignation . Anthropic’s latest fight with Washington Anthropic’s stated focus on safety has set it apart in the artificial intelligence race — and drawn the ire of some White House officials. A new report suggests that the Trump administration is weighing a move that could deal the A.I. start-up a big blow, underscoring a major disagreement between the two sides on how to deploy the technology. The Pentagon is threatening to cut ties with Anthropic, and more, Axios reports . More specifically, the Defense Department is considering designating Anthropic a “supply chain risk,” meaning that other military contractors would have to stop working with the company, too. It’s a designation typically reserved for overseas adversaries, Axios adds. The threat aris",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Warner Bros. Discovery said on Tuesday that it would restart the deal talks with Paramount Skydance that it ended in December, giving the company another chance at besting Netflix for a deal. Paramount will have until Feb. 23 to negotiate its best and final offer. Warner Bros. Discovery last year rejected Paramount’s offer to buy the entire company for $108 billion in favor of a deal to sell only its streaming and studios business to Netflix for $83 billion. Warner Bros. Discovery said at the time that Netflix offered the better deal for shareholders. Paramount disagreed and quickly made its case to shareholders through a hostile bid . In the roughly two months since then, Paramount has amended its offer twice , each time addressing some of the concerns that Warner Bros. Discovery’s board had raised. Paramount’s chief executive, David Ellison, has also raised questions about the Netflix bid, including whether its deal can pass regulatory scrutiny. Some Warner Bros. Discovery investors, including Pentwater Capital Management, have also raised concerns, encouraging the company to restart talks with Paramount. Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Skydance were both up about 3 percent in premarket trading. To date, Paramount has not publicly raised its offer from $30 a share. But last week, Warner Bros. Discovery said that a senior representative for Paramount had verbally informed a company board member that, if the board authorized talks with Paramount, it would agree to pay $31 a share. In that conversation, the Paramount representative added that it would be willing to further improve its offer. “It’s about time the actual headline price bidding heated up in what has to be one of the most inactive corporate bidding wars in history,” Eric Talley, a business professor at Columbia Law School, said. In a letter to the Paramount board on Tuesday, David Zaslav, the chief executive of Warner Bros. Discovery, and Samuel A. DiPiazza Jr., chairman of the company, said: “We welcome the opportunity to engage with you and expeditiously determine whether PSKY can deliver an actionable, binding proposal that provides superior value.” In Paramount’s latest offer, it agreed to pay the $2.8 billion fee Warner Bros. Discovery would owe to Netflix if their agreement were terminated, as well as agreeing to back Warner Bros. Discovery’s debt costs. Paramount also said it would pay Warner Bros. Discovery’s shareholders around $650 million in cash, starting in 2027, for each quarter that the deal did not close. Warner Bros. Discovery said Tuesday that it had requested a number of clarifications about Paramount’s latest proposal. Among them were concerns about the extent of Paramount’s support for Warner Bros. Discovery’s debt costs and the conditions under which Paramount could legally walk away from a deal. It also wanted assurances that Paramount would be willing to contribute more equity if its debt financing fell apart. According to the terms of Warner Bros. Discovery’s contract with Netflix, it can engage in talks with a rival bidder if it thinks it can lead to a “reasonably superior offer.” Warner Bros. Discovery said in its letter on Tuesday that it did not yet think that Paramount’s offer met that bar — but that Netflix had given Warner Bros. Discovery a seven-day waiver to see if it could clarify its concerns. “Throughout the robust and highly competitive strategic review process, Netflix has consistently taken a constructive, responsive approach with WBD, in stark contrast to Paramount Skydance,” Netflix said in a statement released on Tuesday. “While we are confident that our transaction provides superior value and certainty, we recognize the ongoing distraction for WBD stockholders and the broader entertainment industry caused by PSKY’s antics.” On Tuesday, Paramount acknowledged Warner Bros. Discovery’s decision, saying in a statement that it had opted to secure a waiver rather than deeming Paramount’s bid as one that could be reasonably expected to be superior. In doing so, Paramount said, Warner Bros. Discovery did not allow itself “an unfettered right to negotiate without a time deadline.” “Although the board’s actions are unusual,” the statement said, “Paramount is nonetheless prepared to engage in good faith and constructive discussions.” If Paramount makes a superior offer, Netflix has the right to improve its own bid. Shares of Netflix have been under pressure since it announced the deal in December, falling about 15 percent this year. Its stock rose 1.5 percent in premarket trading. Discovery said on Tuesday that it had scheduled a shareholder vote on Netflix’s offer for March 20. Lauren Hirsch is a Times reporter who covers deals and dealmakers in Wall Street and Washington.

Eric Lee for The New York Times Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 11:29 min Learn more Share full article 485 By Tony Romm Reporting from Washington Feb. 17, 2026 Shortly after returning to office, President Trump embarked on an aggressive campaign to pare back the core functions of the federal government, unveiling a budget that proposed some of the steepest spending reductions in U.S. history. Nearly one year later, Congress has rejected much of that vision. In a little-noticed development, lawmakers have systematically brushed off many of Mr. Trump’s most severe cuts for this fiscal year, leaving intact a vast set of federal education, health, housing and research programs that the White House had tried to slash or eliminate. For Mr. Trump, the result is a set of annual government expenses that do not appear radically different on paper compared with what he inherited in January 2025. Overall, Congress is on track to approve more than $1.6 trillion in discretionary spending for 2026, amounting to little change from the previous fiscal year, according to a preliminary analysis of federal budget records by the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan research organization.

Targeting primarily domestic programs, Mr. Trump had originally recommended about $163 billion in deep spending cuts . But lawmakers often did not abide, and in the end, some of the funding that the president had tried to erase — including for medical research, college aid and benefits for poor people — instead changed only slightly, the data show. Mr. Trump still prevailed in other ways, most notably in his efforts to scale back the size and reach of government by ousting thousands of federal workers. Still, the outcome on Capitol Hill underscores the complex and fraught politics of austerity: Where the president sees evidence of spending that is woke, weaponized or wasteful , his critics in both parties see money that is essential to their communities and the broader economy. At times, the difficult dynamic has put the White House at odds with some congressional Republicans, many of whom are up for re-election this November. That has only reinforced Mr. Trump’s desire to circumvent lawmakers altogether, using a series of contested and potentially illegal maneuvers to revoke billions in congressionally approved spending that the president disfavors. Kent Smetters, the faculty director for the Penn Wharton Budget Model, said that, for now, Congress had “basically rejected” everything that Mr. Trump had sought. By law, the White House must send Congress a budget by the first Monday in February — a deadline that presidents from both parties have regularly missed without consequence. The administration is expected to release its latest blueprint for the 2027 fiscal year as soon as next month. Still, Mr. Smetters added that the result this year illustrated a well-worn truth that presidential budgets are “aspirational in nature,” and that in the fight to trim spending, there are always “strong vested interests” for keeping federal funds intact. To come to the preliminary budget estimates, The New York Times analyzed spending across the 11 appropriations bills adopted by Congress, primarily using early data furnished by Democrats on the Senate Appropriations Committee and a set of outside groups, including Penn Wharton. A final, 12th bill, covering homeland security, has not yet passed. Top Republican appropriators did not respond to requests for comment. The analysis focused primarily on domestic spending, not defense, which Mr. Trump has increased considerably in his first year back in office. He secured some of that military funding as part of his sprawling tax legislation, which was paid for in part by cutting back benefits in programs like Medicaid and food stamps. In effect, the changes broke with a long-running tradition in Washington to treat defense and domestic spending with parity, a development that the administration sees as one of its signature victories. The White House nonetheless maintains that it has meaningfully changed the nation’s fiscal trajectory during Mr. Trump’s second term. The administration has already moved to shutter entire agencies and revoke billions in spending previously authorized by Congress. That includes rescinding about $14 billion that lawmakers adopted for foreign aid and public broadcasting last year. Some of the cuts, including federal support for the organization that funds NPR, were sustained by Congress in recent months, which helped to lower the overall amount spent by the government in 2026, according to officials at the White House budget office, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe their thinking. “The appropriations bills, reconciliation, rescissions, all the different tools we are using — it’s the end of futility,” Russell T. Vought, the director of the budget office, said in a statement, referring to the legislative processes that allowed Mr. Trump to enact his tax legislation and repeal past spending. Image President Trump’s budget proposed some of the steepest spending cuts in U.S. history. Credit... Kenny Holston/The New York Times Marc Goldwein, the senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said that the president’s actions in his first year in office carried mixed budgetary implications. On one hand, he said the Trump administration did not “get a big nominal cut in spending” in Congress for the 2026 fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30. But Mr. Goldwein, whose group supports deficit reduction, said the White House did manage to ward off perennial spending increases for domestic programs, which still amounted to a “big victory.” Last spring, for example, Mr. Trump took his first steps to try to dismantle the Education Department, where he and his aides froze funds and either fired or reassigned staff members without congressional approval. Yet Democrats and Republicans adopted a funding deal in late January that provisioned $79 billion for the agency, a slight increase from 2025, the data show. They also rejected some of the president’s ideas, including his attempt to sharply reduce funding for Pell grants, which aid low-income college students. At the White House, officials said they still believe that they can proceed with their attempts to dissolve the department and relocate its staff this year, arguing that the new funding legislation did not explicitly prevent them from doing so. Lawmakers similarly rejected steep cuts proposed by Mr. Trump for agencies including the Departments of Commerce, Labor and Health and Human Services, which saw only slight changes to their overall, annual budgets, the records show. And they jettisoned some of Mr. Trump’s most significant attempts to whittle down antipoverty programs, particularly federal housing assistance. The president initially proposed overhauling — and halving — the funding for a stable of benefits that includes housing vouchers, which serve about 2.4 million low-income households . But Congress did not weigh his proposed restructuring. Instead",

Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 4:13 min Learn more Share full article 2 By Natallie Rocha Visuals by Minh Connors Reporting from San Francisco Feb. 17, 2026 If you had to ask whose forehead was plastered on a billboard along San Francisco’s Route 101 last month, you were clearly not in the start-up world. The large ad, declaring “Target Marc on TV,” was among a smattering of head-scratching billboards by Vibe, a New York-based advertising technology start-up, that put the insider culture of tech on full display. The forehead alluded to one of the tech industry’s most well-known investors, Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Another nearby wallscape showed just a leather-clad shoulder, a nod to Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chip maker Nvidia, who is known for his fondness for black motorcycle jackets . A billboard for Elon Musk, the Tesla mogul who also owns the social media network X, pictured a kitchen sink — a nod to a viral video of Mr. Musk carrying a sink into Twitter’s office in 2022 with the caption “let that sink in.” Image The forehead of the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen can be quickly spotted by a subset of tech industry insiders. Vibe’s campaign, which ran through January, was playing a tech industry insider game: targeting a tiny audience of tech investors and influencers who would get the joke and — just maybe — try to find who was behind those billboards. And while other ad campaigns have forced Bay Area residents to decode tech lingo, Vibe’s billboards took obscurity to a new level of microtargeting. “These are people that everyone in the Valley wants to talk to,” said Arthur Querou, chief executive of Vibe, which creates targeting and analytics software for companies to run advertisements on streaming services. Mr. Querou said one of Vibe’s products offered an advertising algorithm to place streaming ads in front of specific people, like executives in a particular region. That’s why, he said, the recent billboards nod to Silicon Valley celebrities who clients may want to “target” on TV. “It’s very recognizable,” Mr. Querou said of the ad campaign. “Of course, a lot of people in S.F. will not understand the joke, but the people we want to talk to do get the joke.” Image The “Jensen” in question is Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia who often wears black leather jackets. There are billions being invested in San Francisco’s start-up scene right now, and a lot of that money will go toward marketing. Mr. Querou hopes his analog ads will lead start-ups to put some of that cash toward streaming ads with his firm. Advertising on a San Francisco billboard or wallscape can cost anywhere from $15,000 for a downtown ad to the low six figures for prime signage along Route 101 for about six weeks, said Christopher Tavlarides, president of Capitol Outdoor, which owns about 30 billboards across the Bay Area. Mr. Tavlarides said the demand for ad space had increased over the past year, especially for billboards near certain tech offices or venture capital firms. But for those who aren’t in on the joke, the deluge of tech ads have become white noise. “To be honest, it’s too vague for me, and I feel that’s the point,” said James Markert, looking up at a brick wall that said “Target Tim on TV” next to a bitten red apple. The “Tim” in question was Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple. Image Another billboard refers to Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple. Mr. Markert, a bartender in the city’s Jackson Square neighborhood, said he had no idea what “Tim” this ad was targeting. While Vibe’s billboards have gone viral online, Mr. Querou said he was “a bit sad” to not have heard from the tech executives they called out yet. Representatives for Apple, Nvidia and SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment. Image One of Vibe’s billboards was inspired by a 2022 video of Elon Musk carrying a sink during his takeover of Twitter. Still, Mr. Querou received plenty of texts from friends he went to college with at the University of California, Berkeley. Some of them now work in San Francisco as engineers at big tech companies, not start-ups, and sent him pictures of the billboards. But they still didn’t know whom the “Marc” ads were targeting, he said. Danielle Jing, who works at a start-up down the block from the Jackson Square Apple ad, didn’t get the joke. She squinted up at the wallscape on her walk back to the office on a recent evening and said it must just be for “online tech people.” But the forehead billboard along Route 101? She said she immediately knew that reference because she used to work in venture capital. Mr. Andreessen, the owner of that viral forehead, did not respond to a request for comment.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT For nearly 20 years, Anderson Cooper has had a rare double billing in the TV industry: anchor on CNN and correspondent for “60 Minutes,” the celebrated newsmagazine on CBS. Now, he’s back to being a solo act. On Monday evening, Mr. Cooper said he was leaving “60 Minutes” to spend more time with his two young sons “while they still want to spend time with me.” “Being a correspondent at ‘60 Minutes’ has been one of the great honors of my career,” Mr. Cooper said. “I got to tell amazing stories, and work with some of the best producers, editors and camera crews in the business.” After juggling his jobs at CNN and CBS with the demands of raising two boys, Mr. Cooper said, he wants “to spend as much time with them as possible.” Mr. Cooper’s departure will be a blow for “60 Minutes,” where he has been a contributor since 2006. Over the years, Mr. Cooper, 58, has become one of the program’s most recognizable journalists, winning Emmy Awards for his coverage of sexual assault in the Democratic Republic of Congo and for a story about an unlikely group of Grammy-nominated musicians in Malawi’s Zomba Prison. In a statement, CBS News said it was thankful that Mr. Cooper had “taken ‘60 Minutes’ viewers on journeys to faraway places, told us unforgettable stories, reported consequential investigations and interviewed many prominent figures.” “We’re grateful to him for dedicating so much of his life to this broadcast, and understand the importance of spending more time with family,” the statement said. “‘60 Minutes’ will be here if he ever wants to return.” “60 Minutes” has come under scrutiny recently because of tensions between its on-air correspondents and Bari Weiss, the recently appointed editor in chief of CBS News. The program itself became a story late last year after Ms. Weiss made a last-minute decision to hold a segment about a prison in El Salvador over the objections of Sharyn Alfonsi, the veteran “60 Minutes” correspondent who covered the story. Ms. Weiss said the piece needed more reporting; Ms. Alfonsi said the decision was motivated by politics. The story eventually ran with minimal changes. Ms. Weiss later said in a town-hall meeting with employees in January that she had no desire to repeat “that specific logistical nightmare,” of pulling a story so close to broadcast, ever again. In recent years, Mr. Cooper’s career has encompassed much more than TV news. He has written several books, most recently a historical biography chronicling the wealthy Astor family. (Mr. Cooper is a scion of another Gilded Age dynasty, the Vanderbilts.) He also hosts a podcast about grief and bereavement, “All There Is,” which explores loss with in-depth interviews. Mr. Cooper’s departure was earlier reported by Breaker, an email newsletter. Benjamin Mullin reports for The Times on the major companies behind news and entertainment.

Haiyun Jiang/The New York Times Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 15:18 min Learn more Share full article By Ana Swanson Ana Swanson has written about international trade for over a decade. She reported from Washington. Feb. 16, 2026 On Jan. 26, 2025, Jamieson Greer was teaching Sunday school to a group of 9-year-olds when one of his phones started blowing up with calls from the White House. Six days into the new administration, President Trump was already deploying his favorite weapon: the threat of crippling tariffs to bend countries to his will. This time, the president was threatening Colombia, after it refused to accept U.S. military planes of deported immigrants. Mr. Greer would not join the Trump administration for some time yet, but he was already a key adviser on trade, flying to Mar-a-Lago in the weeks before to help plan Mr. Trump’s agenda. “Why do you have two phones?” a student asked him. “I have a kind of crazy job,” Mr. Greer replied. As the United States trade representative, Mr. Greer, 45, has been a powerful but behind-the-scenes force in transforming the global economy. His calm demeanor is often overshadowed in a cabinet filled with outspoken, brash billionaires. Yet few have done more in Mr. Trump’s second term to put into practice the president’s vision of altering the system governing how trillions of dollars of goods move around the world. Mr. Greer has provided the legal and policy framework to overhaul a global system Mr. Trump slams as unfair. He has helped the president raise tariffs to their highest levels in nearly a century while simultaneously leading negotiations with all of America’s biggest trading partners. So far, he has helped Mr. Trump reach initial trade arrangements with dozens of countries. Interviews with Mr. Greer make clear that he is a true believer in Mr. Trump’s plan to use tariffs to revitalize the United States manufacturing sector. He and other advisers have ushered in steep import taxes to try to protect manufacturers from foreign competition, coax more factories into the United States and create more good-paying factory jobs. “What the president has done is amazing,” Mr. Greer said in an interview in January. “He has restructured global trade.” It’s not yet clear those initiatives will work. Manufacturing employs less than 10 percent of Americans, and the number of factory workers has been dwindling. While some manufacturers support protectionism, others say it raises their costs and makes U.S. industry less competitive. Consumers are also concerned about tariffs increasing prices , and polls show Mr. Trump losing support for his handling of the economy. Though Mr. Greer credits the president’s tariff threats with giving him leverage in negotiations, Mr. Trump’s penchant for brinkmanship has clearly added uncertainty and complications to how countries deal with the United States. Mr. Trump has continued to threaten countries with tariffs, even if they have already agreed to trade deals, leaving companies unsure how permanent his policies are. This year seems likely to bring more tumult, as the Supreme Court reviews whether to overturn many of these tariffs. The administration is also preparing for high-stakes meetings with China, and negotiations with Canada and Mexico that could transform or dissolve the North American trade deal. Mr. Greer is often seen as a source of stability in the chaos. A former Mormon missionary and military lawyer, he has quietly navigated the demands of an unpredictable president, other big personalities in the cabinet, and the dozens of foreign leaders and company executives whose fortunes are tied up in trade. Friends say he has followed the advice of his mentor and former boss, Robert E. Lighthizer, who served as the U.S. trade representative in Mr. Trump’s first term: “You can get a lot done in Washington if you don’t care who gets the credit.” Mr. Greer’s small agency has only about 250 people, and he has not always been included in important administration decisions. In April, as he was testifying before Congress to defend the global tariffs Mr. Trump had just announced, the president surprised lawmakers and Mr. Greer by suddenly pausing them. But those close to Mr. Greer say he has built a solid relationship with the president. Mr. Trump has turned to him to coordinate issues beyond trade, like investment and security deals with Saudi Arabia, Cambodia and Thailand. Mr. Greer said that while he may not be a billionaire or political celebrity like other officials, he was chosen for a simple reason: “I know my brief.” Reading ‘Les Mis’ in Mortaritaville Image Mr. Greer during his time serving as a military lawyer in Iraq, where he was stationed at a base known as “Mortaritaville.” Credit... via the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative Mr. Greer is known as being preternaturally calm, a trait that some who know him say stems from being the father of five children. He credited his time as a military lawyer in Iraq, where he had to pause cross-examinations to shelter under a desk from mortar fire. “Listen, as long as nobody’s bombing me, I’m in good shape,” he said. Mr. Greer’s membership among Washington’s elite was not predictable. Raised in a working-class family in Paradise, Calif., he grew up in a mobile home, the fourth of five children, and worked during the summers and school year as a dishwasher and at McDonald’s. His parents valued education and Mr. Greer was drawn to the yellow-trimmed National Geographics that arrived in the mail each month. He attended Brigham Young University and served for two years during college as a Mormon missionary in Belgium, France and Luxembourg. In a white shirt and tie, Mr. Greer spent his days speaking to locals and refugees from Kosovo and Rwanda, an experience that opened his eyes to international relations and taught him fluent French that he still uses in trade negotiations. At B.Y.U., Mr. Greer joined the military and met his future wife, Marlo. After law school in Virginia and a stint studying in Paris, he served as a military lawyer in Kansas, Turkey and Iraq, where he was stationed at a base nicknamed “Mortaritaville,” reading “Les Misérables” in French between bombardments.

Credit... Rod Lamkey/Associated Press He was set on a path toward his future role as the architect of Mr. Trump’s trade strategy by what he called a “serendipitous” interview with Mr. Lighthizer for a job in Washington at the law firm Skadden Arps. Mr. Lighthizer said Mr. Greer impressed him as someone with “brains and values,” and hired Mr. Greer in 2012 to help the firm defend U.S. Steel and other American companies in trade cases. That work gave Mr. Greer an advance look at what U.S. industries would face in the coming years, as Chinese exports heavily subsidized by Beijing flooded global markets. Jeffrey Gerrish, who worked with Mr. Greer at Skadden Arps and at the trade representative’s office, said Mr. Greer was “right on the front lines” as Chinese goods began decimating U.S. industry. “He saw the kinds of impacts that it was having, not only on the companies, but on the workers and really entire communities,” Mr. Gerrish said. Mr. Greer saw the influx of cheap goods as a national security issue, but few Republicans or Democrats agreed. That changed with Mr. Trump’s election in 2016, when Mr. Lighthizer became U.S. trade representative and appointed Mr. Greer as his chief of s",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Mothers of young children surged into the work force during the Covid-19 pandemic, propelled by a tight labor market, federal child care subsidies and the sudden abundance of remote jobs. Years later, they are still on the job. The share of women with children under 5 who are working or looking for work peaked at nearly 71 percent in September 2023 and continues to float above prepandemic levels, according to an analysis of government data from the Hamilton Project , an economic policy research group at the Brookings Institution. The growth is partly because more employers have flexible office policies, an enduring legacy of the pandemic era. More jobs are at least partly remote, so parents — especially mothers who often shoulder most of their families’ child care duties — can better balance their responsibilities as employees and caregivers. This is particularly true for highly educated women in white-collar jobs. There is probably also a bleaker catalyst for the elevated labor force participation among mothers with young children, some economists believe: More women feel they must earn a paycheck to afford family life . “It’s not something to be proud of,” said Kathryn Anne Edwards, a labor economist and policy consultant. “If anything, it just reflects that they might be more desperate for money.” For families across the country, the cost of living has become an escalating challenge . Grocery prices have increased more than 25 percent over the past five years. Many Americans are straining to pay for health care, education and housing. Child care prices in most states have increased more than twice as fast as prices overall, according to the Century Foundation , a left-leaning think tank. The financial pressure may be compelling more mothers of young children, who generally work less than other women in their prime working years, to enter and remain in the labor force. Hiring in January was stronger than expected , the Labor Department reported on Wednesday. Kelsey Whitlatch, a mother of two in Moundsville, W.Va., left her job as a hairstylist in October 2023, a month before her second son was born. A year later, she got a job at a day care, but it closed soon after. Ms. Whitlatch, 28, said she considered not working to focus on her children, who are now 5 and 2. But her husband, a bridge inspector for the state, does not make enough money to support their family on his own, especially with the rising costs of groceries and utilities. During months when she wasn’t working, her family relied on food stamps and struggled to pay bills. She fell so behind on payments for her car that she worried it would be repossessed. “We were going under so bad,” she said. She now brings home about $400 a week taking care of a handful of children along with another mother who had worked at the day care. She also has a business, Sugar Mommas Cottage Home Bakery, that sells cookies and elaborately frosted cakes. “Every day I’m grateful — I know we could definitely be way worse,” she said. “I’m glad we’re at least sustaining, to some extent.” Image During months when Ms. Whitlatch wasn’t working, her family relied on food stamps and struggled to pay bills. Credit... Rebecca Kiger for The New York Times Mothers of young children have a lower labor force participation rate than other women for many reasons, including a lack of affordable child care and caregiving duties that are in tension with work schedules. Women who drop out of the labor force tend to do so around the time when their children are born, and rejoin when their children are older and parenting responsibilities are less consuming. The labor force participation rate for mothers with children ages 5 to 12 was about 77 percent at the end of last year. But being a stay-at-home mother for any amount of time is possible only if a family can live on one income. That arrangement appears increasingly out of reach. More than 70 percent of Americans last year said raising children was unaffordable, according to the American Family Survey , an annual poll of 3,000 Americans. “What is noticeable is just how widespread this concern is,” said Chris Karpowitz, a political science professor at Brigham Young University and one of the survey’s authors. “Americans of all stripes are worried about the cost of raising kids.” Poorer families are being squeezed even harder by slower wage growth, persistent inflation and rising child care costs, said Corinne Low, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of “Having It All: What Data Tells Us About Women’s Lives and Getting the Most Out of Yours.” That, coupled with a downshift in hiring, has made many families more reliant on second “flex” earners to pick up the slack. “One of the things that means is families might not be able to afford not having Mom in the labor market,” she said. Other factors keeping more women with young children in the labor force include a change in employers’ expectations about where work is done. White-collar professions are often more conducive to remote-work arrangements, and many companies have become less strict about in-person work. That has allowed some women to set office schedules that align more with child care hours. Women have also benefited from a boom in the health care industry, which has powered employment growth. More than 40 percent of the 2.8 million jobs created from November 2023 to November 2025 were held by women in health care and social assistance, according to an Indeed Hiring Lab analysis of government data. Roles such as nursing, though often in person, have set shifts that allow mothers to more reliably anticipate their child care needs, Dr. Low said. “It works for women because it is structured and it is predictable and it has strong boundaries,” she said. Efforts are underway in New Mexico, New York City and elsewhere to make child care more accessible, which could bolster the labor force participation rate for mothers with young children. Yet a shortage in affordable child care is a prevailing obstacle. Pandemic-era child care subsidies have expired. The federal government is trying to freeze roughly $10 billion in funding for child care and social services destined for New York, California, Minnesota, Illinois and Colorado, which are all led by Democrats. And evidence is emerging that the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown is shrinking the supply of child care workers, worsening the problem. Image Cameron Hulin of Youngsville, La., has a 3-year-old daughter and a baby on the way. Child care costs are so high that she plans to leave her job this spring to be a stay-at-home mother. Credit... Lily Brooks for The New York Times Cameron Hulin, 28, lives in Youngsville, La., and has a 3-year-old daughter. She and her husband, an electrician, have cut down their expenses but are still struggling to pay roughly $550 a month to send their daughter to preschool. They have been trying to sell their house and downsize, but have not had any luck. With another baby on the way, Ms. Hulin and her husband decided it made sense for her to become a stay-at-home mother rather than pay for child care for two children. She plans to leave her job in child advocacy at a nonprofit in May, when her daughter’s program ends for the summer. “It’s hard stepping away from something I enjoy,” she said. But she added, “My purpose is going to be fulfilled still, being there with my kids.” Sydney Ember is a Times business reporter, covering the U.S. economy and the labor market.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT President Trump has frequently claimed that foreign countries were paying for his tariffs, not Americans. But as economists predicted, that is largely turning out not to be the case. Research published on Thursday by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Columbia University suggests that, through November 2025, 90 percent of the economic burden of the president’s tariffs fell on U.S. companies and consumers. The economists reviewed the “incidence” of the tariffs — who ultimately pays the cost of new import taxes . When a good is brought into the country, the importer of record, often an American company, is first responsible for paying the tariff to the U.S. government. But the importer can pass that cost on to others by raising the prices it charges its customers, or by negotiating more favorable contracts with its suppliers. Mr. Trump and his advisers have said the cost of tariffs would be shouldered by foreign suppliers. They believed that foreign companies would respond to tariffs by reducing their prices, to maintain their access to the large and important U.S. consumer market. In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal on Jan. 30 defending his tariffs, Mr. Trump wrote, “the data shows that the burden, or ‘incidence,’ of the tariffs has fallen overwhelmingly on foreign producers and middlemen, including large corporations that are not from the U.S.” “In many cases, nations that are heavily dependent on exports have had no choice but to ‘eat’ the tariffs to avoid even worse losses from their excess capacity,” he added, appearing to incorrectly interpret some statistics. Although data shows foreign suppliers react to tariffs by reducing their prices in some instances, economic research suggests that is not the most common response. The New York Fed study found that, from January 2024 to November 2025, the bulk of the tariff costs fell on U.S. firms and consumers. In the first eight months of 2025, 94 percent of the tariff incidence was borne by the United States, they said. “In sum, U.S. firms and consumers continue to bear the bulk of the economic burden of the high tariffs imposed in 2025,” the study found. The same researchers studied the effect of tariffs in Mr. Trump’s first term, where they found that tariffs in 2018 and 2019 were wholly passed on to American businesses and consumers. Businesses across the country have spent the last year trying to navigate Mr. Trump’s changing tariff policies. Larger companies have generally been able to handle the higher import duties without raising prices significantly on consumers. In some cases, their size helped them to negotiate discounts with suppliers who rely on their business, helping to offset the cost of the tariffs. Because they often have a more diversified roster of suppliers, they could more easily shift production to countries that carried lower tariff rates. China’s share of U.S. imports — which slumped when Mr. Trump waged a trade war on the county in his first term — fell further last year. But U.S. imports from Mexico and Vietnam increased to help make up the difference. But many bigger companies stockpiled inventory before the tariffs took effect, allowing them to keep prices relatively stable. Some have also accepted smaller profit margins in the hopes that the Trump administration would reach more favorable trade deals eventually. For smaller businesses, tariffs have been a bigger drag . Many did not have the clout to arrange deals with foreign suppliers. Because they typically operate with smaller profit margins, they couldn’t swallow the additional expenses for long. Some had to raise prices on consumers or risk going under. Still, the impact of tariffs has been smaller than many economists anticipated, in part because many companies feared that raising prices would drive away customers. Tariffs have lifted prices on some imported goods, but for the most part, prices have not ballooned. Who bears the brunt of the tariffs could evolve. Many companies delayed some shipments as they worked through pre-tariff inventory, pushing off the tariffs’ costs and allowing them to defer some decisions about how to manage the additional duties. As stockpiles become depleted, avoidance will no longer be an option. The researchers at the New York Fed found that foreign suppliers started to bear a greater proportion of the tariff costs by the end of the year, likely as U.S. companies began renegotiating their contracts. Still, in November, 86 percent of the tariff cost was still passing through to the United States. Over the year, the average tariff rate on U.S. imports rose to 13 percent from 2.6 percent, the economists said, spiking in April and May as Mr. Trump applied tariffs to exports from foreign countries, including China. Their findings imply that, overall, U.S. import prices for goods rose 11 percent because of the tariffs. Ana Swanson covers trade and international economics for The Times and is based in Washington.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT President Trump’s seizure of Venezuela’s oil and his on-again, off-again vows to acquire Greenland , by force if necessary, have underscored the new threat that Washington poses to nations’ sovereignty. The land and resource grabs have alarmed even once-close allies, compelling them to consider other, less obvious risks. The most pointed stems from American dominance over the global financial networks and technology systems that undergird nearly every purchase or exchange of information made by citizens, businesses and governments. Allies are concerned for their financial independence and the security of confidential national data. The risks may be harder to visualize than crashing through a nation’s border and carting off its valuable crude. But they have revived efforts, particularly in Europe, to strengthen control over these critical, though unseen, sources of autonomy and power. European leaders have stepped up their push to reduce reliance on big American tech firms like Amazon, Google and Microsoft for cloud computing, and on financial services titans like Mastercard and Visa for payment systems. The move to secure what are being labeled monetary sovereignty and digital sovereignty is part of a broader effort to reduce Europe’s dependence on American weapons, trade, technology and more. At a summit in Belgium this week, President Emmanuel Macron of France warned that the reliance makes the continent more vulnerable to economic and political coercion from the White House, and he urged other European leaders to seize “the Greenland moment” to do something about it. Economists and bankers have also been urging lawmakers to approve the creation of a digital euro — the online version of cash — to lessen dependence on American financial service companies and networks. Image President Emmanuel Macron of France at a summit in Belgium, where he warned about Europe’s technological dependence. Credit... Virginia Mayo/Associated Press “Trump was elected and everyone started getting very, very scared,” said Dan Davies, formerly an economist at the Bank of England. Europeans woke up to Mr. Trump’s willingness to use their needs to squeeze Europe and realized “now this is obviously a national security issue.” Nearly two-thirds of the transactions in countries that use the euro, the second-most commonly used currency in global trade, were handled by Mastercard or Visa in 2025, according to the European Central Bank. And at least 13 European nations, including Austria, Spain and Ireland, have no nationally controlled option for in-store or online digital payments. The issue gained urgency as leaders began to consider that powerful tools that Washington once reserved for adversaries like Russia and Iran could be turned on them. The risk is rising that Europe could “lose control over the most fundamental element in our economy: our money,” 70 prominent economists and other experts wrote in a letter to the European Parliament last month. Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, has pointed to Mr. Trump’s decision to impose sanctions on judges and prosecutors at the International Criminal Court for investigating whether Israel committed war crimes in Gaza. Mr. Trump’s action effectively cut off their access to digital and financial services, including credit cards. And because the executive order barred U.S. companies from providing services to those listed, the chief prosecutor’s email account provided by Microsoft was turned off. Image Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, has warned that U.S. sanctions threaten Europe’s financial sovereignty. Credit... Frederick Florin/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The move set off shudders among government and security officials throughout Europe as an illustration of Mr. Trump’s quickness to leverage America’s financial and tech dominance to punish opponents even in allied countries. “That gives you one very specific example of how we are not effectively sovereign in our own garden,” Ms. Lagarde said in an interview with The Financial Times. The Trump administration’s embrace of stablecoins and cryptocurrencies has only ratcheted up concerns in the European Union about control of the euro. Worries about the integrity of sensitive and private information, too, are rising. Legislation passed by Congress in recent years, including changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and a law known as the CLOUD Act, gives the U.S. government additional powers to spy on foreigners’ communications without a warrant and to force American companies to hand over data from anywhere around the globe. Mr. Trump has also threatened the 27-member European Union with tariffs if it tries to regulate or tax American tech firms. The risk of “exposing our scientific exchanges, sensitive data and strategic innovations to non-European actors” prompted the French government to order all state workers to stop using the American-owned video platform Zoom and switch to a homegrown alternative, Visio. Municipalities in Germany, Denmark and France have also been shifting from American-owned systems to European or other alternatives. Image People came out in Copenhagen, Denmark, in January to protest President Trump’s threats over Greenland. Credit... Hilary Swift for The New York Times But there can be glitches. The Netherlands had hired Solvinity, a Dutch cloud company, to operate its national digital identity system. But in November, the firm announced an agreement to be acquired by the American multinational Kyndryl. European leaders have vowed to spend billions to build cloud computing infrastructure and develop artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Reducing dependence on American tech or financial services firms is easier said than done. The banking industry in Europe, which is developing private payment alternatives, has opposed a digital euro, and so have far-right political parties, citing concerns about privacy and economic centralization. As for digital technologies, at least 80 percent of Europe’s are imported, according to a recent report by European Digital SME Alliance, a trade group. In 2013, Europe controlled about 22 percent of the global market for information and communications technology. By 2022, it was only about 11 percent. Many European leaders see artificial intelligence as an area where Europe can thrive. But the region has fallen far behind the United States and China in building the most cutting-edge systems. In countries like Britain, Germany, Spain and Norway, many of the biggest A.I. projects are being spearheaded in partnership with American tech firms, which have vowed to spend hundreds of billions on new data centers and other infrastructure. “The computational divide has become a chasm,” warned a report published by Oxford University and other research groups. Microsoft, Apple and Google, which have major customer bases in Europe, have tried to reassure governments in the region that they can be trusted. Yet many have been left questioning how the companies would respond to national security orders made by the U.S. government. “If they are asked by the U.S. administration to hand over data, which can be sensitive data, they may not be in a position to say no,” said Andrea Renda, an expert on digital policy at CEPS, a think tank in Brussels, and an adviser to European Union officials. Constance de Leusse, executive director of the A.I. and Society Institute in France, said all involved might be hurt as the ties between important allies eroded. “The race to dominate by the U.S. and for autonomy on the European side may hurt everyone,” she said. “It feels like a losing game for both sides.” A correction was made on Feb. 12, 2026 : An earlier version of this article misstated the status of Kyndryl’s acquisition of Solvinity. An agreement was announced in November, but the acquisition is not yet complete. When we learn of a mistake, w",

Feb. 12, 2026 A popular knock on Orange County, Calif., is that it is a mass of indistinguishable neighborhoods designed for the efficient placement of tract homes. But a few miles down the highway from Disneyland, smack in center of the county, lies a subtle refutation of sprawl-style growth. The city is Irvine, population 300,000 or so. On the surface it looks like a typical American suburb with curlicue streets and shopping centers abundant in parking. What makes Irvine unique is that unlike most of its neighbors, it also has a dense base of employment that includes a university, manufacturing and high-rise office buildings — in other words, it is a true city. This happened fast, and not organically. Almost all of Irvine was built by a single entity, the Irvine Company, which for most of its 160-year history was a grain and citrus farming operation. The company started developing this farmland during California’s post-World War II boom, and in the late 1970s was taken over by a group of investors that included Donald Bren. (Bren, 93, is now the sole owner and one of the country’s richest people, thanks to Irvine’s growth.) The company planned most of Irvine’s parks, streets and structures, and it continues to own a majority of the city’s apartments, shopping centers and offices — even a local newspaper . Almost no place in America is more completely a company town. Image A single company planned most of Irvine’s parks, streets and structures. Credit... Matt Gush/Shutterstock As the country grapples with a housing shortage, Irvine’s model has gained a new appeal. What more efficient way to produce homes and expand businesses than building new urban areas on vacant land without the complexities of an existing city? Enticed by the potential profits and eager to have more control over their footprint, investors and businesses are backing new town and city concepts that, like Irvine, are guided by a private hand. Some of the plans are dead serious, others fanciful. Perhaps not surprisingly, their most enthusiastic proponents tend to be technology billionaires. Take, for instance, Starbase, Texas , a newly incorporated city that has clusters of employee housing built around manufacturing and launch facilities owned by SpaceX, Elon Musk’s rocket company. Starbase, which encompasses about 1.5 square miles near the Mexican border , is one of several attempts to use Texas’ abundant land and loose development laws to seed start-up communities with names like Proto-Town and Austantinople . Back in California, a group of Silicon Valley moguls are pursuing something much grander: a proposal to build a city of 400,000 people on top of rolling hills an hour north of San Francisco (at the moment those hills are occupied by sheep farms and wind turbines). California Forever, the company behind the project, has spent about $1 billion acquiring 70,000 acres of farmland and put forth a plan to build a walkable community with nearby manufacturing and shipbuilding facilities. There is, of course, a big difference between declaring an intent to build a whole city and doing it. In 2021, Marc Lore, the billionaire founder of the shopping portal Jet.com, announced Telosa, which is imagined as a desert city of five million people. Lore’s aim is to upend the economics of land use: A foundation would manage development and lease land to residents and businesses (who would own the buildings). Telosa has a small team of employees and consultants, and a website with animations of elevated trams cruising past pedestrian-friendly streets. It has also yet to acquire land, so, for now, is more utopian dream than real-life destination. These efforts might seem kooky if the drive for new cities wasn’t also getting purchase from influential policy minds. The economists Paul M. Romer , a Nobel laureate and professor at Boston College, and Edward L. Glaeser of Harvard have boosted the new city concept in the United States and abroad. At the same time, urbanists are organizing pop-up villages and designing car-lite and even car-free neighborhoods. About a year after the California Forever project was revealed , Devon Zuegel, a software engineer, announced a proposal for a new neighborhood in the Sonoma County city of Cloverdale. The project is called Esmeralda . Esmeralda, which borrows heavily from the new urbanist movement, is slated for a site where the city had earlier approved a golf course neighborhood dotted with large, single-family homes and ample yards. Zuegel’s hope is to execute a kind of planning U-turn. Esmeralda’s ambition is to build 605 higher-density homes with front porches and bike-friendly streets all linked to shops, offices and hotel rooms by walkways and a community plaza. Even the biggest of these projects is tiny compared with new city ideas in the rest of the world. There is nothing to match the scale and hubris of, say, Neom , the $500 billion city that Saudi Arabia hopes will diversify its oil-dependent economy, or the dozens of new cities in Asia whose stock of empty buildings makes them seem both impressive and like a good way to go broke. During his 2024 campaign, President Trump announced his intent to create “ Freedom Cities ” that would be constructed on federal land and “reignite American imagination” by embracing innovations like flying vehicles that take off and land vertically. But as president, he has not offered much of a blueprint, and has instead mostly pushed ideas to allow prospective home buyers to take on more debt . However it happens, America needs more housing. Economists estimate the current shortage at somewhere between four million and seven million units, which would take several decades to build at the current pace of construction. The easiest way to boost those numbers is to build more housing on the urban edge, where land and construction are less expensive. The unifying thesis of projects like California Forever and Esmeralda is to use the logic of sprawl-style growth — build on undeveloped land outside city centers — to create neighborhoods that aim to minimize the use of cars. “When I look around America and I see what’s being built, I have a hard time finding places I want to live,” said Zuegel, the chief executive of Esmeralda. “I’m not thrilled about the idea of raising kids in a city like San Francisco, where it would be hard to have independence at a young age. At the same time, I don’t want to live in a car-centric suburb where you can’t walk to a store.” Open land represents the future in its purest form — after all, every place was no place at some point. The quest for resources, escaping bondage or seeking places to worship freely have all motivated new settlements and fresh modes of living. Buildings, sure, but also a chance to improve society in a place where the future looms larger than the past. “We are trying to create a place that will someday have all the messiness and complexity that real cities have,” said Gabriel Metcalf, the head of planning for California Forever. “The word ‘city’ is an expression of that ambition.” But every idea needs a model. And in the United States, it’s hard to find a more successful one than Irvine. A City Built From Scratch The weekday drive from Los Angeles to Orange County is choked with traffic and rimmed by strip malls. On a recent morning, I made the slog to meet Michael Stockstill, a former employee of the Irvine Company and co-author (with H. Pike Oliver) of “Transforming the Irvine Ranch,” the definitive history of Irvine and its post-World War II transformation. Over the next few hours, Stockstill drove me around while narrating the city’s history. Calling my attention to the absence of billboards",

The U.S. economy put in a strong showing at the start of 2026, following a year of disruptions that depressed both the demand for labor and its supply. Employers added 130,000 jobs in January, the Labor Department reported on Wednesday, in a report delayed from last week by a short government shutdown. The unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent from 4.4 percent a month earlier. The peppier-than-expected data is a sign that the labor market might be emerging from a period of extremely slow growth brought on by a trade war that made companies hesitant to hire, an immigration crackdown that lowered the number of available workers and a federal government firing spree. Annual revisions to earlier data changed the picture of last year. The economy added only 181,000 jobs in 2025, down from an earlier estimate of 584,000. Here’s what else to know: More people working: The labor force participation rate for people in their prime working years, between 25 and 54, jumped to 84.1 percent. That is as high as it’s been since 2001. Narrow growth: As has been the case for more than a year, health care accounted for more than half of job gains in January, adding 82,000 positions. Construction gained 33,000 jobs, but most other sectors were flat, and the federal government shed another 35,000 positions. Working longer: In another sign of strong labor demand, the average workweek edged up by 0.1 hours. That number has been depressed for months, as employers tried to keep people busy even with fewer orders. Wages up: Average hourly earnings rose by 3.7 percent over the year, a pace that has been fairly consistent in recent months. However, that growth has become more stratified, with those on the higher end of the income ladder seeing faster raises . Slow hiring, slower layoffs: Other federal data released last week showed that job openings dropped to 6.5 million in December, the lowest level since September 2020. At the same time, initial claims for unemployment insurance remained very low in January, suggesting that employers are not laying off more people than usual. A seasonal quirk: Sluggish hiring of seasonal workers during the holidays may have boosted the number. If fewer were laid off in January, that would translate into a stronger reading after the Bureau of Labor Statistics adjusts for typical seasonal fluctuations. The Fed has time: The February jobs report is slated to be released before the Federal Reserve meets next to set interest rates, in mid-March. That is, unless another government shutdown delays the report again.

U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield Feb. 11, 2026, 10:20 a.m. ET Talmon Joseph Smith A good zoomed out piece of perspective from Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, as number-crunching takes from today’s numbers filter in. “Once one works through the large downward revisions it does appear that following Fed rate cuts in the second half of 2025 that hiring stabilized, albeit at a modest pace of 73,000 over the previous three months including the January 2026 estimate,” Mr. Brusuelas said. “On a six-month basis one can see the slower pace of hiring, which averaged 15,000 per month.” Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Feb. 11, 2026, 10:04 a.m. ET Tony Romm President Trump seized on the jobs report Wednesday to renew his call for lower interest rates. In a post on social media, he described the monthly figure as “FAR GREATER THAN EXPECTED!” before insisting that the United States should “be paying the LOWEST INTEREST RATE, by far.” The president did not address the other key component in today’s release — a steep downward revision to hiring estimates from previous months. An earlier revision prompted Mr. Trump to order the firing of the top official overseeing the labor statistics agency that produces the monthly jobs report. Feb. 11, 2026, 9:50 a.m. ET Talmon Joseph Smith “A year ago, this would have been considered a ‘meh’ employment report. In the current environment, 130,000 print is a blowout number,” said said Samuel Rines, an economist and a macro strategist at WisdomTree, a financial firm. “Sure, there was a significant revision to jobs growth in 2025. But that doesn’t really matter. That already happened and doesn’t tell us much about the current environment. For all the angst about the outlook for 2026, this should mitigate some of it.” Feb. 11, 2026, 9:51 a.m. ET Talmon Joseph Smith The only thing I would add to that reaction is that economists, including Mr. Rines, acknowledge that January is one of the noisier job reports because of the trickiness of making seasonal adjustments to payroll estimates right after the holidays. We’ll get more signal about the underlying trend in the coming months. Feb. 11, 2026, 9:35 a.m. ET Joe Rennison The S&P 500 opened 0.5 percent higher as trading got underway on Wall Street. Energy stocks led the rise, followed by industrials and then technology stocks. S&P 500 Feb. 11, 2026, 9:33 a.m. ET Joe Rennison “Markets may have been expecting a downshift in today’s numbers after last week’s soft data, but the jobs market hit the gas pedal instead,” said Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, adding that the data supported the Fed’s earlier decision not to lower interest rates. “Today’s data shows an acceleration in employment that was strong enough to drive unemployment lower—vindication for Chair Powell’s holding pattern.” Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Feb. 11, 2026, 9:28 a.m. ET Talmon Joseph Smith Matt Bush, an economist at Guggenheim Investments, noted that, “Today’s downward revisions to last year’s job numbers imply that productivity in 2025 was maybe even stronger than we realized and may be revised up.” It can sound somewhat counterintuitive, because the reduced job gains are a disappointment, but productivity is a function of business output per hour. And, for now, it appears U.S. businesses have been able to produce even more output, while adding far fewer workers than usual. Feb. 11, 2026, 9:12 a.m. ET Tony Romm In a series of posts on social media, the White House Council of Economic Advisers heralded the jobs report for coming in “FAR above expectations” this month. It specifically pointed to the growth in private-sector jobs, and the decrease in government jobs, in January and over the past year. But the White House posts didn’t mention the revision that sharply lowered job growth estimates in previous months. 🚨Jobs Day Data Dump🚨 — Council of Economic Advisers (@CEA47) February 11, 2026 Feb. 11, 2026, 9:07 a.m. ET Talmon Joseph Smith “All the details of the report point to strength across the board, said Matt Bush, U.S. economist at Guggenheim Investments. “Real income for consumers is still positive, even if it’s weaker than before, so we think this can continue.” Feb. 11, 2026, 8:58 a.m. ET Sydney Ember The federal government lost 34,000 jobs in January, as the Trump administration’s efforts to slash the federal workforce continued.

Annual revisions to earlier data changed the picture of last year. The economy added only 181,000 jobs in 2025, down from an earlier estimate of 584,000. Here’s what else to know: More people working: The labor force participation rate for people in their prime working years, between 25 and 54, jumped to 84.1 percent. That is as high as it’s been since 2001. Narrow growth: As has been the case for more than a year, health care accounted for more than half of job gains in January, adding 82,000 positions. Construction gained 33,000 jobs, but most other sectors were flat, and the federal government shed another 35,000 positions. Working longer: In another sign of strong labor demand, the average workweek edged up by 0.1 hours. That number has been depressed for months, as employers tried to keep people busy even with fewer orders. Wages up: Average hourly earnings rose by 3.7 percent over the year, a pace that has been fairly consistent in recent months. However, that growth has become more stratified, with those on the higher end of the income ladder seeing faster raises . Slow hiring, slower layoffs: Other federal data released last week showed that job openings dropped to 6.5 million in December, the lowest level since September 2020. At the same time, initial claims for unemployment insurance remained very low in January, suggesting that employers are not laying off more people than usual. A seasonal quirk: Sluggish hiring of seasonal workers during the holidays may have boosted the number. If fewer were laid off in January, that would translate into a stronger reading after the Bureau of Labor Statistics adjusts for typical seasonal fluctuations. The Fed has time: The February jobs report is slated to be released before the Federal Reserve meets next to set interest rates, in mid-March. That is, unless another government shutdown delays the report again.

In a post on social media, he described the monthly figure as “FAR GREATER THAN EXPECTED!” before insisting that the United States should “be paying the LOWEST INTEREST RATE, by far.” The president did not address the other key component in today’s release — a steep downward revision to hiring estimates from previous months. An earlier revision prompted Mr. Trump to order the firing of the top official overseeing the labor statistics agency that produces the monthly jobs report. Feb. 11, 2026, 9:50 a.m. ET Talmon Joseph Smith “A year ago, this would have been considered a ‘meh’ employment report. In the current environment, 130,000 print is a blowout number,” said said Samuel Rines, an economist and a macro strategist at WisdomTree, a financial firm. “Sure, there was a significant revision to jobs growth in 2025. But that doesn’t really matter. That already happened and doesn’t tell us much about the current environment. For all the angst about the outlook for 2026, this should mitigate some of it.” Feb. 11, 2026, 9:51 a.m. ET Talmon Joseph Smith The only thing I would add to that reaction is that economists, including Mr. Rines, acknowledge that January is one of the noisier job reports because of the trickiness of making seasonal adjustments to payroll estimates right after the holidays.

And, for now, it appears U.S. businesses have been able to produce even more output, while adding far fewer workers than usual.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The U.S. economy is growing, but not evenly. What began as an uneven rebound from the Covid-19 pandemic has hardened into what many economists describe as a “K-shaped” economy , in which higher-income households pull ahead while lower-income households fall further behind . High interest rates, rising costs and the rapid growth of artificial intelligence could deepen those divides, economists warn. “We are returning to a typical pattern of extremely high income inequality, and it now stands at a 60-year peak,” Beth Ann Bovino, chief economist at U.S. Bank, wrote in a recent report . “The worry is not just where we stand now, but also whether ongoing developments will worsen the situation.” The net worth of the top 1 percent of households climbed to a record share of nearly 32 percent of the national total in the third quarter of 2025, according to data from the Federal Reserve , which started tracking household wealth in 1989. Spending patterns have also split: Households earning under $75,000 a year are spending less on discretionary categories like travel and experiences than they did in 2019, while those making more than $150,000 are spending more, according to Bank of America Institute . Retail sales softened in December, data released on Tuesday showed, weighed down by a slight drop in purchases of vehicles and food. More executives are acknowledging the divide and its effects on their business. Delta Air Lines said in October that ticket sales for premium seats were expected to outpace those in the main cabin. The snack maker Mondelez said this month that consumers were “worried about overall affordability” and pulling back on snacking or shifting to value-store brands. “They are fed up with the price increases — they don’t feel good about their personal economic outlook,” Dirk Van de Put, chief executive of Mondelez, said during an earnings call. “And as a consequence, snacking is being affected.” Here is what some other companies have said about prices, spending and how the “K-shaped” economy is affecting their businesses: Chipotle: The fast-food chain is aiming to increase foot traffic and revenue amid weak comparable sales by focusing on higher-income consumers — a segment the company recently identified as its core audience, with 60 percent of customers from households earning above $100,000 on average. Clorox: The cleaning brand is adjusting pricing and product sizes to respond to pressure on all consumers but especially lower-income customers, Linda Rendle, the company’s chief executive, said on an earnings call this month. Clorox said shoppers were trading down to smaller packages at dollar stores or buying in bulk at club stores. Yum Brands: During its latest earnings call this month, Yum Brands, which owns Taco Bell and KFC, reported transaction growth across all income levels, with particularly notable gains among higher-income consumers in the last quarter. PayPal: The online payment company announced that it would no longer commit to the specific 2027 outlook presented at last year’s investor day. Instead, it plans to provide forecasts one year at a time, citing the influence of “macro factors and a K-shaped economy,” Jamie Miller, the company’s interim chief executive, said in a conference call this month. McDonald’s: The fast-food chain revived its “Extra Value Meal” combos as traffic from lower-income customers declined while visits from higher-income customers rose double digits. Chris Kempczinski, its chief executive, described the trend as a “two-tier economy.” Coca-Cola: The beverage company said in October that sales growth had been driven by higher-income consumers buying premium brands, while middle- and lower-income shoppers remain under pressure and more focused on value.

A crowd of anonymous online gamblers placing bets on Kalshi, a prediction site, expected to see 54,000 new jobs. The report ended up showing the U.S. economy had added 130,000 jobs at the start of the year. Both groups had missed the mark by a wide margin — and to similar degrees. Over the five years that Kalshi has existed , its thousands of gamblers have proved as accurate on average at predicting certain economic indicators as the highly trained forecasters, a working paper published last month by the National Bureau of Economic Research found. The crowd is also pretty good at predicting interest rate decisions from the Federal Reserve, and even better than the professionals at predicting the rate of inflation . “Getting information from a large pool of people can be a remarkably good form of forecasting,” said Jonathan Wright, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University who co-wrote the paper. Thomas Simons, a U.S. economist with Jefferies, the investment firm, took notice when Kevin Warsh was leading in the prediction markets to be President Trump’s nominee for chair of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Simons had dismissed the possibility because of Mr. Warsh’s past advocacy for higher interest rates , rather than the lower rates that Mr. Trump prefers. “‘How could it possibly be that he’s at the head of this? It doesn’t make any sense,’” Mr. Simons recalled thinking. But the markets turned out to be right , and he decided he shouldn’t disregard the odds. Bettors, he realized, have one advantage: They don’t have to make a prediction if they’re not highly confident that they’re right. Professional forecasters don’t have a choice; even if the data are confusing and they don’t have much conviction in the number, they guess. “You have to forecast these numbers every month even when you don’t necessarily think you have some kind of edge,” Mr. Simons said. “So it starts to make me feel like, if I go back to my priors on this, the people who have edge are the ones who are going to participate.” Another working paper , by economists at the London Business School and Yale University, found that Polymarket bettors as a whole forecast corporate earnings more accurately than the analysts who are paid to advise investors on whether to buy or sell. Theis Jensen, a Yale professor who worked on the paper, thinks the comparatively good performance by thousands of amateurs can be chalked up to incentives. Professional analysts may have conflicts of interest, such as their firm’s trading commissions, which might rise in response to rosier forecasts. Analysts may also avoid publishing earnings forecasts that are out of the norm, which can lead to more embarrassment than sticking with the crowd. “The nice thing about prediction markets is that you have to put your money where your mouth is,” Mr. Jensen said, “and so that highly incentivizes you to state your true beliefs.” Of course, that has been true for decades. The first online prediction markets emerged in the early 2000s. Sites like Intrade focused mostly on elections and the likelihood of other world events, and were generally found to be fairly accurate. In the 2010s, U.S. regulators cracked down, ruling that they were operating as illegal gambling platforms. But some platforms continued to operate in Europe, where political and economic contracts are a sideshow to enormous volumes of sports betting. The same is still true of Kalshi , which won a lawsuit allowing it to operate legally in 2024, and Polymarket , which is only sporadically accessible in the United States as lawsuits have blocked trading in many states. And yet betting volume even on nonsports questions has expanded at such a torrid pace that forecasters and analysts are taking notice. On any given day, more than $60 million is at stake on the platforms on political and economic questions — far more than the earlier platforms reached. Edward Ridgely runs Stand, a company that allows bettors to trade simultaneously on Kalshi and Polymarket and follow other large traders. He said many of his highest-volume customers worked in the same fields where they wagered. One user in Hong Kong buys and sells Nvidia stock in his day job and uses the tariff-related prediction market contracts as a hedge. “If the Trump tariffs escalate toward China or something, he can get out of his position and not get blown away,” Mr. Ridgely said. He sees another piece of evidence that bettors specialize: Most of them aren’t good at everything. “You can see that a lot of the traders who are really good at elections aren’t very good at crypto. Or if you’re really good at crypto, you’re not very good at geopolitics,” he said. Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist of J.P. Morgan, has access to a deep well of expertise from the bank’s political affairs staff, country specialists and equity researchers. But he still looks at the markets to get a more precise estimate. “Whenever you talk to D.C. people, they’ll say, ‘Well, I think they’ll get the budget done.’ So, what’s the probability?” Mr. Feroli said. “It’s a different language. Oftentimes you’ve got to really push to get a quantitative answer.” On the quantitative questions that are his stock in trade, like forecasting changes to the Consumer Price Index and gross domestic product, Mr. Feroli suspects something else is going on: The betting markets are just following the experts. That could mean monitoring the Bloomberg consensus, reading research from the big investment houses or tracking the futures markets and investor expectations that groups like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange already aggregate. Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University who studies forecasting, agrees that is likely. And therein lies a danger in prediction markets: If the crowd were to supplant professional forecasters, individual bettors would lose out. “They would be making the jobs of their contributors harder, because now they have individual sources of information to draw from,” Ms. Sinclair said. “If they replace all of that, then they won’t have those to also go to.” Most forecasters aren’t worried about that, because they do more than predict numbers. Every estimate comes with a detailed analysis of the factors underneath the headline number, which is what investors and companies need to figure out how to spend money. “Surprises happen, and people want to know, ‘What does this mean, what’s going to happen, what’s driving it?’” said Michael Pugliese, a U.S. economist with Wells Fargo. “I think that’s a lot of nuanced, important information that you’d want to have when you are making decisions, as an operator in these markets.” But prediction markets could become an input for some complex forecasts, like those constructed by the Federal Reserve. Justin Wolfers, an economics professor at the University of Michigan who studied and wrote about the earlier iterations of prediction markets, has told Fed officials that they should take those markets into consideration. They have been hesitant, he said. “There’s a deep problem, which is, if you were to do this, you democratize decision making,” Mr. Wolfers said. “Right now the senior economist has a ton of power. Their view goes.” It may also be true that neither individual experts nor a collective of thousands are the best at predicting the future. Over the past decade, a group called Good Judgment has developed a model of selecting people with good track records of figuring out what will happen. These “superforecasters” are applied to longer-range questions of interest to paying clients. They work collaboratively, but u",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Strong monthly jobs growth and easing unemployment have pushed back expectations about when the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates again, suggesting the central bank is poised for an extended pause. Data released on Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed monthly jobs growth of 130,000 positions, almost double what economists had forecast, and the unemployment rate ticking down to 4.3 percent. That is down from a recent peak of 4.5 percent in January and slightly lower than December’s level. The unemployment rate has become a focal point for the Fed as it assesses the health of the labor market in the wake of immigration restrictions imposed by President Trump. The crackdown, which has led to a sharp slowdown of migration into the country, has decreased the supply of new workers available for hire. The number of new jobs the economy needs to keep the unemployment rate stable has dropped as a result, with research suggesting it could turn negative by this year. In 2024, the so-called monthly break-even rate was estimated to be well above 100,000 positions. Financial markets shifted sharply on Wednesday after the jobs report was released, with traders pushing back the timing of the next cut to July from June. “The window to see a material weakening in the labor market is probably closing,” said Stephen Juneau, an economist at Bank of America. “It seems like we have more momentum building in the economy rather than the reverse of that.” The Fed is trying to safeguard the labor market while also ensuring that rates are high enough for inflation to fall back to the central bank’s target of 2 percent. Price pressures have mounted as Mr. Trump’s tariffs have taken effect, although the overall impact has been more muted than initially expected. Officials at the Fed broadly expect the peak impact from those levies to hit in the first quarter of this year before inflation begins to decelerate again. January’s Consumer Price Index report, set to be released on Friday, will give policymakers insight into whether that forecast is bearing out. Economists expect annual inflation to tick down to 2.5 percent after a 0.3 percent increase in monthly prices. “Core” inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy items, is expected to stay sticky at 2.5 percent, only slightly lower than the previous 2.6 percent annual pace. But in a sign that labor-related price pressures remain muted, the employment cost index, a quarterly measure from the Labor Department that tracks changes in wages and benefits, unexpectedly slowed in the final three months of 2025. Economists at Evercore ISI said that data, which came out on Tuesday, confirmed their view that the “economy is cooling under the hood, even though we face up to another six months of elevated tariff pass-through.” Beyond the impact of tariffs, the Fed is also contending with the prospects of stronger growth in the coming quarters as Americans receive larger refunds as a result of Mr. Trump’s new tax cuts. The ongoing boom in artificial intelligence investments is also expected to fuel economic growth. Bank of America’s Mr. Juneau described the tax refunds as a “jolt for consumption over the next few months.” He said that, coupled with a likely easing of trade uncertainty ahead of the midterms, could imbue companies with the confidence to hire and invest more in the economy. “This year, with the midterms, you’re not going to see tariffs really ratcheted up again,” he said. At the Fed’s meeting just last month , Jerome H. Powell, the chair, struck a more upbeat tone about the economic outlook. He described the labor market as “stabilizing” after a period of weakness last year and noted that consumer spending and business fixed investment remained strong, even as Americans had grown less confident about the economy. “The economy has once again surprised us with its strength, not for the first time,” Mr. Powell said. That shift helped to justify the central bank’s decision at that meeting to pause rate cuts after a series of reductions last year. Between September and December, the Fed lowered rates by an aggregate three-quarters of a percentage point to a range of 3.5 percent to 3.75 percent. By the December meeting, the Fed’s policy decisions had become increasingly fraught, reflecting a fissure between policymakers over how to weigh concerns about the labor market versus inflation. Those divisions have lessened, but even January’s vote to hold rates steady was not unanimous. Stephen I. Miran, who has dissented at every meeting since he joined the Fed in September, voted in favor of a quarter-point cut. He was joined by Christopher J. Waller, a governor who was a finalist to replace Mr. Powell as chair when his term is up in May. A few days after that meeting, Mr. Trump tapped Kevin M. Warsh , a former Fed governor, for the job. In explaining his dissent, Mr. Waller said that revisions to the jobs data would likely show no growth in employment last year. “Zero. Zip. Nada,” Mr. Waller said in a statement. “This does not remotely look like a healthy labor market.” Further cuts appear to hinge on the labor market breaking out of its current “low hire, low fire” state and layoffs beginning to pick up in a more broad-based way, or inflation significantly slowing. Mr. Powell last month stopped short of signaling any timeline for future moves, reiterating that the central bank is “well positioned” for the moment and to address any economic challenges. He did, however, downplay the possibility of a rate increase this year. “We don’t take things off the table, but it isn’t anybody’s base case right now,” Mr. Powell said. Traders still expect rates to fall toward 3 percent by year-end, but to get there more slowly than before. Many officials believe that 3 percent rates would shift policy to a “neutral\" setting that neither stimulates nor restricts growth. Mr. Trump, who said his support of Mr. Warsh was contingent on his pushing for lower borrowing costs, has argued for rates to be closer to 1 percent. In a social media post on Wednesday after January’s report was released, the president again called for the country to be paying the lowest interest rate in the world and said it would lead to cost savings of at least $1 trillion a year related to payments to service the national debt. But the Fed does not take into consideration interest payments on the debt when setting policy. It is congressionally mandated to pursue low, stable inflation and a healthy labor market. “If you’re somewhat in the neutral camp and inflation is above target, then it’s harder for them to make the case to cut,” Priya Misra, a portfolio manager at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said of the Fed. “They need a clear emergency message from the labor market.” Colby Smith covers the Federal Reserve and the U.S. economy for The Times.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Job growth over the past two years was far weaker than previously believed. U.S. employers added just 181,000 jobs last year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Wednesday. That was 69 percent fewer jobs than its initial estimate of 584,000. The agency also lowered its estimate of job growth in 2024 by nearly 28 percent. In total, the U.S. economy has more than a million fewer jobs than previously reported. The revisions are part of a longstanding annual process in which the B.L.S. reconciles its monthly estimates of job growth, which are derived from surveys, with less timely but more reliable data from state governments. In the past, the so-called benchmark revisions have typically been small and attracted relatively little attention. But the 2024 adjustment was the biggest in years, reducing estimated job growth by nearly 600,000. This year’s revision was even bigger, the largest since 2009 in percentage terms. The new data makes even more pronounced the “low hire, low fire” stasis that has characterized the labor market for much of the past two years. The revisions didn’t affect the unemployment rate, which ticked down to 4.3 percent in January. But they suggest that job growth ground nearly to a halt last year, making it hard for anyone without a job to find one. “We’ve been hearing from workers that the job market is not working for them for some time,” said Daniel Zhao, chief economist at the employment site Glassdoor. “The anecdotes are starting to align with the data.” The revisions also underscore how dependent the job market has become on hiring in the health care sector . Before the revisions, health care accounted for about 405,000 of the 584,000 jobs added in 2025, or nearly 70 percent of the gains. According to the latest data, health care companies added 391,000 jobs, while employment in other sectors fell by a combined 210,000 jobs. “That really puts into sharp relief how poorly other industries are doing even as health care continues to grow,” Mr. Zhao said. The consecutive large revisions have led some economists to question the reliability of the survey-based monthly estimates. In December, Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, said economists at the central bank estimated that the B.L.S. had been overstating employment gains by about 60,000 jobs per month — a figure that, if accurate, would suggest that employers were cutting payrolls for much of last year. The revisions have become a political issue. President Trump pointed to the previous big adjustment when he fired Erika McEntarfer, the head of the statistical agency, last summer, saying it showed she was incompetent and biased against him. Experts across the ideological spectrum rejected those accusations, noting that there was no consistent political pattern in the revisions. Rather, they said, the large revisions highlighted the challenge of accurately measuring the economy during a period of falling survey response rates and changing employment patterns. Those challenges have been exacerbated by budget cuts and staff turnover, problems that predated Mr. Trump but have grown worse since he returned to office. “I think we need to be more skeptical” about the monthly employment estimates, said Guy Berger, a labor economist who follows the numbers closely. He said he remained confident that the estimates were free from political bias. But the large revisions suggest the B.L.S. is struggling to get an accurate read on the state of the labor market. “You can trust that folks are trying to measure this accurately,” he said. But, he added, “I don’t think you can put a lot of weight on the specific monthly numbers.” But Jed Kolko, an economist who oversaw economic data at the Commerce Department during the Biden administration, said the statistical agencies had faced a particularly challenging period in recent years. “Revisions tend to be bigger when the economy is changing rapidly,” he wrote in an email. “Job growth has been unusually volatile for several years, first from the pandemic and then from the immigration surge, so revisions in recent years have been bigger.” One possible — though partial — explanation for the recent downward revisions relates to the way government statistics account for jobs created by newly started companies and destroyed by ones that go out of business. Such employers aren’t included in the monthly jobs survey, so the B.L.S. estimates their impact based on historical patterns, using a statistical method known as the “birth-death model.” That approach can’t always keep up with changes in the economy, however. During the coronavirus pandemic, Americans started new businesses in record numbers. More recently, job gains at new businesses have slowed. But it can take time for such shifts to show up in economic models. The B.L.S. said last year that it would change the birth-death model to be more responsive to shifts in the labor market. That should lead to smaller revisions in the future. But it could also make the initial monthly estimates more volatile and harder to interpret. The birth-death model accounted for only a fraction of the big revisions in 2024 and 2025, however. That suggests the updated method won’t fully resolve the recent issues with the monthly estimates. Doubts about the government’s data have led some economists in recent months to give renewed attention to alternative estimates from private sources such as ADP, the payroll processor. But those sources are less comprehensive than the official statistics, and often rely on government data to calibrate their models. Private data isn’t immune from revisions of its own. ADP last week updated its job estimates to align them with government data, a process similar to the B.L.S.’s annual benchmarking procedure. The revision reduced ADP’s estimate of private-sector job growth in 2025 by more than a third, and made substantial changes to the company’s figures as far back as 2020.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The U.S. economy put in a strong showing at the start of 2026, following a year of disruptions that depressed both the demand for labor and its supply. Employers added 130,000 jobs in January, the Labor Department reported on Wednesday, in a release delayed from last week by a short government shutdown. The unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent from 4.4 percent a month earlier. The peppier-than-expected reading is a sign that the labor market might be emerging from a period of extremely slow hiring brought on by a trade war that made companies hesitant to hire, an immigration crackdown that lowered the number of available workers and a federal government firing spree. Annual revisions to earlier data, which are routine but have been larger than usual in recent years, darkened the picture of 2025. The economy added only 181,000 jobs last year, down from an earlier estimate of 584,000. Not counting the pandemic year of 2020, that is the slowest pace since 2010, the midst of the Great Recession. “The revised numbers tell a more accurate story of what people were experiencing, which was really, really, really slow job growth and stagnation on a pretty major scale,” said Nicole Bachaud, a labor economist with the job search website ZipRecruiter. For perspective, the economy added nearly as many jobs last month alone than the entire gain during all of 2025. “This is giving a glimpse of what might be a turning point for the market as stabilization is taking place,” Ms. Bachaud said. “This is a pretty significant shift.” It’s too soon to tell if the January numbers represent a real acceleration. The numbers may have been flattered by a seasonal quirk: Retailers hired many fewer seasonal workers than usual over the holidays. If fewer were laid off in January, that would translate into a stronger reading after the Bureau of Labor Statistics adjusts for typical seasonal fluctuations. The end of last year saw the lowest number of job openings since late 2017, and since last July there have been more unemployed people than there are jobs available for them. Measures of consumer sentiment have been downbeat — the Conference Board’s index of whether workers see jobs as easy or hard to find was as pessimistic in December as it’s been since early 2021, when the economy was still emerging from the pandemic. But there is some evidence that the labor market may be grinding back into gear. Gross domestic product growth has been very strong, which could allow companies to make more investments that in turn increase their demand for labor. Surveys of manufacturers have been trending more optimistic, following two years of job losses and lackluster output. A broader measure of unemployment , which includes people working part time who would rather have more hours, dropped back to where it was last summer. Companies are also expecting a boost from lower taxes and deregulation this year, as well as potentially lower interest rates if the White House stops raising tariffs and inflation recedes further. “You’re hearing, ‘last year was pretty good all things considered, we survived the Trump tornado, and 2026 is looking all right, too,’” said Andrew Zatlin, managing director of SouthBay Research. “If I’m making all this money now, odds are the first quarter will also be super good.” President Trump celebrated the stronger-than-expected employment report on social media Wednesday morning and again called for lower interest rates. The Federal Reserve will see one more jobs report before it meets again in mid-March, but generally a falling unemployment rate is not seen as an argument for lowering borrowing costs, which tend to stimulate hiring. In fact, investors moved their expectations for the next rate cut to July from June after the jobs report was released. It is not clear that the U.S. economy will be able to sustain this pace of growth. Part of the reason for the slow hiring last year was that the Trump administration clamped down on immigration and ramped up deportations. That helped keep the unemployment rate from rising drastically even as job creation slowed, since fewer people were looking for work . January brought a good sign for labor supply. The share of people in their prime working years who are either employed or looking for a job reached 84.1 percent, the highest level since 2001. Still, the labor force is projected to flatline if immigration remains depressed. One thing hasn’t changed from last year : Job growth continues to be dominated by health care, which packed on 82,000 jobs in January. Construction added another 33,000, mostly among the specialty trade contractors that have been very busy building data centers. The federal government lost another 34,000 jobs and is down by 10.9 percent since reaching a peak in October 2024. “Health care has been carrying the load for the past couple of years in the private sector,” said Augustine Faucher, chief economist with PNC Financial Services Group. “I am concerned about the breadth of job growth, and the question is, how long can the economy continue to go with basically only health care adding jobs?” In recent months, several companies have made news by saying that investing in artificial intelligence allowed them to lay off thousands of workers. It is true that some of the fields that have been adopting A.I. fastest — such as information and professional and business services — have been shedding jobs. That is also partly because those fields hired much more quickly during the pandemic years, and have been going through a correction. However, A.I. may be finding its way into the labor market in more subtle ways. Eric Hagopian is the chief executive of Pilot Precision Products, a Massachusetts-based manufacturer and wholesaler of cutting tools that employs 35 people. He says that he’s been able to avoid hiring another customer service employee by adding an A.I.-powered agent to his website, and he hopes to augment more of his office staff in similar ways. “We have an accounts receivable manager, but she could do a lot more if she had someone doing all the matching of the invoice numbers to the bank statements, all those menial type things,” Mr. Hagopian said. People actually making things, however, are harder to automate. “You’re not going to replace people, ever, on the shop floor.” Mr. Hagopian thinks that leaning into A.I. will increase productivity, allowing him to pay his workers more. Wage growth has remained strong; average hourly earnings for private sector workers rose 3.7 percent since this time last year, a pace that’s been fairly consistent for the past year and a half. The workweek also lengthened slightly, which will put more money in workers’ pockets. Few analysts expect a strong rebound in manufacturing, which has shed 313,000 jobs over the past two years. But there are signs it could be finding its footing. “I think we’re seeing a manufacturing environment that’s going to start to stabilize,” said Stephanie Roth, chief economist with Wolfe Research. “You tend to need to have a proper recession to have a real early cycle environment, but this could be like the mid-1990s, where you get a bit of a reset.” Lydia DePillis reports on the American economy for The Times.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT President Trump campaigned on a platform of climate denial and a promise to reverse federal policies aimed at protecting the planet. But even experts have been stunned at the magnitude of the environmental protections he has unraveled and the speed with which his administration has acted. As Maxine Joselow and I report , the swift and meticulous dismantling of climate rules we are now seeing did not happen by chance. It was set in motion by a cadre of conservative lawyers who served in the first Trump administration and spent years honing arguments to block government regulations of climate pollution. We told the stories of four key players. Russell T. Vought and Jeffrey B. Clark, both high-profile allies of Trump, drafted executive orders. Mandy Gunasekara and Jonathan Brightbill, two conservative attorneys with long histories of fighting climate policies, collected what they called an “arsenal of information” to undermine the scientific and legal consensus that the planet is dangerously warming and the United States must take action. Both independently and in tandem, the four activists spent the Biden administration years charting roadmaps that a future Republican president could use to undermine established climate science and legally support the repeal of environmental rules. Those plans included Project 2025, a set of conservative policy recommendations for a second Trump term. A key climate rule Their biggest victory is around the corner. This week, the Environmental Protection Agency is expected to overturn what is known as the “endangerment finding,” a 2009 scientific determination that climate change threatens public health and welfare. By doing so, the federal government will effectively be relinquishing its authority to regulate the emissions that are dangerously warming the planet. Even more consequentially, reversing the endangerment finding could make it harder for a future administration to reverse course and curb emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other chemicals from automobile tailpipes and factory or power plant smokestacks. Vought, Clark, Gunasekara and Brightbill were not the only ones who pushed to repeal the endangerment finding. But documents obtained by Fieldnotes, a watchdog group, and reviewed by The New York Times, together with interviews with more than a dozen people show the four activists were the key strategists who sought to ensure that if Trump were re-elected, he could move rapidly and with minimal interference from civil servants. “We are pretty close to total victory,” Myron Ebell, a prominent critic of climate science, told us. Funding the fight Gunasekara and Brightbill sought $2 million to draft regulatory documents that a future administration could use to abandon the endangerment finding. The duo also planned to solicit white papers from scientists who did not accept the physics of climate change, according to a funding pitch for the project. The Heritage Foundation eventually agreed to fund some of this work, according to two people familiar with the matter. Clark has been fighting climate protections since 2005, when as a Justice Department lawyer in the George W. Bush administration he argued that the E.P.A. lacked the power to regulate greenhouse gases. He served as an assistant attorney general focusing on environmental deregulation during Trump’s first term. During the Biden administration Clark found a professional home with Vought, also a former Trump official. Vought had launched a think tanks, the Center for Renewing America, to keep the MAGA movement alive, and Clark drafted executive orders that a future president could use to swiftly scrap climate policies enacted by President Joseph R. Biden, according to two people familiar with the matter. Business groups initially fought the endangerment finding. But after years of lost legal challenges and public pressure to address climate change, most gave up. By 2017, when Trump first took office, hundreds of American companies, including oil giants and major manufacturers, had accepted the reality of climate change. Neil Chatterjee, a Republican who led the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the first Trump administration, told me it was the “pure ideological activists who believe that climate change is a hoax” who kept up the fight. And when Trump won the presidential race in 2024, they knew they’d have a willing partner in the White House. “They had the experience of being in Trump 1.0, seeing what they wanted to do, then got organized during the Biden years,” Chatterjee said, adding that they “used their time in the wild to plan, and also identify people who can execute the plan.” Now, Chatterjee said, “This is their moment.” Related : The E.P.A.

But the cub known as P-121 was getting a second chance. Found in a roadside ditch in the Simi Valley near Los Angeles, he was one of scores of California mountain lions struck by vehicles each year . At only about five months old, he should have spent another year with his mother. But she was nowhere to be seen. An X-ray brought good news: the break in his hind leg was clean. He would undergo surgery and remain at a wildlife rehabilitation facility for several months, until his limb mended and he was old enough to fend for himself. If all went well, he would return to the wild. The story of P-121, who arrived at the San Diego Humane Society’s Ramona Wildlife Center on Thanksgiving Day in 2023, offers a searing glimpse into the challenges facing the animals.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT As the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota takes a toll on local businesses, whose customers and employees are staying off the streets out of fear, some public budgets heads have a message to the White House: Stop. Democratic state treasurers, auditors and comptrollers from 15 states — including two from California — sent a letter on Wednesday to President Trump calling for a halt to aggressive tactics that they say have depressed economic activity and tax collections. “Many of our states already send more tax dollars to Washington than we receive in federal support,” read the letter, whose signatories also included the fiscal officers of Maryland, Oregon and New York. “We are now expected to absorb the fiscal consequences of enforcement activities. This is not acceptable.” State fiscal officers do not often weigh in as a group on law enforcement matters. They leave that to attorneys general, who frequently write collective letters and court briefs, typically with members of their own party. The letter was organized by For the Long Term , a group of progressive-leaning state and local financial overseers who aim to foster economic and budgetary stability beyond the rapid churn of election cycles. The signatories said they came together when they determined that what was unfolding in Minnesota crossed into their domain as stewards of the public purse. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment on the letter. Tom Homan, Mr. Trump’s border czar, said on Wednesday that the administration would withdraw 700 immigration agents from Minnesota, leaving around 2,000 there. Other states have also experienced extended Immigration and Customs Enforcement presence, including Illinois, where Operation Midway Blitz took place in the fall . Mike Frerichs, the state’s treasurer, said sales and income taxes dipped during that period, as people fearing federal officers avoided restaurants and shops in neighborhoods like Chicago’s Little Village. “If you’re terrorizing people, and they think they’re going to be arrested or shot, they’re going to stay home, and they’re not going to be spending money,” Mr. Frerichs said. “Donald Trump and Stephen Miller may not care about immigrants to this country, but the fear and chaos that they are sowing in our cities are having ripple effects on taxpaying Americans.” Officials from other states are thinking about what might happen if ICE came through in force. “There’s always concern that our state might be next,” said Mike Pellicciotti, the treasurer of Washington, which has large immigrant communities in both agriculture and technology. He said ICE deployments were just one of several blows from the federal government over the past year, including tariffs . “This reckless economic policy is having an impact across the board,” Mr. Pellicciotti said. “We’re a trade-dependent state. We’re a state that relies on a talented work force from around the world wanting to come.” Mr. Trump has threatened to withhold funding for Democratic cities and states, including child care subsidies, public housing assistance and food stamps. The White House has also pulled back clean energy and other infrastructure grants, such as $205 million for the $16 billion Gateway project between New York and New Jersey. For state and local finances, the damage from the Trump administration’s immigration restrictions and expanding enforcement efforts may take a while to play out, said William Glasgall, public finance adviser at the Volcker Alliance, a think tank. Many states, especially in the Northeast and the industrial Midwest, have depended on immigration to keep their populations steady or growing. “Budgets are getting tighter, and if the immigration restrictions begin to crimp the tax base — we’ll see in the next year or two what this looks like in terms of sales tax growth and income tax growth — then you have reason for concern,” Mr. Glasgall said. The list of signatories included states that received an influx of migrants during the Biden administration, a situation that also had tremendous fiscal costs. They were borne primarily by cities like Denver, whose mayor unsuccessfully pleaded for federal help as he spent tens of millions of dollars to accommodate the new arrivals. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that while the surge boosted tax revenues for state and local governments, their spending went up by about $10 billion more. State fiscal officers said current efforts to expel unauthorized immigrants had much wider implications for local economic activity because even legal residents feared being stopped and detained. “All of a sudden it presents this huge barrier to people participating in their communities,” said Dave Young, Colorado’s treasurer. Plus, he said, immigrants are essential to the state’s work force. “The concern that I have is that so many of these people that are here performing these tremendous services that we absolutely need, if they leave Colorado put us in a pretty significant economic bind,” he said.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT President Trump repeatedly promised during his campaign that he would end the war in Ukraine in one day. But by most measures, the war has grown worse for Ukrainians since Mr. Trump returned to the White House, not better. More civilians were killed and injured in 2025 than in the previous year. More missiles and drones are hitting city centers. Russia captured more territory in its slow-moving advances in 2025 than in any year since 2022, when it launched its full-scale invasion. Moscow has practically destroyed Ukraine’s power grid during the country’s harshest winter in more than a decade. “It was a hard year — how else can you imagine it?” said Oleksandr Polishchuk, whose wife was one of 13 people killed when a missile slammed into their apartment building in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in April. “Shelling, having to go to work, dealing with household issues, no electricity, no heating. I think it was very hard, extremely hard.” After taking office in January 2025, Mr. Trump tossed out the American playbook for the war. He made overtures to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, the aggressor in the conflict and an avowed opponent of the West, while distancing the United States from Ukraine. U.S. aid to Ukraine fell by 99 percent in 2025 compared with the year before, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German research center. Mr. Trump stopped giving American weapons to Kyiv, unless it or its Western allies paid for them.

On top of the loss, he said he was coping with shelling and the lack of electricity and heating. Credit... Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times At the same time, Russia increased its own production of missiles, drones, shells and mines. Moscow used the weapons at a rapid clip, in part to improve its position in talks pushed by Mr. Trump, who has made no secret of his desire to be credited with ending the war. Delegations from Russia, Ukraine and the United States are scheduled to hold the next round of negotiations on Tuesday and Wednesday in Geneva. As he has moved away from a Biden administration policy of isolating Mr. Putin, Mr. Trump has succeeded in getting Russia and Ukraine to talk about settlement terms, including in face-to-face meetings in recent weeks. Mr. Trump has largely set aside traditional diplomatic principles that he said had done nothing to end the war, turning instead to negotiators he sees as seasoned deal makers. He has also imposed sanctions that have reduced the oil revenue that fuels Moscow’s war machine. But Mr. Putin has slow-walked his way through the months of negotiations, using them to buy time to continue his assault. A year into Mr. Trump’s second term and almost four years after Russia’s invasion, Mr. Putin has signaled no retreat from his goals of taking more Ukrainian territory and imposing Russian dominance. The White House did not respond to a request for comment for this article. Mr. Trump has acknowledged that the war is much harder to resolve than he thought it would be. Ukrainian officials have argued that the American president would have to take stronger action for Mr. Putin to change his thinking. Strength is a quality that Mr. Trump prizes above most others. He has asserted that Mr. Putin “respects” him in a way he did not respect previous U.S. administrations, which he says gives him leverage. Mr. Trump has said numerous times that the war never would have happened had he been president when the full invasion began in 2022. But Mr. Trump has shown a deference to Mr. Putin that has assuredly not been lost on the Kremlin leader. Mr. Trump has called his relationship with Mr. Putin “fantastic” and has repeatedly said that Mr. Putin “wants peace.” Mr. Trump has at times accepted Mr. Putin’s rewriting of history, including by blaming President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine for starting the war.

Lynsey Addario for The New York Times Outside of occasional public criticism and the oil sanctions, Mr. Putin has largely dodged Mr. Trump’s threats. In July, Mr. Trump said he would give Russia “about 10 or 12 days ” to end the war before imposing new sanctions. Mr. Trump then announced a summit with Mr. Putin in Alaska, and the deadline passed. A month later, Mr. Trump again threatened “massive sanctions.” But he also showed reporters a photograph sent to him by Mr. Putin of the two men in Alaska and called it a sign of honor and respect . All the while, Moscow’s attacks inflicted a growing toll on Ukrainians. In 2025, Russia killed more than 2,500 Ukrainian civilians, more than in any year since 2022 and a 20 percent increase from 2024, according to United Nations statistics . Russia sent more than 53,000 long-range drones to civilian targets in Ukraine in 2025, almost five times as many as in 2024, according to a data set created by The New York Times using numbers from the Ukrainian Air Force. Moscow is also increasingly firing on city centers with ballistic missiles, which move so quickly that air-defense systems have difficulty knocking them down. Russia has launched 154 of those missiles at Ukraine this year, according to the data set, about three times the number fired during the same period last year. Got a confidential news tip?

To lead the American delegation, Mr. Trump has chosen real-estate developers with a personal connection to him.

Mauricio Lima for The New York Times “There are no limits for Putin, because a human dimension is not a priority of these negotiations,” Ms. Matviichuk said. “The politicians discuss natural minerals, Russia’s territorial interests, even Putin’s vision of Ukrainian history, but they don’t speak about people at all.” This month, Ms. Matviichuk, who runs an organization that shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022 for documenting war crimes by Moscow, posed a question on Facebook : “Why has Trump’s year of negotiations been the deadliest for civilians in Ukraine since the full-scale invasion?” The post received thousands of reactions. One woman alluded to Mr. Trump’s publicly stated desire for his own Nobel, asking if he would be more loyal to Ukraine if she gave her prize to him. Many Ukrainians, however, see Mr. Trump as loyal only to himself, and they have feared that in his rush to end the war, he will force an unjust peace on Ukraine. Ukraine’s European allies have said that Russia cannot be rewarded for its aggression. But a 28-point peace plan drafted late last year by American and Russian envoys looked to Ukraine like a demand for surrender.

Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 8:24 min Learn more Share full article By Erika Solomon Leily Nikounazar and Sanjana Varghese Produced by Jon Hazell Feb. 17, 2026 With patriotic anthems and chants against the country’s clerical rulers, Iranians on Tuesday began commemorating the end of a traditional 40-day mourning period for loved ones killed at the peak of the government’s bloody crackdown on nationwide protests. The authorities have moved quickly to tamp down protests or other demonstrations of anti-government sentiment to mark the occasion, with videos verified by The New York Times showing security patrols in at least two cities. Tuesday is the first of what are expected to be several days of memorial ceremonies across the country to honor the 40th day since thousands of protesters were killed from Jan. 8 to Jan. 10. The commemorations will test both of the success of the crackdown and the ability of government opponents to find new ways to defy the state. Such ceremonies have played a pivotal role in the country’s modern history: They were a staging ground for the protests that eventually overthrew Iran’s shah in 1979. This week may not be such a dramatic turning point, but dissidents are already using the occasion as a way to voice their anger at the government. Some are transforming what was once a somber, religious funeral rite into boisterous, celebratory affairs, in a stark rejection of the country’s austere rulers. Video “They’ve reinvented this with a revolutionary rage,” said Arash Azizi, a historian of Iran based in New York. “It is an attempt by Iranians to take back their country and rediscover their nationalism.” For weeks before the memorials began, security forces sought to intimidate some families into not holding public memorials, according to rights groups and relatives of several slain protesters interviewed by The New York Times. On Tuesday, videos verified by The Times showed security forces patrolling some towns, including Lesfijan in the north, where trucks filmed on the streets were loaded with troops wearing helmets and camouflage gear. Commemorations for the dead after 40 days have been at the heart of Iran’s mourning culture for generations — one of the final rituals of farewell before returning to the rhythms of daily life. The ceremonies are common among the region’s Shiite Muslims. They have pre-Islamic roots in Iran too, and are practiced by Iranians of all faiths. As a profound cultural symbol in Iran, the authorities this week appeared keen to control the memorials. The government itself announced plans for official mourning ceremonies in the capital, Tehran, and the northern city of Mashhad. “We are grieving for the blood that was shed,” the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in a speech on Tuesday. He called security forces killed in the unrest “the highest-ranking martyrs.” Bystanders and protesters who were “misled,” he said, were also martyrs. Others killed “were the very corrupters, the seditionists, and coup plotters themselves,” he said. “Their reckoning is with God. We have nothing to do with them.” Image A protest in Tehran in early January. Credit... Getty Images The government argues that it was fighting unrest during the protests that was fomented by “terrorists” backed by Israel and the United States, leading to more than 3,000 deaths. Rights groups say that vastly underestimates the toll, particularly from Jan. 8 to 10, which many now consider the bloodiest days in Iran’s modern history. Over a total of three weeks of protests, the U.S.-based rights group HRANA says more than 7,000 protesters were killed, with most killed in that three-day period. One of the victims was Robina Aminian, a 23-year-old fashion student, whose family said she was shot in the head while protesting in Tehran. Officials banned her family from public 40th-day memorials, according to her aunt, Hali Nouri, who lives in Europe. For more than a month, Ms. Nouri said, plainclothes police were stationed at either end of the alleyway where the Aminian family resides. Reaching Ms. Aminian’s grave will be particularly arduous for her family. Security forces have regularly forced families to bury dissidents in remote areas to prevent their graves from becoming a gathering point, and Ms. Aminian’s family was forced to lay her to rest in a remote, snowy village of western Iran. “My sister says, ‘Even if they shoot bullets, I will go for her 40th day,’” Ms. Nouri told The Times.

Credit... via the Aminian family There are increasing signs of dissent across Iran in the face of the continuing crackdown. At several universities, students have repeatedly attempted to hold sit-ins, according to student social media channels. And in some cities, videos showed Iranians took to their rooftops in the cover of darkness to chant for the toppling of the supreme leader. On Monday night, a small protest broke out in the southwestern town of Abdanan. In one video verified by The Times, people can be seen chanting “death to Khamenei” as passing cars honk. Video Another video , which appeared to be from Tuesday morning, shows security forces deploying in the town with armored vehicles. Another video showed large crowds screaming as they fled smoke and detonations near a cemetery in Abdanan. New displays of defiance do not necessarily mean that momentum toward a new wave of nationwide protests is building, said Farzan Sabet, an analyst on Iran and Middle East politics at the Geneva Graduate Institute in Switzerland. “What I think everyone is waiting for is whether the other shoe will drop — that is, whether a U.S. strike will happen or not.” The severity of Iran’s crackdown is also partly a reaction to threats beyond its borders. President Trump has massed warships in Persian Gulf waters, a show of force amid tenuous U.S.-Iran talks over reining in Iran’s nuclear and military capabilities. A brief round of talks was held in Geneva on Tuesday. But the risk of another regional war looms. “Almost everyone is waiting for Trump’s promises to be carried out and for foreign help to arrive,” said Masoud, an accountant in Mashhad who did not want to be identified by his full name for fear of repercussions. “The people have done everything they could.” Some Iranians said they are trying to hold 40th-day commemorations despite the restrictions. The family of the slain 17-year-old protester Mohammad Mahdi Ganj Danesh, signed pledges not to chant political slogans at their memorial, according to a family friend. Still, the authorities refused to grant them permission to hold their memorial at their mosque in the northern town of Zanjan. They, like several other families interviewed, rented an event hall instead. Video of the memorial obtained by The Times shows large crowds crammed together to celebrate his life and protest against the government. “The fallen flower has become a gift to the homeland,” they chanted and clapped. Video Instead of tearful rituals of mourning, many families of those killed at protests have transformed their commemorations with dancing, singing and clapping over people’s graves. This is seen as a way of defying traditionally somber religious customs that many Iranians now associate with the Islamic Republic’s austere rule. Video of the 40th-day ceremony for Raha Bahlooli-Pour, a student at the University of Tehran, shows mourners playing folk tunes instead of the customary recitations of Quranic verse. In the video, verified by The Times, women perform the traditional kel, a high-pitched ululation most Iranians traditionally reserve for weddings. Reimagining mourning rituals has been a part of Iran’s culture at least since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, said Mr. Azizi, the historian. At the time, Islamic revolutionaries transformed 40th-day ceremonies from somber affairs to “rabble-rousing occasions.” After an anti-gover",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of Spain said on Tuesday that his government will ask prosecutors to investigate social media giants X, Meta and TikTok for allegedly spreading child sexual abuse material generated by artificial intelligence, the latest salvo in a Europe-wide effort to regulate big tech companies. “These platforms are undermining the mental health, dignity, and rights of our children,” Mr. Sánchez wrote on social media . “The state cannot allow this. The impunity of these giants must end.” X and TikTok did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Meta declined to comment. After the French police raided the Paris offices of X in connection with similar accusations, the company said it “categorically denies any wrongdoing.” The Spanish announcement intensifies a growing dispute between European governments and American tech companies , which have been backed by the Trump administration over efforts on the continent to limit the industry. The clash has revealed starkly different visions between the United States and its tech giants and the European Union and its member states over what counts as protected speech, and the role of corporations in guaranteeing the welfare of those affected by their platforms. Europe has become a central experiment for the ability of democratic governments to regulate and effectively penalize one of the world’s most dominant industries. In December, the European Union issued the first fine under its new Digital Services Act, penalizing X, the social media platform owned by Elon Musk, for 120 million euros, about $140 million , for violations. This month, French police searched the local offices of X as part of the French cybercrime division’s own investigation into the spread of child pornography and Holocaust denial on the site. Britain’s data protection regulator has also announced an investigation into X over sexually explicit images generated by its A.I. chatbot, Grok. Ireland’s Data Protection Commission also said on Tuesday that it had opened an investigation into whether Grok had allowed pornographic images of children to spread on the platform. European leaders say their efforts are aimed at protecting citizens from abuse, rather than an attempt — as American politicians and tech leaders have argued — to limit free speech. Mr. Sánchez, a left-wing leader who has not been shy about challenging Mr. Trump or the American tech giants, asked prosecutors to “investigate the crimes that X, Meta, and TikTok may be committing through the creation and dissemination of child pornography using their AI.” This month, Spain joined France , Denmark and Australia in seeking to ban social media for children under the age of 16 , with Mr. Sánchez saying, “We will protect them from the digital Wild West.” His government’s proposed ban still requires parliamentary approval. But the proposed measure, and Mr. Sánchez referring to “crimes committed” by Grok, immediately triggered a vulgar and personally targeted attack against Mr. Sánchez by Mr. Musk. Some Spanish political analysts suggested that it was just the reaction hoped for by Mr. Sánchez, who has sought to position himself as a liberal leader on a global stage as he faces deep political divisions and scandals at home.

Feb. 17, 2026 Leer en español The square started filling well before dawn. Some revelers arrived clad in neon fishnets and doused in glitter. Others, who had been at parties elsewhere, napped on a grassy patch. The musicians came last, lugging drums and trumpets. It was Sunday morning during carnival in Rio de Janeiro, and the square in the city’s historic center was the setting for the start of a kind of roving marathon block party known as the Boi Tolo. The Boi Tolo has no set time, script or route, a swell of thousands of euphoric revelers marching through the city at a frantic pace. Those who miss the start spend the day trying to catch up, firing off messages in group chats: “Where is Boi Tolo?” Keeping pace is grueling. “Along the way, you start wondering, ‘Should I give up? I’m going to give up,’” said Lucas Fagundes, 35. “It’s like the ultimate test of your stamina.” The Boi Tolo has no set time, script or route. Few parties represent the fervor and chaos of Rio’s street carnival scene better than the Boi Tolo. Far from the glamour of official carnival parades, it has come to embody the gritty informal celebrations that take over the streets. By 6:50 a.m. on Sunday, the crowd at the square had grown to a few hundred people clad in bejeweled cowboy hats and shimmering bikinis. The musicians erupted in an improvised symphony of brass, drums and percussion instruments. A giant human chain formed around the band and everyone set off through the narrow streets, paralyzing traffic. As they passed a tram stop, a shiny Medusa blew soap bubbles toward commuters. Stilt walkers passed a bus stuck in the sea of people. One of the few rules of Boi Tolo is to keep moving. Whenever anyone stopped for an impassioned kiss, the crowd erupted: “Kiss and walk! Kiss and walk!” The direction is not always clear. “We decide the route in the moment,” said Luís Otávio Almeida, 62, one of the party’s founders. The Boi Tolo started by chance two decades ago, when a group of people arrived at a public square during carnival Sunday ready to party, but found no party, apparently misled by a newspaper announcement. One of the few rules of Boi Tolo is to keep moving. Frustrated, they decided to improvise. A beer vendor nearby had a tambourine. Someone called a friend with a drum. A lone trumpeter showed up, joining the group. Then, a reveler picked up a piece of cardboard and in lipstick scribbled “Boi Tolo,” or “foolish bull” (for their falling for the faulty announcement). The tradition stuck and it now draws tens of thousands of people each year. “Boi Tolo only exists because people want it to exist,” Mr. Almeida said. “Carnival is made on the streets. It’s made by the people.” This year’s party eventually spilled into a sprawling park, where costumed spectators hung off tree branches and squeezed under an overpass, as hundreds of people cheered above. To many “Cariocas,” as people from Rio are known, carnival is often akin to an extreme sport that requires grit and endurance. In recent years, growing numbers of visitors and searing temperatures have made it harder for even the most resilient to party hard. To try to beat the heat, Boi Tolo set out earlier than usual this year. Still, as temperatures topped 90 degrees, people fanned themselves and doused each other with water. By 11 a.m., the sun was scorching; a stilt walker in a sequin bikini crumpled to the ground. “I’m fine, my blood pressure just dropped,” she said, as she got up and started twerking again. Boi Tolo participants proceeding through a tunnel near the beach. The procession headed toward a pair of tunnels leading to Rio’s beachfront. Most participants were drenched in sweat, their makeup melting. But this is what they had been waiting for; the highlight of Boi Tolo. The beat quickened, echoing through the tunnel. The crowd burst into euphoric jubilation. “It’s magical,” said Perola Mendonça, 26. “It’s this incredible feeling of ecstasy.” On the other end, the party kept moving along the beachfront. By 4:30 p.m., the participants reached the end of the boardwalk, but they weren’t ready to stop. So they turned around and headed back toward the tunnel. After a 12-hour march through the city, a few hundred partygoers were still not ready to quit. With the light fading, they made their way back toward the city center where it all started. As they passed a stretch of beach they rushed onto the sand. A man in a cowboy hat hooked his snare drum on the crossbar of a goal post. The crowd closed in, as the musicians started playing a party anthem with lyrics the crowd could relate to. “I’m not going home! I’m not going home!” the revelers belted out, jumping up and down in the sand. Exhausted, Yasmin Santiago, 22, leaned on the goal post. She had joined a few hours earlier, not knowing what it was but eager to party. “This is Boi Tolo? No way!” Ms. Santiago said when she found out, her face lighting up. Turning to her friend, she called out: “Girl, did you hear that? We found Boi Tolo!We were looking for it for ages.” Image Some Boi Tolo revelers had waited all night for the festivities to begin. A correction was made on Feb. 17, 2026 : An earlier version of a picture caption misstated which revelers were shown. It was a group lying in the grass after waiting overnight for the festivities to begin, not exhausted participants at the end. When we learn of a mistake, we acknowledge it with a correction.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The fans next to the Olympic sliding track oohed and aahed with each sharp turn. They admired the navigational precision and soft landing. They shouted, “You’re No. 1!” They were cheering for a drone pilot. “I’m almost feeling like I am with the athletes on the tracks,” said Ralph Hogenbirk, the pilot operating one of the many drones that have become the buzzing — and, for some, unsettling — soundtrack of the 2026 Winter Olympics. The robotic wasps chase behind lugers, skeleton pilots and bobsledders bombing down the ice track in Cortina d’Ampezzo. They are in hot pursuit of alpine skiers in the mountains of Bormio and record-shattering speedskaters gliding around the rinks in Milan, transporting viewers at home to the slopes and ice. All of their unerring following has earned them a following of their own. One night last week in Cortina, a small crowd gathered outside a white tent, cordoned off between a red tractor and heaps of dirty snow, a few yards below the start gate for the skeleton race. Inside, Mr. Hogenbirk sat in a corner, a visor over his eyes, piloting his nearly nine-ounce drone. It hovered behind the skeleton athletes as they collected themselves, crept behind them as they began their mad dash to start the race and then picked up speed, whirring behind the competitors as they shot down the track’s first curves. Image A drone during the men’s moguls finals on Sunday in Livigno, Italy. Credit... Gabriela Bhaskar/The New York Times A screen in the tent showed the drone’s flight path, including when it left the track after the initial curves. It veered left and looped back over construction sites, parking lots, roped-off icy areas and into the cradled hands, red with cold, of Mr. Hogenbirk’s technician. “Very cool,” said Mary-Anne Grotheer, 33, the wife of a skeleton competitor who left the races to watch the drones come and go. Italians shouted, “Bravissimo!” and inquired about the drone’s specs. Germans appreciated its engineering. A group of British fans didn’t know what to think. “What the hell?” said Oliver Dickie, 26, a lawyer from London, as the returning drone, its green light blinking in the night, buzzed by on the way back to the tent. He said he imagined it improved the experience for spectators watching at home but wondered “how scary this would be” to be tracked by one. Athletes said not very. “I actually didn’t know they were there,” said skier Lara Markthaler, 19, of South Africa, who competed in the women’s giant slalom on Sunday. She said she had a tougher time with “the start camera like 10 centimeters from our face. That is what we do notice.” Others couldn’t wait to ski with Skynet . Image A drone following Sofia Goggia of Italy during the giant slalom competition on Sunday. Credit... James Hill for The New York Times “I saw the other competitors have drones and I was like, ‘Wow, that’s so cool, and I want to have that for my run,’” said Elin Van Pelt of Iceland, 20. She added with a laugh that having a drone follow her run for a television audience would mean, “I made it.” Drones have been used at the Olympics since the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, but have become increasingly common as the technology improves and sports audiences grow more used to up-close action. In these Games, drones are being called on to do more than ever before. Mr. Hogenbirk, a founder of the company Dutch Drone Gods, which has a background in professional drone racing, said that pilots of the drones had made sure the athletes were comfortable with them before the Games began. “Maybe they hear it a little bit, but it’s not distracting because they’re so fully focused on where they’re going,” said Mr. Hogenbirk. He said that his team had filmed each athlete before the Games, and that “everyone had a chance to say, ‘No, I don’t want this.’ None of them did.” Mr. Hogenbirk was speaking outside the tent, where he came to greet his adoring fans after his shift had ended. “People are just like filming and zooming in with their phones,” he said, adding that when the drones land people sometimes cheer, “Olympic medal!” Among the drone spectators was Kate Bentley, 26, a data analyst from Bristol, England. She was on a ski trip with friends and decided to check out the Olympics, she said, but found the skeleton athletes whooshing by her at about 90 miles per hour less than riveting. “I think skeleton could be a bit boring,” she said, “without the drones.” Jason Horowitz is the Madrid bureau chief for The Times, covering Spain, Portugal and the way people live throughout Europe.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Indirect talks between American and Iranian officials in Switzerland ended on Tuesday with an agreement on a “set of guiding principles,” according to Iran’s foreign minister, who said both sides had agreed to exchange drafts on a potential deal. The foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, was as positive as he was vague, providing little clarity on what had been discussed or when the next round of discussions might be held. American officials did not immediately comment publicly on the talks, but one U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations, said the two sides had made progress. The official said the Iranians would provide more detailed proposals in the next two weeks to address some of the gaps between the United States and Iran, but did not provide any specifics. Mr. Araghchi told Iranian state television that the talks, which were held in Geneva and lasted about three hours, had been “more constructive” and had made “good progress” compared with a previous round of negotiations in Oman this month. “We now have a clear path ahead, which in my view is positive,” he said. But Mr. Araghchi said a deal was not imminent, as the Middle East remained on edge over the possibility of an American attack should negotiations collapse. Iran has insisted that the talks be strictly limited to its nuclear program, even as U.S. officials have said they would push to curb the range of Iran’s ballistic missiles and its support of militias across the region. Mr. Araghchi did not address those points in his comments to Iranian state television, saying only that the two sides had reached a “general understanding on a set of guiding principles” to continue discussions and to “move toward drafting the text of a possible agreement.” “This does not mean that we can reach an agreement quickly, but at least the path has begun,” he said. Three Iranian officials familiar with the talks said that Iran had indicated a willingness to suspend nuclear enrichment for three to five years — which would cover the duration of Mr. Trump’s presidency — and then join a regional consortium for civilian grade enrichment. Iran would also dilute its stockpile of uranium on its own soil in the presence of international inspectors. In exchange, Iran has demanded that the United States lift financial and banking sanctions and the embargo on its oil sales. The officials, who asked not to be identified to discuss sensitive negotiations, said Iran was also dangling financial incentives and opportunities for investments and trade with the United States, including in Iran’s oil and energy sectors. The negotiations were hosted at the Omani ambassador’s residence by Oman’s foreign minister, Badr Albusaidi, who mediated the previous round of talks. A spokesman for Iran’s foreign ministry said ahead of the talks that Omani officials would shuttle between the two sides. Mr. Albusaidi said on social media after the talks that they had concluded “with good progress towards identifying common goals and relevant technical issues.” “Together we made serious efforts to define a number of guiding principles for a final deal,” he added. “Much work is yet to be done.” Steve Witkoff, the Middle East envoy, and Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law, had been expected to attend the negotiations, according to two U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy. Mr. Trump, speaking on Monday on Air Force One, said he would be involved in the talks “indirectly” and that they would be “very important.” He said Iran wanted to make a deal. The American president has ordered a buildup of U.S. forces in the region — including two aircraft carriers — after vowing last month to aid antigovernment demonstrators in Iran. The Iranian government quelled those protests in a bloody crackdown that killed thousands, according to rights groups. Now, Mr. Trump is calling on Iran to reach a deal to limit its nuclear and military capabilities or face a possible attack. Last week, he wrote on social media that he preferred a deal with Iran, but that if one could not be brokered, “we will just have to see what the outcome will be.” Countries in the region worry that a potential American strike, and an Iranian retaliation that could draw in Israel, could destabilize the Middle East and endanger U.S. allies in the Arab world that host American soldiers. In a speech on Tuesday shortly after the talks began, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, responded defiantly to Mr. Trump’s orders to send a second aircraft carrier to the region. “An aircraft carrier is certainly a dangerous piece of equipment,” the ayatollah said. “But more dangerous than the carrier is the weapon that can send it to the bottom of the sea.” He also called demands to limit the range of Iran’s ballistic missiles “illogical,” arguing that such demands interfered with his nation’s right to possess weapons of self-defense. “Any country without deterrent weapons will be crushed under the feet of its enemies,” he said. On Tuesday, Iranian naval forces closed parts of the Strait of Hormuz, a key global shipping lane, for several hours to conduct a second day of naval “war games,” according to the semiofficial Tasnim news agency. The Iranian government is under considerable pressure to agree to a deal. Iran’s economy has struggled under crippling international sanctions, which helped ignite the latest wave of protests against the country’s authoritarian government. Iranian officials have argued they will not make concessions on nuclear enrichment without sanctions relief. Iran’s deputy foreign minister told state media that in return Tehran could offer Washington lucrative investment opportunities in sectors like oil, gas and mining. Last year, U.S. and Iranian officials tried to negotiate a nuclear deal that would end the sanctions, but Israel launched a military campaign against the Iranian nuclear program as the talks were underway, leading to a 12-day war between the two countries. U.S. stealth bombers joined the Israeli assault, attacking three Iranian nuclear sites. Mr. Trump initially said that the U.S. bombing had obliterated Iran’s nuclear program, but American intelligence later said that it had been badly damaged , not destroyed. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who met with Mr. Trump last week in Washington, said on Sunday that the American president believed that Iran “must surely understand that they missed out last time” by not showing more flexibility in the 2025 talks. “He thinks there is a serious probability that they won’t miss out this time,” Mr. Netanyahu told a group of American Jewish leaders in Jerusalem, although he added that he was far more skeptical of “any deal with Iran.” Tyler Pager contributed reporting from Washington, and Farnaz Fassihi from New York.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT A senior official for Gaza on President Trump’s “Board of Peace” met with a top Hamas leader last week and pressed the militant group on the issue of disarmament, according to two officials briefed on the encounter, amid concern that Israel may return to war. The direct talks between Nickolay Mladenov, a former United Nations envoy serving as the board’s “high representative” for Gaza, and Khalil al-Hayya, the chief Hamas negotiator, underscored that the group remains a key actor in Gaza’s postwar transition. The board, a new international body with a mandate to secure peace in conflict zones, is set to have its inaugural meeting in Washington on Thursday. Officials from the board are finalizing a demilitarization plan that they hope will be acceptable to both Israel and Hamas, allowing the group to keep some small arms , at least initially. Yet Mr. al-Hayya refused to discuss demilitarization with Mr. Mladenov, the officials said, during their meeting in Cairo. It was unclear why he did not engage on the subject. In an interview with Al Jazeera that aired on Dec. 10, Khaled Meshal, a Qatar-based Hamas leader, said that to take away weapons from Palestinians was to take away their soul. Mr. Trump’s 20-point peace plan , which paved the way for the October cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, calls on the group to give up its weapons, but members of its leadership have not publicly agreed to that demand. On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested that if Hamas failed to give up its weapons, Israel would refuse to move to the next phase of the cease-fire. That phase is widely expected to involve Israel further withdrawing its forces from Gaza and facilitating efforts for reconstruction in the territory. “Hamas must first be disarmed and then Gaza must be demilitarized,” Mr. Netanyahu told a conference in Jerusalem, adding that the group still holds 60,000 Kalashnikov assault rifles. Yossi Fuchs, the Israeli government’s cabinet secretary, said on Monday that if Hamas does not disarm, the military will need to return to “complete the mission” in Gaza. In the past, talks between Hamas and the United States have mostly been conducted through Qatari and Egyptian mediators. The direct talks suggest that Board of Peace officials are urgently pushing for a breakthrough on demilitarization. A representative for Mr. Mladenov did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Hamas’s media office. Mr. Mladenov was asked on Friday about demilitarization while speaking at the Munich Security Conference and said, “The reality is that all of this needs to move very fast.” He went on to say there was a risk the cease-fire could collapse, leading to a return to war.

Evan Vucci/Associated Press For Hamas, armed struggle against Israel is a core part of its ideology, and even discussing demilitarization has caused fissures among the group. Despite the apparent deadlock, Mr. Trump has projected optimism about the Board of Peace’s efforts in Gaza. Writing on social media on Sunday, he said that member states had pledged more than $5 billion toward “Humanitarian and Reconstruction efforts” and committed thousands of troops “to maintain Security and Peace for Gazans.” Senior officials from board member states are expected to announce pledges at the inaugural meeting later this week and discuss the humanitarian situation in Gaza. More than 20 countries have so far joined the board. Some European countries have expressed reservations about the board’s mandate, which extends to conflicts beyond Gaza, and U.S. allies including the United Kingdom and Germany have declined an invitation to join. Analysts have cautioned that the president may be attempting to establish a rival to the United Nations, with himself at the helm. Aaron Boxerman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Dressed all in black with her dark hair pulled tightly into a bun, the Russian teenager many in the figure skating world have been wondering about finally showed up in Milan on Monday. A day before she began competition at the Winter Olympics, the young woman, 18-year-old Adeliia Petrosian, practiced for the first time at the official training rink. A swarm of camera lenses followed her as she glided across the ice. She landed jump after jump, easily turning her 5-foot body into a tiny rotating rocket. Afterward, she scurried past reporters, stopping only long enough to say in Russian, “Mood is excellent!” As the Olympic women’s figure skating competition begins on Tuesday, Petrosian is a contender for the gold medal — under the cloud of the biggest doping scandal in her sport’s history. Yet she is relatively unknown outside Russia because the country’s athletes were barred from international competition in 2022 over its invasion of Ukraine. The Winter Games will be just her second senior-level event outside Russia since then. “I can tell you that none of us have any idea how she will do, and she doesn’t have any idea, either,” said Adam Rippon, who won Olympic bronze for the United States in 2018 and coached at the 2022 Beijing Games. “But it’s kind of sad to think about that, if she does win a medal, how that will reflect on the sport.” Petrosian has the résumé of a potential medalist: Three-time and reigning Russian women’s national champion. A history of landing quadruple jumps, the hardest in skating. A coach who churns out Olympic champions, including Russians who have won gold at the last three Winter Games. But that coach was also at the center of scandal four years ago , when one of her charges, the 15-year-old Russian skater Kamila Valieva, failed a drug test and threw the Beijing Olympics into chaos. Valieva, one of Petrosian’s training mates, tested positive for the heart medication trimetazidine, which is banned because it is thought to increase stamina and endurance. She claimed that her grandfather had accidentally contaminated her strawberry dessert with his medication. Her failed drug test led to Russia being stripped of the team gold medal, and she served a four-year ban for doping. Even though Valieva was underage at the time, the rest of her team — including her coach, Eteri Tutberidze, and her choreographer, Daniil Gleikhengauz — were spared punishment. Image Eteri Tutberidze, right, and Daniil Gleikhengauz, who is listed as Petrosian’s official coach at the Olympics. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times There is no record of Petrosian testing positive and she has not been implicated in doping. But she and Valieva shared the same coaches, choreographer and training site in Moscow, where, according to findings by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, a medical team administered 56 different medications and dietary supplements to Valieva over two years, starting when she was 13. Now Petrosian is carrying the hopes of her country, one that is eager to re-enter the Olympic fold and rebound from a series of sanctions that have been imposed on it since the revelation of a government-sponsored doping scheme at the 2014 Winter Games. She is the sole Russian skater in the women’s event, but she isn’t officially representing her country. She is competing as a “neutral athlete,” like 13 other Russians at the Games. Though some international sports federations stood by their bans on Russian athletes for the Olympics in Italy, the International Skating Union, figure skating’s governing body, allowed two Russians to compete as neutrals: Petrosian and Petr Gumennik, who finished sixth in the men’s event last week. Last September, Petrosian won an Olympic qualifying event in Beijing, her international debut as a senior-level skater. Her choreographer, Gleikhengauz, was barred from that event for failing to pass the I.S.U. screening for neutrality, which means that it found indications that he supported the invasion of Ukraine, according to a person with knowledge of the ban who was not authorized to speak on behalf of the federation. Tutberidze did not apply to be Petrosian’s coach at that event or at the Olympics, the person said. An International Olympic Committee panel subsequently cleared Petrosian and Gleikhengauz to participate in the Milan-Cortina Games, where he is her official coach, according to the I.O.C. The organization did not immediately return a request for comment about why it cleared Gleikhengauz to coach in Milan after the I.S.U. had not cleared him for the qualifying event. Madison Chock and Evan Bates, the U.S. ice dancing team that won silver in Milan last week, were not awarded their gold medal for the team event in 2022 until the Summer Games two years later because Valieva’s doping case dragged on so long. But Bates said he supported the inclusion of Russian athletes at these Olympics. “In the spirit of the Games and fair play, I think there should be, in some regard, an avenue for those kinds of athletes,” he said. Still, skepticism surrounds Petrosian’s participation. Before she entered the Olympic drug-testing pool last May, the Russian antidoping agency was responsible for testing her for performance-enhancing drugs, the international skating federation said. But the World Anti-Doping Agency, the global body charged with ensuring fair competition in Olympic sports, does not recognize the Russian agency because it has failed to follow WADA rules. Image Adeliia Petrosian at the Russian Figure Skating Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, last year. Credit... Anton Vaganov/Reuters Since last May, Petrosian also has been drug tested by the International Testing Agency, which was formed after Russia’s state-sponsored cheating program was uncovered and is also responsible for testing athletes during the Games, the I.S.U. said. But some experts say questions around Petrosian and some other Russian athletes remain because the effects of doping can last years. “Russia remains noncompliant with WADA rules for its state-sponsored doping, but their athletes get waived through to the Games?” said Travis Tygart, chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency. “It’s exactly why athletes, fans and sponsors have lost confidence.” Tutberidze, a dual citizen of Russia and Georgia, is officially the coach of a male Georgian skater in Milan. But she was at the practice rink on Monday when Petrosian skated, looking very much like her coach. Witold Banka, the president of WADA, said that there was no legal basis to bar Tutberidze from coaching in Milan because an investigation into Valieva’s entourage found no proof of wrongdoing. But he added: “I don’t feel comfortable with her presence here.” Tutberidze, who ignored several interview requests, has a reputation for pushing young skaters so hard that they burn out early and sustain injuries, and for berating Valieva on live television four years ago. Entangled in the doping scandal, Valieva stumbled through her long program at the Beijing Games and finished in tears. Television cameras captured the moments afterward, when a grim-faced Tutberidze offered the teen scathing words. “Why did you stop fighting?” she said. Thomas Bach, the I.O.C. president at the time, said he was “very, very disturbed” to see Valieva being treated with “such coldness.” Image Kamila Valieva with her coach, Tutberidze, before her performance at the 2022 Beijing Olympics. Credit... Chang W. Lee/The New York Times In interviews and on social media, Petrosian has had nothing but praise for her coaches. She and Gleikhengauz were featured in a recent Russian edition of Marie Claire magazine, in which they discussed fashion — Petrosian’s style trends toward that of Audrey Hepburn and of Zendaya — and the importance of trust between an athlete and coach. Petrosian said she had dreamed of training with Tutberidze and her staff before she joined them at about age 12, and that",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT A judge in New Zealand who discovered last week that apology letters from a defendant in an arson case had been written with the help of artificial intelligence raised questions about the sincerity of her sentiments. “The issue of remorse is interesting,” said the judge, Tom Gilbert, of the district court in Christchurch, as he mulled the punishment of a woman who had pleaded guilty to arson and other charges. Remorse can be a mitigating factor in sentencing. Her letters to the victims and the court were nicely written, the judge said. He decided to do some sleuthing. “Out of curiosity I punched into two A.I. tools ‘draft me a letter for a judge expressing remorse for my offending,’” the judge said, according to a transcript of the sentencing hearing that was shared with The New York Times. “It became immediately apparent that these were two A.I.-generated letters, albeit with tweaks around the edges.” The case illustrates a global debate about using machines for meaningful communication. Judge Gilbert said he was not criticizing the defendant’s use of A.I. “But certainly when one is considering the genuineness of an individual’s remorse, simply producing a computer-generated letter does not really take me anywhere as far as I am concerned,” he said, according to the transcript. The judge was not alone in wrestling with the question of authenticity in A.I.-assisted writing in the case before him, which was initially reported by The New Zealand Herald . Increasingly, people are outsourcing many tasks to machines, including writing apologies , eulogies and wedding vows , perhaps saving precious time but also inviting the ire of some of their fellow humans. Growing reliance on A.I. has led some cultural commentators to bemoan “ the rise of the LLeMmings,” people who depend on large language models known as LLMs to aid much of their thinking and production, including in their personal lives . Social scientists say the questions raised by use of these tools go beyond etiquette. “It’s a mirror into who we are and what we care about as humans,” Jim A.C. Everett, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Kent in Britain, said in an email about the case in New Zealand and his own work on what is described as the “outsourcing penalty.” Dr. Everett worked on a series of recent studies on the perception of A.I. use and users. Generative A.I. tools like ChatGPT are promoted as time savers that produce better work faster, experts say. But people apparently believe that certain activities should take work in order to seem genuine, and more personal A.I.-generated efforts are received particularly poorly, his research suggests. Across the six studies Dr. Everett worked on, 4,000 participants were asked about 20 tasks — including writing computer code, concocting recipes and drafting love letters and apologies. The aim was to understand how people perceive those who use A.I. and how that perception might shift depending on the activity and the way the tools were used. “A.I. is a tool for efficiency, and it can be helpful, but it also typically involves, and signals, reduced effort,” Dr. Everett said. But the use of such tools acts as a kind of proxy for character traits, the researchers found. The findings, published in the journal Computers in Human Behavior , suggest that people generally perceived those using A.I. as lazier, less competent and less trustworthy, and their work as less meaningful and authentic. “When you spend time crafting a piece of writing or completing a task yourself, others can assume that message reflects your priorities: that what you write is authentically yours and represents what you care about,” Dr. Everett said. The situation in the New Zealand courtroom was a real-life test of the sentiments and perceptions that he and his fellow researchers sought to identify and understand. “An A.I. could be perfectly trained on all apologies that a person has ever written, but one might still think that a specific apology it then generates in a new instance is not an authentic apology because it does not come from the kind of processes deemed important in an apology: a personal recollection of the wrong, a commitment to change,” the study said. The study detected a difference in how people perceived using A.I. for social tasks, like writing a love letter, versus a practical tasks, like writing computer code. The more personal a task the more negative was their impression. Judge Gilbert ultimately said he was willing to give the defendant some credit for genuine remorse, looking beyond the letters. But he granted only a 5 percent reduction in the sentence instead of the 10 percent the defense lawyer had requested based on the defendant’s remorse. “I do not consider this is a case where 10 percent is justified and, indeed, 5 percent might be viewed as reasonably generous,” Judge Gilbert concluded. In the end, he sentenced the defendant to 27 months in prison. Ephrat Livni is a Times reporter covering breaking news around the world. She is based in Washington.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Belgium’s government summoned President Trump’s ambassador after he accused his host nation of an antisemitic action and criticized a Belgian official in a series of posts on social media. The meeting on Tuesday between the ambassador, Bill White, and a representative from Belgium’s foreign office came at a moment of heightened tension as the Trump administration paints governments across Europe as out of line with American values. Mr. White criticized Belgium on Monday on social media over an investigation in Antwerp into a few Jewish mohels who perform ritual circumcision, and who the authorities say may be carrying out procedures without medical training . Mr. White wrote on X that Belgium should drop what he called a “RIDICULOUS AND ANTI SEMITIC ‘PROSECUTION.’” He tagged Mr. Trump and the American vice president and the secretary of state, among others. “You must make a legal provision to allow Jewish religious MOHELS to perform their duties here in Belgium,” Mr. White added, addressing the Belgian health minister. Circumcision is far less common in Europe than in the United States and Israel and different countries regulate it in different ways. In Belgium, laws mandate that all medical procedures must be performed by a licensed doctor, said Arne Brinckman, a representative for Belgium’s health minister. The Antwerp public prosecutor’s office put out a news release about the case in May and confirmed on Tuesday that the investigation was continuing. Kristof Aerts, a representative for the office, did not elaborate but noted that there were no “ongoing prosecutions.” Maxime Prévot, Belgium’s foreign minister, responded at length to Mr. White on X, saying that “personal attacks against a Belgian minister and interference in judicial matters violate basic diplomatic norms.” “Any suggestion that Belgium is antisemitic is false, offensive, and unacceptable,” Mr. Prévot wrote in the post, on Monday evening. A statement from the Belgian foreign ministry after the meeting — which included Mr. White and Theodora Gentzis, the secretary general of the Belgian foreign ministry — underlined its stance. Mr. Prévot was not present because he is traveling, Mr. White said and Mr. Prévot’s office confirmed. “Belgium attaches great importance to its relations with the United States of America. This partnership remains essential and we remain open to dialogue,” the statement said. “However, this dialogue must be based on respect for our institutions and our sovereignty.” On Tuesday morning, Gideon Sa’ar, Israel’s foreign minister, also weighed in on social media. “I understand that the mirror Ambassador @BillWhiteUSA has held up to you is unpleasant, but one might want to take this opportunity to take a hard look in that mirror and acknowledge reality,” he wrote. Mr. White said in an interview that he does not think Belgium is antisemitic. He said he had previously held private conversations about the issue with Belgian officials, and was frustrated by the slow progress. He said that he does not want the government to interfere in the judicial system by forcing it to drop the case, but that he would like government officials to speak in support of the men under investigation. Most governments in Europe and other democracies avoid becoming involved in their judicial systems, out of deference to judicial independence. Mr. White noted that Charles Kushner, Mr. Trump’s ambassador to France, faced a similar summons last year after complaining about what Mr. Kushner characterized as France’s failure to stem antisemitism in a letter to President Emmanuel Macron. The French foreign ministry denied the accusations. Mr. White said his own meeting with the foreign ministry was “very nice.” “I did not apologize for anything,” Mr. White said. “Nor would I.” Jeanna Smialek is the Brussels bureau chief for The Times.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Palmerston, a cat who served as the “chief mouser” for Britain’s diplomatic service, has died in Bermuda. He was about 12. “Palmerston, Diplocat extraordinaire, passed away peacefully,” his social media account announced on Friday , a day after he died. “He was a wonderful companion, with a gentle nature, and will be sorely missed.” “Farewell Palmerston, with love and thanks,” the Foreign Office wrote in a separate tribute on social media, acknowledging his work as a “feline diplomat.” Palmerston was born in 2013, according to the Foreign Office, and was named after Lord Palmerston, the 19th-century foreign secretary and two-time prime minister. The cat was adopted in 2016 from the Battersea Cats and Dogs Home, an animal rescue center in London, after he had spent a rough time on the streets: “He was hungry, underweight and had no microchip,” the BBC reported . He was initially tasked with dealing with mice in the Foreign Office’s Victorian-era headquarters in London, one of the British government’s grandest buildings. But he became a social media star, eventually amassing almost 100,000 followers on X — more than many British ambassadors have. He even dressed for the part. Famously, he never took off his tuxedo. A few months after Palmerston was adopted, Britain voted to leave the European Union, a decision that led to a period of political turmoil. On the ground, Palmerston kept calm and carried on catching mice. On social media, he was a friendly face for the country through his regular updates. During the coronavirus pandemic, Palmerston was eventually moved out of central London and formally retired to the countryside in 2020, with Andrew Murdoch, who worked in the Foreign Office alongside the cat. In Palmerston’s farewell letter to Simon McDonald, then the top civil servant at the Foreign Office, Palmerston revealed himself to be a master diplomat or even spy by admitting to “pretending to be asleep while overhearing all the foreign dignitaries’ conversations.” Last February, Palmerston wrote on X that he had come out of retirement to take up a new posting as a “feline relations consultant” in Bermuda with Mr. Murdoch. It was a good gig for an aging cat. Palmerston described his work as “feline relations consultant (semi-retired).” There, he “gave audiences to visitors between well-deserved naps,” the office of the governor said on social media . Many will miss him. But perhaps no one understood him better than Larry the Cat , the chief mouser at No. 10 Downing Street, the prime minister’s official residence, who has almost 900,000 followers on social media. At first, the two did not get along. Video footage taken soon after Palmerston arrived at the Foreign Office showed the cats in the sort of heated confrontation more commonly seen between politicians than civil servants. Larry was once spotted with a limp after reports that Palmerston had clawed him. But the two appeared to have repaired their relationship after Palmerston moved out of London. Last week, Larry joined the nation in mourning his old rival after a life of service for Queen, King and country. “Farewell old friend,” he wrote on social media.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Ukrainian and Russian officials began a new round of U.S.-brokered peace talks on Tuesday in Switzerland, though hopes of a breakthrough to end the war were low. Fighting rages on, past negotiations have produced little, and major hurdles to a deal are unresolved. The talks, which were held Tuesday afternoon and will run through Wednesday, were the third trilateral meeting between Ukrainian, Russian and American negotiators in roughly three weeks. Ukraine and Russia have described two previous rounds of discussions in the United Arab Emirates as productive. But those talks delivered scant progress beyond a prisoner-of-war exchange. The conflict will enter its fifth year later this month as Russia continues to strike Ukraine’s power grid , including in an attack on Tuesday involving nearly 40 missiles and 400 drones, according to the Ukrainian Air Force . Kyiv and Moscow are still far apart on the core obstacles to a peace deal: the fate of Ukrainian-held territory in the east that Russia wants — an issue expected to dominate this week’s talks — and the question of postwar Western security guarantees to deter another Russian invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine underscored those differences in social media posts on Monday, warning that it would be “a big mistake to allow the aggressor to take something” — an apparent reference to Russia’s demand for the eastern territories. He also urged the United States to advance work on security guarantees, which has been complicated by Moscow’s insistence that such guarantees must exclude Western troop deployments in Ukraine. Rustem Umerov, the head of the Ukrainian delegation and the secretary of the country’s National Security Council, published pictures on social media that showed him seated at a table with other Ukrainian officials, including Kyrylo Budanov , Mr. Zelensky’s chief of staff. To their right, according to the pictures, sat American mediators, including Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s special envoy; and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law. Both had just wrapped up talks focused on Iran that were also held in Geneva. Facing the Ukrainians was the Russian delegation, which included Vladimir Medinsky, a top Kremlin aide, as well as military intelligence figures, according to the pictures. The presence of Mr. Medinsky, a former culture minister and amateur historian who led negotiations for Moscow last year , has been seen by some in Ukraine as a discouraging signal. In previous talks, Mr. Medinsky grated on his Ukrainian counterparts with lengthy historical lectures and a hard-line stance, warning that Russia was prepared to keep fighting indefinitely.

Michel Euler/Associated Press Mr. Medinsky was absent from the two trilateral meetings this year in the United Arab Emirates, where Russia was represented by security and military intelligence officials — a shift that Ukrainian officials said helped improve the tone of the talks. “These are different people, and there were no more pseudohistorical lectures,” Andrii Sybiha, Ukraine’s foreign minister, told Ukrainian media last month after the first trilateral meeting. “The conversations were very focused.” Those meetings focused on the mechanics of a cease-fire and how it would be monitored by the United States, Mr. Zelensky told Bloomberg last week. They did not appear to address the bigger sticking points related to territorial issues and security guarantees — which analysts said may explain why the talks were described as constructive . Mr. Zelensky told Bloomberg that this week’s negotiations would most likely center on the territorial issue. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, confirmed as much on Monday in a call with reporters, adding that the change in focus had prompted the return of Mr. Medinsky as “the chief negotiator.” Officials from Britain, France, Germany and Italy also took part in Tuesday’s talks, though they were not expected to engage with the Russian delegation, according to a Kyiv-based European diplomat. European countries have largely been sidelined in the peace negotiations, even though the war is unfolding on their continent. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has insisted that the war would not end unless Ukraine cedes the portion of the eastern Donetsk region it still controls — roughly 2,000 square miles of land, about the size of Delaware. Mr. Zelensky has repeatedly said Russia’s territorial demand was a nonstarter. But he has signaled openness to compromise, suggesting a demilitarized zone in Donetsk where both Ukrainian and Russian troops would pull back from an equal portion of territory. Polls in Ukraine also show a growing acceptance of territorial concessions among a war-weary public. Russia has long asserted that its slow but steady advance on the battlefield means Ukraine would be better off agreeing to a deal that includes territorial concessions now, rather than having Kyiv lose land later in bloody fighting. Ukraine, by contrast, has sought to maximize the cost of Russia’s advance by inflicting as many casualties on its troops as possible. Counterattacks over the past week have allowed Ukrainian troops to regain some positions in the east along the Haichul River, which serves as a natural barrier to Russian advances, according to battlefield maps and military analysts. But Ukrainian officials said this month that the Trump administration was ramping up pressure on them to make concessions, in a push to end the war by early summer .

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Prosecutors in Austria said on Monday that they had filed terrorism and other charges against a 21-year-old man they said was a member of a terrorist group that was planning an attack on a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna in 2024. The suspect, who was not publicly identified, professed his allegiance to the Islamic State group online, prosecutors said. The attack was thwarted but worries over safety led to the cancellation of three shows the artist had planned in Austria. The main aim was to attack the concert, according to prosecutors, who also accused the man of downloading instructions from ISIS for a shrapnel bomb “specifically designed” for terror attacks. The suspect was charged with receiving instructions on handling and using the materials, the Vienna Public Prosecutor’s Office said . The man is also accused of having repeatedly tried to buy firearms and a hand grenade, and instructing illegal dealers to import the weapons into Austria. The suspect, who has been in custody since August 2024, faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted, prosecutors said. The initial tip about a threat against Ms. Swift’s concerts came from American intelligence , Austrian officials have said. The shows were part of Ms. Swift’s Eras tour, and had been expected to draw tens of thousands of fans. The threat followed deadly attacks on concert halls. In 2015, an ISIS attack on a Paris concert hall and other sites killed 130 people , and in 2017, an attack on an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, killed at least 22 people . The bomber in the Manchester attack, who died in the assault, had links to ISIS . Prosecutors in Germany last year charged a Syrian teenager living in Germany with helping plot the thwarted Vienna concert attack. In that case, prosecutors accused the teenager, whom they identified only as Mohammad A. in keeping with privacy rules, of helping interpret Arabic-language bomb-building instructions and of translating an oath of allegiance to ISIS for the main suspect in the Austria plot. The teen was about 14 years old when the plot was thwarted, and he was convicted and given an 18-month suspended sentence under juvenile criminal law. Christopher F. Schuetze contributed reporting.

      "content": "The Syrian Army has moved into vast new regions, seeking to erase the largest fissure left from the civil war. They have encountered a land in desperate need and deeply divided after years of fighting. The advance has left ethnic Kurds fearful and wary. It has dashed their dream of autonomy in northeastern Syria. Their lingering defiance may point to challenges ahead. The mood was tense as government forces entered the city of Hasakah in northeastern Syria this month. U.S.-led coalition warplanes flew overhead, and a Syrian Army unit monitored the column’s progress from drones, watching for ambush by Kurdish groups. It was the first time the government was moving into Hasakah, a stronghold of the Kurds for more than a decade, and its presence was not welcomed by all. Kurdish soldiers, who are being made to abandon their ambition for an autonomous region, remained defiant, parading with Kurdish flags and weapons before a government base. The display indicated the challenges ahead for President Ahmed al-Sharaa. Benefiting from a switch in American support away from the Kurds, he has used a mixture of muscle and negotiation in recent weeks to take over three provinces of eastern Syria. The vast, resource-rich region had eluded his grasp since his rebel force toppled the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad just over a year ago. His new government is now extending its authority, advancing toward its goal of unifying Syria for the first time in 15 years. The task before him is daunting. Already stretched with stabilizing the war-battered country and lifting its people out of poverty, the government now has a huge new area of territory to secure and rebuild.

During a two-week long journey across the newly opened territory, our reporting team encountered a land in desperate need and deeply divided after years of civil conflict. The Kurds, a minority in Syria, are the dominant population in parts of northeast Syria, and they were by turns wary, resistant and resigned at the prospect of rule from Damascus. Arab residents, who had chafed under the rule of the Kurdish-led force, the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., were celebratory. Some had rushed back to reclaim their homes, even as army units were clearing mines and booby traps left by departing Kurdish forces. “The entire village was displaced in 2013,” said Ahmed al-Ahmad, 40, who had returned from Lebanon and was repairing his house in the village of Al Belasha, in the newly controlled areas of Aleppo province. “Not even a bird could fly here.” The infrastructure demands are immense. The area’s hydroelectric dams, oil fields and rich farming land are debilitated. Much of the countryside lies in darkness. Cities are strewed with trash. Power is so intermittent that neighborhoods roar with the sound of generators. In the provincial capital of Raqqa, cars bumped through potholes filled with muddy rainwater.

Security forces were still searching underground tunnels for explosives and S.D.F. stragglers, said Ahmed Adel, the acting head of the government’s Internal Security forces in Raqqa. “Once we have security,” Mr. Adel said, “we can sort out everything else.” Government officials said they have learned from the experience of taking over the rest of the country after the fall of the Assad regime in December 2024.

Government delegations have been arriving from Damascus to assess the region’s needs, but residents are already complaining about rising gas prices. With the departure of the S.D.F., thousands who had built an economy linked to the force and its administration were now without jobs. In northeastern Syria, the S.D.F. was more than a fighting force but a veritable government of its own. It had been the main ally working with U.S. forces in the area for more than a decade in combating the terrorist group Islamic State and guarding thousands of ISIS prisoners. The Kurds had long wanted their own autonomous region there. But in recent weeks, the Trump administration withdrew its support from the Kurds and threw it behind Mr. al-Sharaa in his aim to unite Syria under his rule. Some Kurds saw the shift as a betrayal. Without American backing, the Kurdish force could not hold their neighborhoods in the city of Aleppo, and had little hope of controlling the mainly Arab populated provinces of Raqqa and Deir al Zour. Some Kurdish fighters in Aleppo chose to make a last stand. After days of fighting, the bulk of the fighters and their political leaders withdrew to Hasakah, a largely Kurdish region. The government has now entered there, too. Image Mines collected from recently captured territory, near the Tishreen Dam.

Image Billboards honoring Kurdish fighters killed during the battle for the Sheikh Maqsoud neighborhood in Aleppo and leaders of the Kurdish struggle across the region. People living in the mainly Arab populated provinces wrested from the S.D.F. complained that the Kurdish-led force had run a harsh police state. “We were always in fear they would raid our shop. We knew anyone could charge us with being an ISIS fighter,” said Belal Bargash, 32, standing outside his cellphone shop in a part of Deir al Zour province that had been controlled by the Kurdish-led force. “We feel extremely relieved,” he said, breaking into a beaming smile. Some Kurds in the region said that they, too, had felt oppressed by the S.D.F.’s administration. Ayman Lolak, 43, a Kurdish businessman in the Sheikh Maqsoud neighborhood of Aleppo, which the S.D.F. had lost, said he was pleased finally to be reconnected to the rest of the city and to the central government. He said the Kurdish administration had confiscated his line of shops and other properties near the front line and allowed him only the use of one shop and one house. “We were under a blockade for the last year,” he said. “Now it’s open and we can import and export goods.” Image Local residents on the formerly S.D.F.-controlled side of the Euphrates River, opposite Deir al Zour.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Just about everyone close to Tshephiso Marumo condemned her when she chose to sell ears of corn door-to-door a decade ago after earning an honors degree from a university in her native Botswana. It was the sort of thing that people in the southern African nation looked down upon as poor people’s work, not something for a sophisticated graduate with dreams of becoming a journalist. One of her former professors was so dismayed that he derisively nicknamed her Mmammidi, a Setswana term that roughly translates to Corn Lady. Ms. Marumo, 33, shrugged off the criticism and has since turned that humble beginning into what many people in Botswana call a tale of triumph and inspiration: She has opened two roadside food stalls in the capital, Gaborone, that have become a hit, selling traditional village cooking that you almost never find in urban areas. Her venture has turned the unglamorous work of roadside food vending into something fashionable, earning her a large social media following and prominent customers, including politicians, musicians and influencers. Video Food being prepared in Ms. Marumo’s backyard. Yet the same qualities that have aided Ms. Marumo’s rise — persistence, candor and stubbornness — have also made her a divisive figure. The more prominent she has become, the louder she has spoken out online about hot-button issues, like parenting and drug addiction, earning her a reputation among some as a social media bully. On Facebook , one of Botswana’s primary social media platforms, Ms. Marumo has more than 240,000 followers, the equivalent of nearly 10 percent of Botswana’s population. She called the business Mmammidi, after the former professor’s nickname, and plastered it onto T-shirts, aprons and two company cars. “There are so many things I have done, but they have never given me a brand or a name or an identity,” she said. “But through the corn, I got an identity.” Ms. Marumo likes to say she sparked controversy even before she was born. Her mother became pregnant with her as a teenager, upsetting many family members. Growing up, Ms. Marumo bounced between Gaborone, where her mother worked as a police officer, and Kalamare, a village three hours away where she stayed with her grandmother. Her grandmother ran an illegal tavern out of their home, something that was frowned upon in the community. But Ms. Marumo said she had no shame in the family business because she was always well taken care of. Her grandmother taught her how to cook, and that interest grew when she took home economics in school. Image Ms. Marumo makes traditional food, including a shredded beef dish known as seswaa and bogobe jwa lerotse, a thick porridge of sorghum and melon juice. Ms. Marumo started her cooking business after building a following with her corn sales. She began hosting dinners at her home, cooking Tswana food in the traditional style — in three-legged cast iron pots over a wood-fired flame. The dishes are seasoned mostly with just salt and natural fats, a traditional technique meant to bring out the true flavors of the meats, starches and vegetables. Her dinners became so popular, she said, that in late 2019 she cleared out a bushy field at a busy intersection near her home and set up her first food stall. Offering village cooking on a street corner near Gaborone’s central business district, Ms. Marumo’s enterprise was a welcome departure for many locals from the usual fare of westernized food showered in spices served up by chain restaurants. “I’m passionate about my heritage, where I’m from and what my ancestors consumed before me,” a satisfied Orebotse Makgolo, 37, said after eating at Ms. Marumo’s stall for the first time recently. “Unfortunately, we consume a lot of western food, and it’s always nice to be in touch with the local side of yourself.” In January, Ms. Marumo opened a second food stall. Both are unfussy stands made of wood with flat, tin-sheet roofs sitting on dirt lots. She now employs 11 workers. They come to her modest bungalow every morning at 6, where they fire up about 30 pots under a shelter in the backyard, cooking the day’s menu in a swirl of heat and eye-burning smoke. The result on a recent day was a spread that included a shredded beef dish known as seswaa , a similar version mixed with tripe called mokoto and bogobe jwa lerotse , a thick porridge of sorghum and melon juice. Image Ms. Marumo’s dinners became so popular that in late 2019, she cleared out a bushy field at a busy intersection near her home and set up her first food stall. Two years ago, Ms. Marumo ventured into a new enterprise, holding the first of what she said would be annual women’s empowerment seminars. But given her reputation as an online bully, many are unconvinced that Ms. Marumo is a true champion of women. On social media, she has criticized how some mothers raise their children and questioned the wisdom of some people’s decision to have children in the first place. Online commenters have, in turn, attacked Ms. Marumo with negative comments about her body. They have criticized her food as “soily,” meaning it tastes like dirt. Thato San, a Botswana native who owns a beauty brand, said she was shocked last year when Ms. Marumo suggested online that Ms. San may have been complicit in the drug addiction of one of her friends, a rapper who had recently died. Just months earlier, Ms. San said, she had nominated Ms. Marumo for special recognition at a Women’s Month brunch. “It was disappointing because I looked up to her,” she said. “Her presence on social media, a lot of people would say is very, very negative.” Ms. Marumo argues that she is misunderstood and that her words are often twisted. Her success, she said, had bred contempt and made people feel that they could say anything about her. She feels compelled to speak about women’s issues because of her own experience overcoming doubters, she said. Mothers often contact her for help with their children, and she has volunteered with and raised funds for an orphanage — experiences that Ms. Marumo said have given her a motherly instinct, even though she does not have children of her own. “I am known by many people, but I’m still human,” she said. “I want my freedom. I need my freedom of expression.” Image Enjoying lunch hour at one of the stalls. Ms. Marumo started her cooking business after building a following with her corn sales. Since college, Ms. Marumo has always done things her way, said Benah Sekgabo, who met her in 2011 when they studied together. Ms. Marumo had a unique hairstyle and would design her own shoes, earrings and clothes, saying that she couldn’t buy the same off-the-rack items as her classmates. The social media controversies don’t seem to have hurt business, so far. For some, Ms. Marumo’s brashness is part of her appeal. “She’s a very confident person,” said Losika Mooketsi, a 20-year-old accounting student as she tucked into a plate of Ms. Marumo’s stewed meat. “She doesn’t let anyone bring her down. People can start rumors about her, and she won’t let that faze her.” Behind the steely exterior, though, Ms. Marumo said the withering criticism can be painful. She starts each day reading the Bible and writing motivational messages on sticky notes, which now form a colorful collage on her bedroom door. “Pray for those who have caused me pain,” reads one note. “Thank you God for P1,000,000,” says another, a reference to her goal of earning at least a million Pula (about $76,000), which she said she was still working toward. And then there’s one from a popular Psalm that might sum up her approach to life: “I will fear no evil.” Image Ms. Marumo. “I am known by many people, but I’m still human,” she said. “I want my freedom.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT An architect of Virginia’s aggressive redistricting scheme will announce on Wednesday that he intends to run for one of the newly drawn Democratic seats himself. Dan Helmer, a four-term state delegate who played a key behind-the-scenes role in last October’s surprise move to redraw Virginia’s congressional maps , is entering the race for the lobster-shaped Seventh Congressional District that will be created if voters approve a constitutional amendment to allow for mid-decade redistricting. A top ally to Don Scott, the Virginia House speaker, Mr. Helmer served as campaigns chairman for the Virginia House Democratic Caucus as the party took control of the chamber in 2023 and then flipped 13 more Republican-held seats last November. Last fall, Mr. Helmer helped devise and implement the redistricting strategy and then marshaled support in Richmond for the first set of votes on the amendment to redraw congressional maps. He later recused himself from the map-drawing process. “We need fighters with a proven track record of not just standing up but winning against Donald Trump and the Republican Congress to get our country back in the right direction,” Mr. Helmer said in an interview. “I’m a progressive fighter with an unmatched record of taking on Trump and winning.” The Seventh is one of four new districts likely to favor Democrats that would be created if Virginia voters pass the redistricting amendment on April 21. It begins at the Potomac River in Arlington and stretches west to the West Virginia border in one lobster claw and south past Richmond to rural Powhatan County, in the other. Vice President Kamala Harris won 54 percent of the vote there in 2024, and Joseph R. Biden Jr. took 56 percent in 2020. An Army veteran of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Mr. Helmer, 44, entered state politics in 2019 on a platform of gun control and abortion rights. He flipped the last Republican-held state House seat in Fairfax County, a Washington suburb that was then in the final stages of a transition from Republican territory to one that now votes for Democrats by large margins. Mr. Helmer is the second Democrat to enter the race, following J.P. Cooney, a top deputy to Jack Smith , the special prosecutor who twice indicted Mr. Trump. Image J.P. Cooney announced his candidacy last week. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times While Mr. Cooney, a career federal prosecutor, is a relative newcomer to Virginia politics, Mr. Helmer has run for Northern Virginia congressional seats twice before, losing in Democratic primaries in 2018 and 2024 . He has built a political base in Fairfax County and among the state’s power brokers in Richmond. Mr. Helmer enters the race with endorsements from former Gov. Ralph Northam; 43 of Virginia’s 84 other Democratic state legislators; and Representative Eugene Vindman, a Virginia Democrat whose current district covers much of the territory Mr. Helmer seeks to represent. “Dan Helmer delivered the largest Democratic majority in four decades,” Mr. Scott, the Virginia House speaker, said. “He whipped Virginia Republicans — Republicans in D.C. should be trembling in their orthopedic shoes.” Though Mr. Helmer helped to whip votes for the constitutional amendment last fall, he said he was not involved in drawing the proposed new maps, an assertion confirmed by several people involved. Still, there was a widespread belief among Virginia Democrats as the new maps were being debated that a new Democratic seat would be drawn for Mr. Helmer. Mr. Helmer said his primary role in drawing the new maps was leading the party’s campaign committee in the House of Delegates to elect new Democrats to the chamber. “There are 17 Republican-held seats that are now held by Democrats,” Mr. Helmer said. “That has allowed us to put redistricting in front of the people, and I’m convinced they will allow us to enact new maps.” Reid J.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Democrats knew in real time last year that they had bungled their response to President Trump’s address to a joint session of Congress, making themselves a distraction rather than offering a cohesive message of resistance to his policies. Representative Al Green, a liberal septuagenarian from Texas, was ejected from the chamber (and later censured) after disrupting the speech with a cane-waving tirade . The paddles that some Democrats waved with short messages on them — “Save Medicaid,” “Musk Steals” and one that just read “False” — were widely panned as a hokey and incoherent response. It was all out of step with the sober, centrist counter to Mr. Trump that party leaders had wanted to project that night. They’re trying something different on Tuesday, when Mr. Trump is scheduled to deliver the first State of the Union address of his second term. A substantial number of Democrats are planning to boycott the speech and attend an alternative event, a rally called the “People’s State of the Union,” which will take place on the National Mall near the Capitol. The event, which is being coordinated by the left-wing advocacy group MoveOn and MeidasTouch, a progressive media company, will feature Democratic lawmakers speaking with people who have been negatively affected by Mr. Trump’s economic and health care policies, as well as federal workers who lost their jobs and immigrants who have been targeted by the Trump administration. It will be hosted by the liberal political commentators Joy Reid and Katie Phang. “He’s made a mockery of the State of the Union speech and he doesn’t deserve an audience,” Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said of Mr. Trump in an interview, explaining why he planned to attend the rally instead of the speech. “He’s going to tell 40 different lies, call Democrats names; he’s going to paper over his corruption; and I don’t feel like what he’s doing dignifies having Democrats there to cloak the speech in a veneer of respectability.” Mr. Murphy, who also skipped the address last year, added: “These aren’t normal times, and we have to stop doing normal things.” Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, attended Mr. Trump’s speech last year but walked out before the end. (Last year, the president spoke for roughly 100 minutes.) This year, Mr. Van Hollen said, he won’t be going. “We cannot normalize this moment when Trump is marching our country toward fascism,” said Mr. Van Hollen, who will also speak at the rally. “I refuse to be a prop in the chamber as Donald Trump shreds our Constitution and attacks our democracy.” Image Representative Al Green yelled in protest as Mr. Trump addressed Congress last year. Credit... Kenny Holston/The New York Times It is unclear how many Democratic members of Congress will attend the speech. Some have expressed concern that boycotting en masse would leave Mr. Trump with a purely sycophantic audience. But even a sizable boycott would break with a tradition, which most Democrats adhered to even through the first Trump administration, of the opposing party dutifully sitting through a speech they mostly disagree with. Even when they registered their disapproval with acts of protest — like when former Speaker Nancy Pelosi ripped up Mr. Trump’s speech when he was finished delivering it — they mostly showed up. Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and minority leader, has encouraged members to either sit silently through the speech or boycott it altogether, rather than attend and create distractions in the House chamber. Mr. Jeffries on Tuesday said it was his “present intention” to attend. “We’re not going to his house, he’s coming to our house,” he told reporters at a news conference. “Having grown up where I grew up, you never let anyone run you off your block.” (Mr. Jeffries grew up in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn.) Lawmakers who are skipping the speech for the rally so far include Senators Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts and Tina Smith of Minnesota, as well as House Democrats including Representatives Becca Balint of Vermont, Greg Casar of Texas, Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Delia Ramirez of Illinois. Another contingent of lawmakers is expected to walk out of the address while Mr. Trump is speaking and make their way to the competing event. “We know that he is going to use the State of the Union to mislead the American people and lie,” said Sara Haghdoosti, the chief of program at MoveOn Civic Action. “We want to make sure we’re focusing on the impact his horrendous policies have had. We want to shift the focus from Trump’s lies to the stories of people.” Annie Karni is a congressional correspondent for The Times.

Image Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, during a Senate hearing last Thursday. Credit... Eric Lee for The New York Times The White House on Tuesday rejected the latest offer from Democratic lawmakers on proposed new constraints on federal immigration officers, the latest sign that there would not be a quick resolution of the stalemate that has left the Department of Homeland Security without funding since Saturday. A White House official who provided a statement on the condition of anonymity to describe private negotiations said the two parties were still far apart, adding that President Trump’s team remained interested in continuing good-faith talks to resolve the impasse. In response, aides for the Democratic leaders in Congress said that Republicans had largely ignored the guardrails the public was demanding, and urged them to start negotiating in good faith as they said their side had been doing. Both White House officials and Democrats on Capitol Hill have kept largely confidential the specifics of their offers to end the standoff that allowed funding for the agency to lapse as of 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The outlines of the Democratic demands, however, are well known: limits on masked police, an end to random sweeps, new requirements for judicial warrants, putting “sensitive locations” such as churches, schools, hospitals and polling places off limits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement among them. The offer was given to the White House Monday evening but brushed aside by the White House less than 24 hours later. “These are common sense,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said Sunday on CNN about the Democratic proposals. “Police departments across America use them. We have a rogue agency. Why don’t we rein them in? That’s what the American people are asking Republicans.” Democrats have portrayed the earlier White House counteroffer to Democrats, which has not been made public, as “nonserious.” People familiar with the talks have said that the White House has not been responsive to many of the Democratic demands for limits on federal immigration agents, and has pushed for new authority of its own, including increased penalties for those who dox officers. Some Republicans have also said that they want an end to local and state policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, sometimes called sanctuary city policies, in exchange for concessions. “When it comes to masks, I don’t know of another law enforcement agency in the country that has an 8,000-percent increase in threats,” Tom Homan, President Trump’s border czar, said Sunday on CBS News’s “Face the Nation.” “Just yesterday, the director of ICE, his wife was filmed walking to work. His home address has been doxed. His kids have been doxed and filmed.” With Congress on a weeklong recess and lawmakers scattered around the world and the nation, chances for approval of a funding agreement this week remained remote since members would have to return to Washington to pass it and the negotiations were not showing any movement. Democrats made clear they intended to stick to their demands and did not appear to be uneasy about any political backlash for blocking money for the agency that also funds airport security, the Coast Guard and disaster relief. “We need change that is dramatic, that is bold, that is meaningful and that is transformational,” Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the House minority leader, said on CBS. “For instance, judicial warrants should be required before ICE agents can storm private property or rip everyday Americans out of their homes.” Many of the Department of Homeland Security’s workers remain on the job but run the risk of missing a paycheck if the funding fight drags on. Mr. Trump is scheduled to deliver the first formal State of the Union address of his second term before Congress next Tuesday. Without some breakthrough, he will make the speech before Congress with one agency without a congressional appropriation for the year, though ICE has a separate pot of money from an earlier measure that can keep it operating.

Credit Credit... Valentin Flauraud/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Indirect talks between American and Iranian officials in Switzerland ended on Tuesday with an agreement on a “set of guiding principles,” according to Iran’s foreign minister, who said both sides had agreed to exchange drafts on a potential deal. The foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, was as positive as he was vague, providing little clarity on what had been discussed or when the next round of discussions might be held. American officials did not immediately comment publicly on the talks, but one U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations, said the two sides had made progress. The official said the Iranians would provide more detailed proposals in the next two weeks to address some of the gaps between the United States and Iran, but did not provide any specifics. Mr. Araghchi told Iranian state television that the talks, which were held in Geneva and lasted about three hours, had been “more constructive” and had made “good progress” compared with a previous round of negotiations in Oman this month. “We now have a clear path ahead, which in my view is positive,” he said. But Mr. Araghchi said a deal was not imminent, as the Middle East remained on edge over the possibility of an American attack should negotiations collapse. Iran has insisted that the talks be strictly limited to its nuclear program, even as U.S. officials have said they would push to curb the range of Iran’s ballistic missiles and its support of militias across the region. Mr. Araghchi did not address those points in his comments to Iranian state television, saying only that the two sides had reached a “general understanding on a set of guiding principles” to continue discussions and to “move toward drafting the text of a possible agreement.” “This does not mean that we can reach an agreement quickly, but at least the path has begun,” he said. Three Iranian officials familiar with the talks said that Iran had indicated a willingness to suspend nuclear enrichment for three to five years — which would cover the duration of Mr. Trump’s presidency — and then join a regional consortium for civilian grade enrichment. Iran would also dilute its stockpile of uranium on its own soil in the presence of international inspectors. In exchange, Iran has demanded that the United States lift financial and banking sanctions and the embargo on its oil sales. The officials, who asked not to be identified to discuss sensitive negotiations, said Iran was also dangling financial incentives and opportunities for investments and trade with the United States, including in Iran’s oil and energy sectors. The negotiations were hosted at the Omani ambassador’s residence by Oman’s foreign minister, Badr Albusaidi, who mediated the previous round of talks. A spokesman for Iran’s foreign ministry said ahead of the talks that Omani officials would shuttle between the two sides. Mr. Albusaidi said on social media after the talks that they had concluded “with good progress towards identifying common goals and relevant technical issues.” “Together we made serious efforts to define a number of guiding principles for a final deal,” he added.",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday released its final report on the midair collision near Ronald Reagan National Airport last year that killed 67 people, as the House announced plans to vote next week on legislation to address some of the institutional failures that investigators said led to the accident. The 419-page document , which brings the board’s intense scrutiny of the accident to a close, did not contain any bombshell revelations, as the board detailed its findings and recommendations late last month. But its presentation of how missed warnings, institutional failures and human errors serve as a detailed and at times devastating account of the episode, which the safety board’s chairwoman, Jennifer Homendy, has said was “100 percent preventable.” The report’s recommendations also serve as a list of action items for aviation safety advocates, who have been pushing for some of the advised changes since long before the crash. But it will be up to Congress and federal agencies whether to implement any of the recommendations. In Congress, the Senate has passed a bipartisan bill to compel the Federal Aviation Administration to conduct safety reviews of airports, and require planes flying through busy airspace to have advanced location tracking technology. That would address two of the key factors that the N.T.S.B. identified in its findings about what caused an Army Black Hawk helicopter to fly into American Airlines Flight 5342 on the night of Jan. 29, without any of the pilots realizing they were on a collision course until barely more than a second before they crashed. But in the House, Representative Sam Graves of Missouri, the Republican chairman of that chamber’s transportation committee, has resisted pressure to advance the legislation. Justin Harclerode, a spokesman for the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said in a statement on Tuesday that the Republican and Democratic leaders of that panel and the one overseeing armed services were “working expeditiously on a comprehensive bill to address the range of issues identified by the N.T.S.B.’s now complete investigation.” He added that the House would soon move forward with its own legislation. Nonetheless, on Tuesday afternoon, following the release of the N.T.S.B. report, House leaders announced plans to put the legislation passed by the Senate to a vote as soon as Monday, with no changes. Two-thirds of the House will have to support the legislation in order for it to pass. During a hearing last week to review the N.T.S.B.’s findings, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Senate committee overseeing transportation, maintained that the bill would “begin to protect the flying public now, which is why the House should pass it and put it on the president’s desk.” Image Family members of those killed in the accident attended a hearing last week that reviewed the N.T.S.B.’s findings on the crash. Credit... Elizabeth Frantz for The New York Times The F.A.A. and the Army have so far not committed to implementing extensive new recommendations the N.T.S.B. approved late last month. Last year, however, the F.A.A. did heed the N.T.S.B.’s recommendations to redirect helicopter traffic around the airport and drastically limit the number of aircraft allowed to pass through the airspace without broadcasting their location to other planes. It implemented the changes just days after the board requested them. “Since Secretary Duffy took office, he and the F.A.A. have taken decisive steps to correct past failures, strengthen accountability and modernize” the national airspace, the F.A.A. said in a statement, referring to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. “Today, we are acting proactively to mitigate risks before they affect the traveling public.” The Army did not respond to a request for comment. The relationship between the F.A.A. and Army has been strained as the aviation safety agency tries to regulate the movements of military aircraft through busy airspace and the military presses to relax the restrictions. In the last week, those tensions were exacerbated by a standoff in El Paso. The F.A.A. temporarily restricted all flights under 18,000 feet there after U.S. Customs and Border Protection, using a high-energy counter-drone laser on loan from the Pentagon, shot down a metallic balloon. The F.A.A. had not yet approved plans to deploy the technology, permission that is required by law. In its final report, the N.T.S.B. issued eight recommendations to the Army. Most of them were directed at training military aviators about the challenges of flying near Reagan National, the limitations of the equipment on board their aircraft, and the collection and assessment of flight safety data. But the bulk of the N.T.S.B.’s new recommendations — 33 of them — were directed at the F.A.A., which board members faulted for poor airport design at Reagan National, ignoring multiple warnings about the potential for collisions. The board also described a culture within the F.A.A. that caused controllers to become accustomed to overwork that sometimes detracted from their ability to closely monitor flights coming dangerously close to one another. On the night of the accident on Jan. 29, 2025, one controller was handling both airplane and helicopter traffic — a double load that the N.T.S.B. found was unnecessary because the control tower at Reagan National had enough staff on hand to avoid it. The board also determined that the controller gave the helicopter pilots too much latitude to manage their own flight through the congested airspace around Reagan National, and never warned the commercial jet pilots to keep an eye out for the Army Black Hawk headed their way. The board also stressed that mandating the use of more advanced location tracking technology — a recommendation it has made as part of multiple aviation accident investigations — could have given the pilots a chance to avoid hitting each other in the contorted airspace around Reagan National, even without the guidance of a controller.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT By the early afternoon on Tuesday, mourners had left around half a dozen bouquets of flowers and a few balloons outside of the Rev. Jesse Jackson’s Tudor-style house on Constance Avenue in the South Shore neighborhood. Next door, Junelle Speller said she had bought her home because she fell in love with the house, but living beside Mr. Jackson was a wonderful bonus. “It was always surreal for us to be living next door to a civil rights icon, someone my husband and I both studied in school here in Chicago,” Mrs. Speller said. Despite Mr. Jackson’s larger-than-life persona and soaring oratory skills, Mrs. Speller soon discovered that in person the civil rights leader “was very grounded, very down to earth, approachable, personable and vibrant.” “He had a deliberate but very inspirational way of speaking,” she said. “You’d be kind of awestruck. But he was at your level, meeting you and sharing those stories, providing motivation for this period of time, for the African American community.” Anita O’Neal, 67, stopped by the Jackson home and showed reporters gathered outside the house a wrinkled photo of herself from 1968. She was 11 years old in the picture, wearing a prim, white outfit for a flight from Chicago to Cape Girardeau, Mo. Sitting in a seat and looking up at her is a young Mr. Jackson, who at the time was a protégé of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Ms. O’Neal said she had come to appreciate the experience only later on in life. “I read about who he was and understood who he was. It was quite an honor for me,” she said. Image Anita O’Neal shows a photo of herself with Jesse Jackson when she was 11 years old. Credit... Nam Y. Huh/Associated Press Ms. O’Neal recalled Mr. Jackson’s quieter side. When he would attend services at St. Sabina Church in the Auburn Gresham neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side, he wouldn’t draw attention to himself, she said. “He wouldn’t come with fanfare,” she said. “He would just walk in, walk down the center aisle, and just go on and sit down.” The pastor, Michael L. Pfleger, would introduce him, she recalled, but Mr. Jackson “didn’t want any recognition. He was there for service.” Joy Jones, 66, said she had come straight to Mr. Jackson’s house after working an overnight shift at a hospital in the Bronzeville neighborhood on the city’s South Side. Still dressed in her purple scrubs, Ms. Jones said she hoped someone would follow in Mr. Jackson’s footsteps just as Mr. Jackson picked up Mr. King’s fight for civil rights after his assassination. “I’m praying that someone will stand up and will continue the movement forward,” Ms. Jones said. “Because it seems this administration is trying to make us take some steps backward, but I really hope that someone — male, female, someone — will stand up and say, ‘We’ve got to keep moving. We’ve got to keep going.’” Among the other Chicagoans who dropped by to pay their respects was Delores Brown, who set down a bouquet of flowers next to the small shrine that had been growing on the Jackson family’s front lawn. He had been a role model, she said, for people in the South Side community where she lived, especially for young Black men. “He’s also been a person that has spoken for us on so many levels when we were not able to speak for ourselves,” she said.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The Rev. Jesse Jackson’s death comes at a moment when Black voters are hugely influential within the Democratic Party and there are more Black senators than ever before — yet the future of Black representation in the House of Representatives is uncertain. The Supreme Court is set to rule in the coming months on a case that will determine the fate of a key provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the federal law that undergirds Southern Black representation in the House. In arguments last fall, the conservative-leaning court seemed skeptical of a key provision of the law, a signature achievement of the civil rights era. Black voters overwhelmingly support the Democratic Party, despite President Trump’s notable gains with them in 2024, and some Democrats and Black faith leaders argue that the country is going backward on civil rights. “We are witnessing right now in real time the kind of attack on voting rights that really does harken back to the darkest days of the civil rights struggle,” Senator Raphael Warnock, a Georgia Democrat and the pastor of the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, said on Tuesday. “I owe it to Rev. Jackson, and we owe it to the next generation, to pass voting rights and ensure that we level the playing field so that every voice can be heard in our democracy.” Some conservatives say that decades of rising political power for Black Americans mean that old legal and policy interventions like the Voting Rights Act are no longer necessary. During oral arguments in the case in October, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said that “this court’s cases, in a variety of contexts, have said that race-based remedies are permissible for a period of time — sometimes for a long period of time, decades in some cases — but that they should not be indefinite, and should have an end point.” Image President Lyndon B. Johnson signing the Voting Rights Act in 1965 as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., center, looked on. Credit... Yoichi Okamoto/LBJ Presidential Library Some Black Republicans, however, have voiced support for the civil rights legislation. “I think the Voting Rights Act is very important — it’s an important part of our history,” Ben Carson, a housing secretary in the first Trump administration, said in an interview. “We should unite around that fact and not let ourselves be divided.” Mr. Carson, who said that he had met Mr. Jackson while still a surgeon and that the civil rights leader had been an early supporter of his books, added: “What’s necessary is that Americans have their voting rights protected, all Americans.” For Democrats, defending the voting rights of Black Americans is also about politics. The influence of Black voters in Democratic presidential primary contests is undeniable: In 2008, 2016 and 2020, Southern states where the primary electorates are dominated by Black voters swung heavily toward the party’s eventual nominees. In those primary races, Black voters in South Carolina and then across the South helped lift Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Joseph R. Biden Jr. to victory, thwarting Mrs. Clinton in her first run, Bernie Sanders and then Mr. Sanders again. Image Joseph R. Biden Jr. meeting supporters after winning the South Carolina Democratic primary race in 2020. His victory there propelled him to the party’s nomination. Credit... Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times In each case, Black voters were pragmatic, said Jaime Harrison, a former chairman of both the Democratic National Committee and the South Carolina Democratic Party, choosing a candidate they believed had the best chance of winning the general election. And now, before the order of states has been set for the 2028 primary contest, a parade of would-be White House hopefuls have made their way to South Carolina. Govs. Gavin Newsom of California and Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, Representative Ro Khanna of California and others have visited the state in recent months with an apparent eye on ingratiating themselves with its largely Black primary electorate. “You’ve seen it election cycle after election cycle,” Mr. Harrison said. “The Black vote has been determinative in the presidential primary. As the first domino falls in South Carolina, it falls the same way across the rest of the South.” Of the 11 Black people ever elected to the Senate , five are serving now: Mr. Booker, Mr. Warnock and Senators Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland and Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, both Democrats. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina is the lone Black Republican senator. Clockwise from top left: Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, Senator Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Senator Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland. The New York Times Ms. Alsobrooks said in an interview on Tuesday that there was “responsibility and pride” in knowing that she is part of the largest group of Black senators to ever serve together. She said the impact went beyond policies debated on the Senate floor. She recalled a day last summer when she arrived after having had her hair braided. “I went to walk onto the Senate floor, when one of the U.S. Capitol Police officers stopped me, and he was thrilled,” she said. “He said, ‘Can I please take a photo with you?’” She added, “He had been in that building for many years and said, ‘Do you know you’re the first person to have ever stepped on the floor of the United States Senate with your hair in braids?’” The provision before the Supreme Court, Section 2, prohibits election or voting practices that discriminate on the basis of race. That guidance has led to the creation of majority-minority districts that are meant to help voters of color elect candidates of their choice. If the court fully struck down the provision, Democrats could lose about a dozen majority-minority districts across the South, according to an analysis by The New York Times . Many of those seats are currently held by Black lawmakers. Even before the Supreme Court ruling arrives, several Republican-led states have already eliminated districts with Black House representatives during the nation’s current gerrymandering battle. In Texas, Representative Marc Veasey, a Democrat, announced he would not run for re-election after he was drawn out of his seat. Representative Al Green, another Democrat, was drawn out of his longtime district and will now run for a different seat in a March primary race . In North Carolina, Representative Don Davis will have a much more difficult re-election fight after the state redrew its maps in October . And in Missouri, a new map threatens the re-election chances of Representative Emanuel Cleaver, a Democrat who has spent 20 years in Congress and was the first Black mayor of Kansas City. This century, the Supreme Court has chipped away at the Voting Rights Act. In 2013, the court struck down another key provision , Section 5, which required states with a history of racial discrimination at the polls to obtain federal approval before changing voting laws. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote in the opinion that “things have changed dramatically” since the law’s adoption decades ago. During oral arguments on the current Voting Rights Act case, Hashim M. Mooppan, a principal deputy solicitor general in the Trump administration, said that many Black members of Congress now hailed from districts that were not majority-minority. “None of these positions is going to lead to there being no Black representation in Congress or anything remotely approaching that,” he said. But civil rights leaders contend that the legal erosion of the Voting Rights Act will hurt Black Americans’ political power. “So here we are, Jesse Jackson dies today, and we have less voting rights protection under the Voting Rights Act than we had on Aug. 6, 1965,” said Bishop William Barber II, a civil-rights leader.

Mr. Jackson, who was celebrated for his impassioned oratory and populist vision of a “rainbow coalition” of the poor and forgotten, picked up the mantle of Dr. King after his assassination in 1968. He ran for president twice , but he never achieved either the commanding moral stature of Dr. King or the ultimate political triumph attained by Mr. Obama. Tributes flowed in for Mr. Jackson , including from President Trump, who called him “a good man” and a “force of nature,” and former President Joseph R.

When he would attend services at St. Sabina Church in the Auburn Gresham neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side, he wouldn’t draw attention to himself, she said. “He wouldn’t come with fanfare,” she said. “He would just walk in, walk down the center aisle, and just go on and sit down.” The pastor, Michael L. Pfleger, would introduce him, she recalled, but Mr. Jackson “didn’t want any recognition. He was there for service.” Joy Jones, 66, said she had come straight to Mr. Jackson’s house after working an overnight shift at a hospital in the Bronzeville neighborhood on the city’s South Side. Still dressed in her purple scrubs, Ms. Jones said she hoped someone would follow in Mr. Jackson’s footsteps just as Mr. Jackson picked up Mr. King’s fight for civil rights after his assassination. “I’m praying that someone will stand up and will continue the movement forward,” Ms. Jones said. “Because it seems this administration is trying to make us take some steps backward, but I really hope that someone — male, female, someone — will stand up and say, ‘We’ve got to keep moving. We’ve got to keep going.’” Among the other Chicagoans who dropped by to pay their respects was Delores Brown, who set down a bouquet of flowers next to the small shrine that had been growing on the Jackson family’s front lawn. He had been a role model, she said, for people in the South Side community where she lived, especially for young Black men. “He’s also been a person that has spoken for us on so many levels when we were not able to speak for ourselves,” she said.

Vest for The New York Times The museum at the Lorraine Motel was closed, typical for a Tuesday. Yet on a cloudy Memphis day, with a cold wind whipping the flags lowered to half-staff, there were still a few people who came to pay their respects outside. On this day, it was not just about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whose assassination on a balcony at the motel on April 4, 1968, defined the city in American history. For at least a couple of visitors, it was a chance to mourn the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who died at 84 on Tuesday and was among the people who witnessed the murder and sought to carry on Dr. King’s civil rights legacy. “I had to be there,” said Theresa Jackson, 56, who had pulled over Tuesday morning, on her way back to Illinois from Biloxi, Miss. Visiting the motel, which is now home to the National Civil Rights Museum , “gave me chills, just the presence of being there.” Across the South, leaders mourned the death of Mr. Jackson, who was born in South Carolina and crisscrossed the region campaigning for civil rights, championing voter registration and making two unsuccessful bids for the presidency. But in Memphis, where Mr. Jackson returned again and again to the site of Dr. King’s assassination, there was a unique grief over the loss of an elder who had inspired the city’s next generation of Black leaders. “He was a fixture,” Mayor Paul Young said in an interview on Tuesday, recounting how as a young student, he voted for Mr. Jackson in a mock presidential election because “he was somebody I could see myself in, that looked like me.” He met Mr. Jackson at the 2024 Democratic National Convention, Mr. Young recalled, and they had a conversation that was both “personal and meaningful.” “I get to serve as mayor today,” Mr. Young said, “tied to the ground that he broke.” Mr. Jackson embodied the connection between Chicago, where he lived, and Memphis, a familiar stop for many Black Americans traveling north. “He almost was sort of like a son of Memphis in many ways,” said State Representative Justin Pearson, who represents Memphis in the Tennessee General Assembly and received a phone call from Mr. Jackson in 2023 after Mr. Pearson’s colleagues had expelled him from the chamber over a gun control protest. “His connection to our city is obviously deeply rooted in sort of the grief of that loss of Dr. King, but also in this desire and willingness to see our city thrive, to become a better place,” Mr. Pearson added. Mr. Jackson built a partnership with Stax Records , a prominent Memphis institution , spreading his message as a signed, spoken-word recording artist. He spoke at churches and schools, stopped at the occasional barbecue j",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Long before the Rev. Jesse Jackson cemented his legacy as a civil-rights leader in struggles across the country and the world, he was a young boy growing up in Greenville, S.C., in an extremely segregated and poor part of the South that would shape his understanding of race in America. It was a place that Mr. Jackson often invoked in speeches. At the 1988 Democratic National Convention in Atlanta, he described how he was born “in a three-room house, bathroom in the backyard, slop jar by the bed, no hot and cold running water.” He was “born in the slum,” he told the audience, “but the slum was not born in me.” On Tuesday, residents in Greenville reflected on those humble beginnings as they learned of Mr. Jackson’s death at the age of 84 . “He is our son,” said Davida Mathis, a lawyer and activist whose father coached Mr. Jackson in football at Sterling High School. “He was our superstar.” As he grew older, Mr. Jackson turned into a studious, strong and extremely confident “super boy,” neighbors said, someone who ignored coaches’ drawn-up plays as quarterback, who ran errands for neighbors on his bike, and who wrote in yearbooks that he would one day be president — never mind that in the 1950s, it was illegal for him to even sit in the front of a bus. Greenville was also the place that kick-started his involvement in civil rights. In the summer of 1960, when Mr. Jackson was not yet 20 years old, he helped lead a march with seven other Black students at the Greenville public library that had denied him access. And in 2002, when he learned that Greenville County did not acknowledge Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a paid holiday, he flew there every few weeks to petition the local government to begin honoring it. When that didn’t work, he helped organize a march. And after that, he and his allies backed Republican primary candidates who promised to vote for the holiday. Those candidates won, and the county now closes for business on that day. “He’s one of ours who’s done good, and I think that gets overlooked, especially in conversations about the South and activism,” said Avery Allen, a Greenville native who knew Mr. Jackson her entire life. Ken Gibson, a member of the Greenville City Council who knew Mr. Jackson well, described him on Tuesday as “a phenomenal individual.” “He had the most fantastic presence, and he just filled a room,” said Mr. Gibson, whose parents were civil-rights activists with the N.A.A.C.P. in the early 1960s. Still, residents say that Greenville’s celebration of Mr. Jackson feels more muted than in other cities in the South that have birthed titans of the Civil Rights era. In Birmingham, Ala., for example, the city’s airport is named after Fred Shuttlesworth, a Black leader who survived beatings and bombings. At North Carolina A&T University — which Mr. Jackson attended — there is a monument dedicated to the four students who sat down at the segregated lunch counter of the Woolworth’s store.

Nick Madigan But in Greenville, S.C., there is no major street, historical marker or monument dedicated to Mr. Jackson, residents noted. Several years ago, there was an effort to preserve his childhood home on Haynie Street as a historical site. But the project fizzled after the councilwoman who led the effort died in 2016. “The fact that Jesse Jackson brings recognition to Greenville and to South Carolina, you would think that they would take advantage of that legacy to use it for tourism,” said Abel A. Bartley, a professor of African American and civil rights history at Clemson University. “The things he did to move our country and our nation forward on civil rights deserves some kind of recognition. And his hometown in particular should lead the way.” Some in Greenville were more interested on Tuesday in reminiscing about quieter, more intimate memories. They remembered Mr. Jackson’s trips back home when he was already an established political figure, how he would ask to go to S & S Cafeteria on Pleasantburg Drive to order his favorite banana cream pie. And they recalled the rhyme and riddle game he would play with his mother, Helen Burns, even in the months before her death in 2015. He would stand by her bedside at the hospital, say a random phrase like “big son went down to the river,” and she would respond with a sentence that rhymed and matched thematically. Freddie Jean Clinkscales, 84, who went to high school with Mr. Jackson, looked up at the house on Haynie Street on Tuesday. She thought of the young man who “was always trying to help everybody,” she said, and who decades later fought to make sure she could sit wherever she wanted to. It had felt so belittling in her youth to step onto an empty bus and be forced to hold herself steady with a pole in the back. If it had not been for people like Mr. Jackson, she said, “we’d still be hanging onto that pole.” Eduardo Medina is a Times reporter covering the South.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Over the past year, the Trump administration has engaged in unconventional diplomacy, gunboat diplomacy and, in the most sensitive crises, diplomacy without diplomats. On Tuesday, the administration tried all three tactics at once. In Geneva, President Trump’s most trusted envoys — his real estate friend Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner — engaged the Iranians in the morning, then the Russians and the Ukrainians in the afternoon. It was a stark example of Mr. Trump’s conviction that the State Department and the National Security Council, the two institutions that have coordinated negotiations over global crises for nearly 80 years, are best left on the sidelines. And so, the Witkoff-Kushner duo has been at the center of recent efforts to end a nuclear crisis in Iran that has stretched over two decades, and a war in Ukraine that is days away from entering its fifth year. By all accounts, Mr. Trump has confidence in their approach, reinforced by their negotiations last year to win a cease-fire in Gaza and the return of all Israeli hostages held by Hamas. And countries like Russia, Turkey and the Gulf Arab states have welcomed the arrival of the two men, with their transactional approach born of New York property negotiations, especially given the greater flexibility offered by Mr. Witkoff and Mr. Kushner. They talk the language of deal makers, and do not spend much time lecturing on human rights or democracy building. And not infrequently, their interlocutors on diplomatic issues are closely linked to the business deals that the Trump and Witkoff families are negotiating. “Some countries really welcome this informal structure at the Trump White House,” said Asli Aydintasbas, a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. But, she added, “I have not seen anyone hugely impressed with the diplomatic skills of the current team.” One person close to the Kremlin said that Russian officials appreciated Mr. Witkoff’s warmth and enthusiasm for the negotiations, even as they sometimes doubted his reliability as a messenger. But he was clearly new to the issues dividing Washington and Moscow, and at first brought no other American experts into his negotiations. More recently, the Russians have been happy to have Mr. Kushner’s involvement, the person said, because of his more organized and structured approach. Some Russians have taken to calling the duo “Witkoff and Zyatkoff,” because “zyat” is Russian for son-in-law. The Iranians also have a nickname for Mr. Kushner, using the Persian word for son-in-law: Damad Trump, again defining Mr. Kushner’s influence by virtue of his marriage to the president’s daughter, Ivanka. Iranian media have dedicated coverage and columns to Mr. Kushner’s participation. Ahmad Zeidabadi, a prominent political analyst and columnist, wrote in Asr Iran newspaper that Mr. Kushner’s participation in talks was something “positive.” “He represents the pragmatic and softer side of Trump,” he said. Mr. Kushner, in an interview last October , said that his and Mr. Witkoff’s approach to diplomacy relied on being “deal guys” who “have to understand people.” Mr. Witkoff was known in real estate circles for major transactions, including buying the Woolworth Building, once New York’s tallest skyscraper, in 1998. Mr. Kushner followed his father, the real estate developer Charles Kushner, into the business and later expanded into private equity. Mr. Kushner holds no official government title, and gets no government salary, while Mr. Witkoff is a U.S. “special envoy.” In Mr. Trump’s first term, Mr. Kushner spearheaded the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab countries — though his hopes of bringing Saudi Arabia aboard have not yet come to fruition. Last year, his efforts negotiating the cease-fire in Gaza drew praise even from some Democrats, for pushing closer to ending a war that President Joseph R. Biden Jr. could not. Supporters of the administration see Mr. Witkoff and Mr. Kushner as ideal negotiators in part because their personal wealth, they say, makes them more resistant to corrupting influences. But both men face questions over apparent conflicts of interest. Mr. Witkoff’s son Zach is the chief executive of World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s cryptocurrency company. An investment firm tied to the United Arab Emirates purchased nearly half the company last year for $500 million. Mr. Kushner raised several billion dollars before Mr. Trump’s second term from overseas investors, including government wealth funds in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, countries he had worked with when he served as a senior White House adviser during Mr. Trump’s first term. Yet as they engage with Mr. Witkoff and Mr. Kushner, the Russians and the Iranians share a strategy: delay. At the Munich Security Conference last weekend, several participants on the edges of the negotiations over Ukraine, which Russia invaded four years ago next Tuesday, said repeatedly that Russia had every reason to engage in the negotiations and little compelling reason to sign an agreement. President Vladimir V. Putin believes he is winning, military and intelligence officials from several Western countries said in recent days. And he is convinced that even if it takes 18 months to two years to complete his hold on the Donbas region, each day of fighting and each night of Russian missiles and drones raining down on energy infrastructure and apartment buildings secure him more leverage. For the Iranians, delay is the regime’s last strategy for survival. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was in Slovakia and Hungary early this week but is not participating in either of the Geneva negotiations, made the case for pessimism. “It’s going to be hard,” he told reporters. “It’s been very difficult for anyone to do real deals with Iran, because we’re dealing with radical Shia clerics who are making theological decisions, not geopolitical ones.” But the commonalities end there. In the Iranian case, Mr. Trump is backing up his diplomacy with a threat of fairly imminent military action if there is no progress — maybe in days, perhaps in weeks. In the Russia-Ukraine case, he has slowed down the military pressure, halting the direct provision of arms to Ukraine that took place — with strong congressional support — in the Biden years. The president has also cracked down on the Russian “shadow fleet” selling oil, exacerbating Mr. Putin’s deepening economic troubles, even while the Trump administration floats ideas about U.S. investment in Russia if a deal, almost any deal, can be announced. Given those dynamics, some analysts predicted that Mr. Putin could still make a deal to stop the fighting in Ukraine, especially if he secured a far-reaching rapprochement with the United States and a withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from the rest of the Donbas. The negotiations with Iran are overshadowed by the size of the U.S. naval force — a “great armada” in Mr. Trump’s telling — that is being assembled in the Red Sea, clearly positioned to strike if the president so decides. But the Iranians are hardly de-escalating. They have temporarily closed the Strait of Hormuz because of Iranian live fire exercises, a not-so-gentle reminder of the country’s ability to throw energy markets into chaos. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, did not contribute much to the spirit of finding a nonmilitary solution when he was asked about the presence of one U.S. carrier group and the arrival in a week or so of a second — a huge massing of firepower. “An aircraft carrier is a dangerous machine, but even more dangerous than that is the weapon capable of sending it to the bottom of the sea,” he said as he commemorated the 1978 uprising that toppled the pro-American Shah of Iran. (The Shah’s son, Reza Pahlavi, was in Munich over the weekend, at one of many large protests around the world that echoed his calls for th",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The U.S. Capitol Police arrested an 18-year-old man on Tuesday afternoon after he exited a vehicle and ran toward the Capitol building with a loaded shotgun. No one was hurt and there was no further threat to the area, the agency said. The episode occurred just after noon, when the armed man got out of a white Mercedes S.U.V. parked on Maryland Avenue and began running toward the Capitol, Chief Michael G. Sullivan of the Capitol Police told reporters. Capitol Police officers confronted the man at the base of a staircase walkway near the West Front of the building, drew their firearms and ordered him to drop his weapon. The man “immediately complied” and lay on the ground, where he was taken into custody, Mr. Sullivan said. The man was wearing a tactical vest and gloves and carrying additional ammunition rounds. A Kevlar helmet and a gas mask were also found in his vehicle, Mr. Sullivan said. Investigators were still working to determine the man’s motive. Capitol Police temporarily closed a section of Maryland Avenue near the Garfield Monument, and the authorities have footage of the man but were asking members of the public who may have taken additional cellphone footage to send it in, Mr. Sullivan said. Capitol Police identified the man as Carter Camacho of Smyrna, Ga., and said in a statement that he was arrested for unlawful activities, carrying a rifle without a license, having an unregistered firearm and having unregistered ammunition. He was not previously known to Capitol Police, and there did not appear to be any other suspects involved, the agency said. Congress was not in session this week, but the episode comes at a time when lawmakers have faced escalating threats. A man attacked Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota during a town hall event in Minneapolis less than a month ago, and lawmakers had already been grappling with intense fears about their personal safety after the assassination of the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk on a college campus. Capitol Police said it had investigated nearly 15,000 “concerning statements, behaviors, and communications directed against members of Congress, their families, staff, and the Capitol complex” in 2025, roughly a 58 percent increase over 2024 . Mr. Sullivan, who commended the officers who responded on Tuesday for their “brave service,” said that Capitol Police had held an active shooter exercise a few months ago “virtually in the same spot” where the man was confronted. “We do those active shooter exercises every single month,” he said, “and that’s why we do it.” Anushka Patil is a Times reporter covering breaking and developing news around the world.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The United States indicted the captain of an oil tanker that led American forces on a weekslong chase across the Atlantic Ocean after being stopped on its way to Venezuela, the first time President Trump’s crackdown on Venezuelan oil has resulted in criminal charges. The captain, Avtandil Kalandadze, was charged with two federal crimes, according to the Feb. 12 indictment, which has not previously been reported. The first count accused Mr. Kalandadze of falsely flying the flag of Guyana on the tanker — the ship was not registered in that country — in an attempt to evade being seized by the U.S. Coast Guard on Dec. 20. The second accuses Mr. Kalandadze of failing to obey an order from the Coast Guard to stop the tanker and allow U.S. forces to board it. Instead, the ship, then known as Bella 1, which had been sailing in the Caribbean Sea toward Venezuela, turned back into the Atlantic, chased by U.S. forces. Along the way, the ship changed its name to Marinera and claimed Russian protection. Its crew painted a Russian flag on the tanker’s side, and it was registered in Russia’s official ship database . The Russian government used diplomatic channels to request that the United States stop chasing the tanker. But U.S. forces boarded and seized the ship on Jan. 7, near the United Kingdom, detaining Mr. Kalandadze and the rest of the crew. The seizure of the ship was part of Mr. Trump’s attempt to take control of Venezuela’s multi-billion-dollar oil industry. So far, the United States has boarded eight other vessels involved in the Venezuelan oil trade. The ships are part of a so-called ghost fleet transporting oil from Venezuela, Iran or Russia around the globe in violation of sanctions placed by the United States and other countries. U.S. authorities had obtained a seizure warrant for the Bella 1 based on its history of transporting Iranian oil for groups linked to terrorism. After the ship was seized, Mr. Kalandadze’s wife, Natia Dzadzama, initiated an unsuccessful legal challenge in the United Kingdom, seeking a judicial review of her husband’s detention, according to local media reports. Aamer Anwar, a lawyer for Ms. Dzadzama, said in a statement on Tuesday that “the U.S. has once again shown a total disregard for the rule of law and international obligations with its closest ally, the U.K.” The White House and the Justice Department did not immediately reply to requests for comment. The BBC reported last month that the United States planned to charge another member of the crew but had released the remaining 26 crew members. Note: The International Maritime Organization issues an IMO number, a permanent identification number, that remains associated with a vessel throughout its lifetime unlike a ship’s name, which can change frequently. The ship in this article is 9230880, known as Marinera, or previously as Bella 1.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Revelations about ties to Jeffrey Epstein have toppled leaders of corporate America, Hollywood and academia as the Justice Department has released millions of documents and images from the disgraced financier’s files in recent months. But the Trump administration has steadfastly repelled such fallout, dismissing any associations that top officials had with the sex offender as trivial. The White House’s fortress mentality was mobilized last week after Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, acknowledged that he had traveled to Mr. Epstein’s private island and had another encounter with him years after Mr. Lutnick claimed to have cut ties with him. Such associations have led to the resignations of business leaders, but President Trump’s White House was unfazed. The stark contrast underscores the murky nature of who is deemed to be complicit and who is not when it comes to Mr. Epstein, and the Trump administration’s ability to repel even the most harsh public scrutiny. Despite bipartisan calls for Mr. Lutnick’s resignation, the White House dismissed concerns about his character and credibility. “Secretary Lutnick remains a very important member of President Trump’s team, and the president fully supports the secretary,” Karoline Leavitt, White House press secretary, said last week. Mr. Lutnick’s comments during Senate testimony contradicted his assertion on a podcast last year that he had been so disgusted by Mr. Epstein during a 2005 visit to his townhouse that Mr. Lutnick never set foot in a room with Mr. Epstein again. Mr. Lutnick’s name appeared in more than 250 documents in the Epstein files released by the Justice Department, a review by The New York Times found. He said that he first met Mr. Epstein when they became neighbors in Manhattan in 2005, but that they met only twice more over the next 14 years that he could recall. However, at the Senate hearing Mr. Lutnick confirmed that he and his family traveled to the island in 2012 for a lunch with Mr. Epstein during a vacation aboard his yacht with his wife, children, nannies and another family. The visit took place four years after Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida to soliciting prostitution from a minor as part of a deal with federal prosecutors. Mr. Lutnick is not the only prominent Trump administration official who has appeared in the Epstein documents. The records showed that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, once went hunting for dinosaur fossils with Mr. Epstein. An email in the files showed that Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, invited Mr. Epstein to a 2016 Valentine’s Day party. The Trump administration’s muted response is a striking departure from that of corporate America. Thomas J. Pritzker, a billionaire heir to the Hyatt Hotels fortune , stepped down from his role Monday as executive chairman of the Hyatt Hotels Corporation. Last week, Casey Wasserman, a Los Angeles entertainment executive and chair of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics whose name recently surfaced in the Epstein files, said he had started the process of selling the talent agency he founded more than two decades ago. And last year, Harvard started a new review of ties that its former president Lawrence H. Summers and others at the institution had with Mr. Epstein. After the release of emails between Mr. Summers and Mr. Epstein in November, Mr. Summers said he would step back from public commitments . “Corporate America, they answer to a board,” said Gene Grabowski, a Washington-based crisis communications expert. “Trump doesn’t answer to a board.” Mr. Grabowski added: “The closest thing he has is the voters, and he either doesn’t want to believe the polls or thinks he can reverse them.” A poll conducted last month by The New York Times and Siena University showed that Mr. Trump’s lowest approval rating within the Republican Party came on his handling of the release of files related to Mr. Epstein: Only 53 percent of Republicans approved of his handling of that matter. Mr. Lutnick’s ties to Mr. Epstein pale when compared with those of Mr. Trump, who socialized regularly with Mr. Epstein in the 1990s and 2000s . Using a proprietary search tool, The Times identified more than 5,300 files containing more than 38,000 references to Mr. Trump, his wife, his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, and other related words and phrases in the latest batch of emails, government files, videos and other records released by the Justice Department. Mr. Trump has downplayed his association with Mr. Epstein and accused Democrats of concocting conspiracy theories about their friendship. The president said last summer that he had ended his relationship with the financier because Mr. Epstein had “hired away” spa attendants at Mar-a-Lago. In defending Mr. Lutnick, the White House is again pushing the boundaries of its ability to weather a controversy that might have hobbled other administrations. “This administration has placed all its chips on the idea that the public will eventually tire of controversy, and now they’re betting that even allegations tied to pedophilia fall into that same bucket,” said Alexandra LaManna, who served as a spokeswoman in the Biden administration. “That’s a category of accusation that, historically, has been politically and morally radioactive.” Noting that Mr. Lutnick vacationed on Mr. Epstein’s island, she added: “It’s hard to imagine any president other than Trump trying to shrug that off.” Alan Rappeport is an economic policy reporter for The Times, based in Washington.

      "content": "Pinned Claire Moses Here’s more on his life. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, America’s most influential Black figure in the years between the civil rights crusades of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the election of Barack Obama, died on Tuesday . He was 84. In a statement, his family said that Mr. Jackson “died peacefully,” but did not give a cause. Mr. Jackson, who was celebrated for his impassioned oratory and populist vision of a “rainbow coalition” of the poor and forgotten, picked up the mantle of Dr. King after his assassination in 1968. He ran for president twice , but he never achieved either the commanding moral stature of Dr. King or the ultimate political triumph attained by Mr. Obama. Tributes flowed in for Mr. Jackson , including from President Trump, who called him “a good man” and a “force of nature,” and former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who described him as “a man of God and of the people.” The Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader, described Mr. Jackson as his mentor. “He was a consequential and transformative leader who changed this nation and the world,” Mr. Sharpton said in a statement.

Credit... Kamil Krzaczynski/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images By the early afternoon on Tuesday, mourners had left around half a dozen bouquets of flowers and a few balloons outside of the Rev. Jesse Jackson’s Tudor-style house on Constance Avenue in the South Shore neighborhood. Next door, Junelle Speller said she had bought her home because she fell in love with the house, but living beside Mr. Jackson was a wonderful bonus. “It was always surreal for us to be living next door to a civil rights icon, someone my husband and I both studied in school here in Chicago,” Mrs. Speller said. Despite Mr. Jackson’s larger-than-life persona and soaring oratory skills, Mrs. Speller soon discovered that in person the civil rights leader “was very grounded, very down to earth, approachable, personable and vibrant.” “He had a deliberate but very inspirational way of speaking,” she said. “You’d be kind of awestruck. But he was at your level, meeting you and sharing those stories, providing motivation for this period of time, for the African American community.” Anita O’Neal, 67, stopped by the Jackson home and showed reporters gathered outside the house a wrinkled photo of herself from 1968. She was 11 years old in the picture, wearing a prim, white outfit for a flight from Chicago to Cape Girardeau, Mo. Sitting in a seat and looking up at her is a young Mr. Jackson, who at the time was a protégé of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Ms. O’Neal said she had come to appreciate the experience only later on in life. “I read about who he was and understood who he was. It was quite an honor for me,” she said. Image Anita O’Neal shows a photo of herself with Jesse Jackson when she was 11 years old. Credit... Nam Y. Huh/Associated Press Ms. O’Neal recalled Mr. Jackson’s quieter side. When he would attend services at St. Sabina Church in the Auburn Gresham neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side, he wouldn’t draw attention to himself, she said. “He wouldn’t come with fanfare,” she said. “He would just walk in, walk down the center aisle, and just go on and sit down.” The pastor, Michael L. Pfleger, would introduce him, she recalled, but Mr. Jackson “didn’t want any recognition. He was there for service.” Joy Jones, 66, said she had come straight to Mr. Jackson’s house after working an overnight shift at a hospital in the Bronzeville neighborhood on the city’s South Side. Still dressed in her purple scrubs, Ms. Jones said she hoped someone would follow in Mr. Jackson’s footsteps just as Mr. Jackson picked up Mr. King’s fight for civil rights after his assassination. “I’m praying that someone will stand up and will continue the movement forward,” Ms. Jones said. “Because it seems this administration is trying to make us take some steps backward, but I really hope that someone — male, female, someone — will stand up and say, ‘We’ve got to keep moving. We’ve got to keep going.’” Among the other Chicagoans who dropped by to pay their respects was Delores Brown, who set down a bouquet of flowers next to the small shrine that had been growing on the Jackson family’s front lawn. He had been a role model, she said, for people in the South Side community where she lived, especially for young Black men. “He’s also been a person that has spoken for us on so many levels when we were not able to speak for ourselves,” she said.

Vest for The New York Times The museum at the Lorraine Motel was closed, typical for a Tuesday. Yet on a cloudy Memphis day, with a cold wind whipping the flags lowered to half-staff, there were still a few people who came to pay their respects outside. On this day, it was not just about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whose assassination on a balcony at the motel on April 4, 1968, defined the city in American history. For at least a couple of visitors, it was a chance to mourn the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who died at 84 on Tuesday and was among the people who witnessed the murder and sought to carry on Dr. King’s civil rights legacy. “I had to be there,” said Theresa Jackson, 56, who had pulled over Tuesday morning, on her way back to Illinois from Biloxi, Miss. Visiting the motel, which is now home to the National Civil Rights Museum , “gave me chills, just the presence of being there.” Across the South, leaders mourned the death of Mr. Jackson, who was born in South Carolina and crisscrossed the region campaigning for civil rights, championing voter registration and making two unsuccessful bids for the presidency. But in Memphis, where Mr. Jackson returned again and again to the site of Dr. King’s assassination, there was a unique grief over the loss of an elder who had inspired the city’s next generation of Black leaders. “He was a fixture,” Mayor Paul Young said in an interview on Tuesday, recounting how as a young student, he voted for Mr. Jackson in a mock presidential election because “he was somebody I could see myself in, that looked like me.” He met Mr. Jackson at the 2024 Democratic National Convention, Mr. Young recalled, and they had a conversation that was both “personal and meaningful.” “I get to serve as mayor today,” Mr. Young said, “tied to the ground that he broke.” Mr. Jackson embodied the connection between Chicago, where he lived, and Memphis, a familiar stop for many Black Americans traveling north. “He almost was sort of like a son of Memphis in many ways,” said State Representative Justin Pearson, who represents Memphis in the Tennessee General Assembly and received a phone call from Mr. Jackson in 2023 after Mr. Pearson’s colleagues had expelled him from the chamber over a gun control protest. “His connection to our city is obviously deeply rooted in sort of the grief of that loss of Dr. King, but also in this desire and willingness to see our city thrive, to become a better place,” Mr. Pearson added. Mr. Jackson built a partnership with Stax Records , a prominent Memphis institution , spreading his message as a signed, spoken-word recording artist. He spoke at churches and schools, stopped at the occasional barbecue j",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Representative Randy Fine, Republican of Florida, on Tuesday faced a barrage of calls for his resignation from Democrats — and silence from Republican leaders — after making an Islamophobic statement suggesting he prefers dogs to Muslims. Mr. Fine, a Jewish first-term congressman who was known in the Florida Legislature as “The Hebrew Hammer” and often makes Islamophobic remarks on social media, made the statement in question on Sunday in response to a post from a Palestinian activist based in New York City. Nerdeen Kiswani, a Palestinian Muslim New Yorker and organizer, said in a social media post that dung-filled snowdrifts in the city proved that dogs should not have a place in society as indoor pets because, she wrote, “like we’ve said all along, they are unclean.” Mr. Fine responded: “If they force us to choose, the choice between dogs and Muslims is not a difficult one.” The comment prompted immediate and unequivocal condemnation from Democrats. Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said that Mr. Fine “is a disgrace to the United States Congress. He is an Islamophobic, disgusting and unrepentant bigot.” Mr. Jeffries added that it was “unacceptable that Mike Johnson and House Republicans continue to remain silent,” referring to the speaker. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, the reigning Democratic king of trolling Republicans online, wrote bluntly, “Resign now, you racist slob.” Many House Democrats called for Mr. Fine to be stripped of his committee assignments. But Mr. Johnson remained silent, and Mr. Fine doubled down in response to the backlash. “My post was in response to a major Muslim leader saying dogs should be forbidden from New York City because to some Muslims, it bothers them,” Mr. Fine said in an appearance on Newsmax. “If they’re going to make us choose between our dogs and them going home, the choice is easy.” One of the few conservatives who criticized Mr. Fine publicly was Megyn Kelly, the podcast host, who wrote in an online post that “instead of attacking the person or the policy, you went full bigot.” On social media, Ms. Kiswani called Mr. Fine a “rabid Zionist” who used her words “as an excuse to post genocidal rhetoric against Muslims.” In a follow-up email to The New York Times, Ms. Kiswani said that she had intended her words to land as a “mild, satirical” post, and viewed Mr. Fine’s response as reflective of a political climate in which “anti-Palestinian and anti-Muslim bigotry is normalized and hostility toward our communities is more easily justified.” She said her post was misinterpreted and used as “grounds for days of attacks, threats and widespread misinformation, including inaccurate claims that I am part of Mayor Mamdani’s administration.” Mr. Fine has referred to both Muslim women in Congress as “terrorists.” In a post in May, he addressed Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, who had accused the Israeli government of starving Gazans, saying she should “tell your fellow Muslim terrorists to release the hostages and surrender. Until then, #StarveAway.” In July, Mr. Fine called Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, a “terrorist” after she appeared to refer to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel as a war criminal. “I’m sure it is difficult to see us welcome the killer of so many of your fellow Muslim terrorists,” he wrote online, referring to Ms. Omar. “The only shame is that you serve in Congress.” At the time, House Democratic leaders condemned his comment. Mr. Johnson never did. Annie Karni is a congressional correspondent for The Times.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The White House on Tuesday rejected the latest offer from Democratic lawmakers on proposed new constraints on federal immigration officers, the latest sign that there would not be a quick resolution of the stalemate that has left the Department of Homeland Security without funding since Saturday. A White House official who provided a statement on the condition of anonymity to describe private negotiations said the two parties were still far apart, adding that President Trump’s team remained interested in continuing good-faith talks to resolve the impasse. In response, aides for the Democratic leaders in Congress said that Republicans had largely ignored the guardrails the public was demanding, and urged them to start negotiating in good faith as they said their side had been doing. Both White House officials and Democrats on Capitol Hill have kept largely confidential the specifics of their offers to end the standoff that allowed funding for the agency to lapse as of 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The outlines of the Democratic demands, however, are well known: limits on masked police, an end to random sweeps, new requirements for judicial warrants, putting “sensitive locations” such as churches, schools, hospitals and polling places off limits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement among them. The offer was given to the White House Monday evening but brushed aside by the White House less than 24 hours later. “These are common sense,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said Sunday on CNN about the Democratic proposals. “Police departments across America use them. We have a rogue agency. Why don’t we rein them in? That’s what the American people are asking Republicans.” Democrats have portrayed the earlier White House counteroffer to Democrats, which has not been made public, as “nonserious.” People familiar with the talks have said that the White House has not been responsive to many of the Democratic demands for limits on federal immigration agents, and has pushed for new authority of its own, including increased penalties for those who dox officers. Some Republicans have also said that they want an end to local and state policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, sometimes called sanctuary city policies, in exchange for concessions. “When it comes to masks, I don’t know of another law enforcement agency in the country that has an 8,000-percent increase in threats,” Tom Homan, President Trump’s border czar, said Sunday on CBS News’s “Face the Nation.” “Just yesterday, the director of ICE, his wife was filmed walking to work. His home address has been doxed. His kids have been doxed and filmed.” With Congress on a weeklong recess and lawmakers scattered around the world and the nation, chances for approval of a funding agreement this week remained remote since members would have to return to Washington to pass it and the negotiations were not showing any movement. Democrats made clear they intended to stick to their demands and did not appear to be uneasy about any political backlash for blocking money for the agency that also funds airport security, the Coast Guard and disaster relief. “We need change that is dramatic, that is bold, that is meaningful and that is transformational,” Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the House minority leader, said on CBS. “For instance, judicial warrants should be required before ICE agents can storm private property or rip everyday Americans out of their homes.” Many of the Department of Homeland Security’s workers remain on the job but run the risk of missing a paycheck if the funding fight drags on. Mr. Trump is scheduled to deliver the first formal State of the Union address of his second term before Congress next Tuesday. Without some breakthrough, he will make the speech before Congress with one agency without a congressional appropriation for the year, though ICE has a separate pot of money from an earlier measure that can keep it operating.
