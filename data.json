      "content": "1 Brilliant Vanguard Index Fund to Buy Before It Soars 25%, According to Wall Street Analysts David Dierking, The Motley Fool Fri, February 20, 2026 at 9:20 AM PST 3 min read NVDA INTC For the first time in more than three years, investors are giving an extended look to areas of the market beyond tech. Energy and consumer staples are among the best-performing sectors this year. Value and dividend stocks have made a comeback. International equities have been on a tear since the beginning of 2025. Another category that's had a strong start to the year is small caps. Long unloved and ignored, they're getting attention for their comparatively small exposure to tech and attractive valuations. The Russell 2000, a generally accepted benchmark for small caps, is receiving some eye-catching price targets from analysts. Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » The ETF Action database, which compiles price targets for companies within a particular ETF, currently has a 25% 12-month upside target for the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF (NASDAQ: VTWO) . Let's break down the investment case for this fund heading into the remainder of 2026. Image source: Getty Images. Why Wall Street is turning bullish on small caps again Even though small caps are considered riskier and have more boom/bust potential than large caps , there comes a point where the value and the narrative are impossible to ignore. For example: Valuation concerns about megacaps, potential rate cuts, and a deregulation tailwind would all benefit small caps. Currently, the Russell 2000 is expected  to grow 2026 earnings by 19% compared to a 13% growth forecast for the S&P 500 . The Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF has a price/earnings (P/E) ratio of 18 versus 28 for the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF . It's not often that the value and growth stories both line up for small caps, but that's happening now. And the market has begun to recognize it. Why the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF is positioned for the next leg Megacaps have dominated the U.S. equity market for years, but concentration risk is beginning to rise. The same \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that have pulled the major market averages higher are all down year-to-date as of Feb. 13, and they're all down more than 10% from their all-time highs. Tech has become an anchor this year. Small companies tend to disproportionately benefit from lower interest rates because many carry higher debt loads. Current rate-cut expectations are modest, but any unexpected disinflation, growth, or labor market shock could quickly have the Federal Reserve thinking about more rate cuts. Story Continues But if the U.S. economy can maintain a \"soft landing\" or \"no landing\" outcome, small caps could find additional momentum. For years, investors were interested only in the growth stories being offered by large-cap and megacap stocks. The next phase of the market cycle could finally reward the small caps.

Q4 revenue climbed 12% year-over-year to $1.1 billion, driven by a 17% surge in order entries across the banking and retail sectors. The company’s strategic focus on modular retail solutions and ATM recycling technology has led to significant market gains, including nine new major retail logos in the US grocery and pharmacy sectors. While operating expenses rose by 3.7% due to labor costs and investments in service infrastructure, management noted that the rollout of new field service software is largely complete, positioning the company for margin expansion starting in Q2 2026. Despite a slight decline in retail margins caused by external cyber-related disruptions, the banking segment remains robust with strong branch automation demand in North America and a recovery expected in Latin America. Diebold Nixdorf enters 2026 with a solid $730 million product backlog and anticipates revenue growth to be weighted toward H2 of the year. The CEO emphasized that the company remains disciplined in its capital allocation, prioritizing shareholder returns through buybacks while evaluating tuck-in acquisitions that could immediately bolster its service capabilities and global footprint.

(NASDAQ: RELY ) is one of the best new tech stocks to invest in now . On February 18, Remitly Global recorded revenue of $1.635 billion in the full year 2025, which was a 29% increase year-over-year. Q4 was particularly strong with $442 million in revenue and $41 million in net income, driven by a 19% increase in active users to over 9 million. A significant highlight was the surge in high-value transactions, with volume from very high amount senders skyrocketing 105% in the quarter. The company is undergoing a major leadership transition as co-founder Matt Oppenheimer steps into the role of Executive Chairman, passing the CEO mantle to former Amazon and Apple executive Sebastian Gunningham. This shift comes as Remitly scales its product ecosystem through new offerings like Flex, which is a send-now-pay-later service that has already surpassed 120,000 users. Furthermore, the launch of Remitly Business and the integration of advanced AI fraud models have improved operational efficiency, leading to record-low transaction losses and a tripled free cash flow of $283 million for the year.

On February 4, Ralliant reported Q4 2025 revenue of $555 million, which was only a 1% increase year-over-year but exceeded company guidance. Growth was uneven across segments: while the Communications division surged by 29% and Sensors & Safety Systems grew 6%, the Test & Measurement segment saw a 6% decline as customers remained cautious with capital expenditure. The company faced a significant financial setback during the quarter, recording a $1.4 billion non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to its EA Elektro-Automatik business. Management attributed this write-down to a cooling in EV demand and shifts in global subsidies. Additionally, Ralliant is navigating structural cost headwinds following its recent spin-off, which are expected to impact adjusted EBITDA margins by 250 basis points in 2026. Ralliant issued full-year revenue guidance of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.22 to $2.42 for 2026. While the Test & Measurement segment is expected to remain at the lower end of growth expectations, the company remains committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy that balances organic investment in AI and digital platforms with strategic tuck-in acquisitions.

DATE Friday, Feb. 20, 2026 at 11 a.m. ET CALL PARTICIPANTS President and Chief Executive Officer — Katherine Holt Antonello Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer — Michael Aldo Pedraja Full Conference Call Transcript Katherine Holt Antonello: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2025 earnings call. Joining me is Michael Aldo Pedraja, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, I will begin by providing highlights of our fourth quarter 2025 results and then hand it over to Michael for more details on our financials. Before our Q&A, I will come back to you with some additional thoughts. I would like to begin with how we are actively addressing the elevated frequency of California cumulative trauma claims. To be clear, this remains a California-specific issue. Claim frequency in our other states and within non-CT claims in California continues to trend favorably. We recognized early that the CT environment was creating a hard market in California, and we moved decisively, have implemented rate increases, and tightened underwriting on several classes of business. We are not waiting for legislative reform, though we do believe the growing impact on California businesses and public budgets will make the case for reform increasingly difficult to ignore. While we are confident that these California pricing and underwriting actions, along with the steps we are taking across the country, will strengthen our underwriting profitability, they are also likely to reduce written premium in 2026. It is worth highlighting that our small commercial franchise maintained strong retention rates throughout 2025, a clear sign the investments we have made in automation and ease of use are genuinely resonating. I am also pleased to report that our standard fourth quarter full actuarial assessment concluded that no additional reserve strengthening or adjustments to our current accident year loss and LAE ratio was necessary. In addition to our internal analysis, we engaged a market-leading actuarial firm to independently assess our estimated ultimate loss, and they concluded that our carried reserves were well within the range of reasonable estimates. We believe the outcome of these two analyses confirms the actions we took in the third quarter adequately addressed recent workers’ compensation trends. I am excited to discuss our new workers’ compensation product, which represents a strategic expansion of our capabilities. By leveraging our core workers’ compensation expertise into the excess layer, we are creating new growth avenues while diversifying our risk profile. Our aggressive adoption of AI tools has accelerated the product’s development, and I am pleased to report that we are now accepting submissions. The early market response has been strong, and we expect this product will deepen our distribution partner relationships while expanding our addressable market. Story Continues We continued to execute on our commitment to returning capital to stockholders by delivering $215,000,000 of share repurchases and regular quarterly dividends in 2025. In January, we completed the $125,000,000 capital recapitalization plan that we announced in the third quarter. These capital management steps reflect our continued confidence in our financial position and our commitment to delivering value to shareholders. Along with our operational performance, these actions increased our book value per share, including the gain, by 11% to $51.31. We believe our focus on disciplined underwriting, prudent risk management, and strategic investments continues to position us strongly in the workers’ compensation insurance market, which is evidenced by A.M. Best’s recent reaffirmation of our insurance companies’ financial strength rating of A. With that, Michael will now provide a deeper dive into our fourth quarter financial results, and then I will return to provide my closing remarks. Michael? Michael Aldo Pedraja: Thank you, Katherine. Gross premiums written were $156,800,000 compared to $176,300,000 for the prior-year quarter, a decrease of 11% due primarily to a decrease in new business writings and lower final audit premiums, partially offset by higher renewal business premium. Our losses and LAE were $134,400,000 versus $113,200,000 a year ago, an increase of 18.7% due primarily to an increase in the accident year 2025 selected loss and LAE ratio and the absence of favorable developments in the fourth quarter of this year. Commission expense was $25,800,000 for the quarter versus $24,400,000 for the prior year, an increase of 5.7% driven by nonrecurring adjustments. Underwriting expenses were $39,800,000 for the quarter versus $44,200,000 for the prior year, a decrease of 10%. The improvement in underwriting expenses for the fourth quarter was due primarily to continued expense management efforts, including reduced personnel costs and other variable costs, such as policyholder dividends and bad debt. Net investment income was $31,400,000 for the quarter compared to $26,700,000 for the prior year, an increase of 17.6%, due mostly to private equity investment return distributions and an overall higher book yield on our fixed income portfolio. As Katherine mentioned, we executed an investment rebalancing to address several strategic goals, including reducing our equity investment allocation to target levels and increasing our overall portfolio yield. Our equity investments, like most in the market, have appreciated very nicely and reached 16% of our investment portfolio versus a target allocation of approximately 10%. As part of the investment rebalancing, we also sold low-yielding fixed income securities to offset the associated equity gains and redeploy the proceeds into higher-yielding fixed income investments. The investment rebalancing accomplished several goals, including reducing our equity investments to target allocation, increasing our overall investment portfolio yield by a net 40 basis points, extracting an estimated net present value gain of $16,000,000, and reducing our required capital. The sale of fixed income investments produced an after-tax realized loss of $40,000,000, which reduced net income and adjusted book value per share during the quarter. Our stockholders’ equity and book value per share were not impacted by the investment rebalancing. Our fixed maturities maintain a modified duration of 4.4 with strong average credit quality of A+. Aided by our investment rebalancing, our weighted average book yield increased to 4.9% at quarter end compared to 4.5% for the prior year. Our adjusted net income, which excludes net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses and the benefit of our LPT deferred gain amortization, was $14,500,000 for the quarter, compared to $28,700,000 last year. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased almost 2,400,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $40.94 per share, or $97,000,000. The average repurchase price represented a 20% discount to our book value per share, including the deferred gain, and adjusted book value per share. During the period from January 1 through February 18 of this year, the company repurchased a further 898,594 shares of its common stock at an average price of $44.28 per share. Our remaining share repurchase authorization is $53,100,000. As we have highlighted, we aim to be good stewards of our shareholders’ capital. At current price levels, we are convinced that the Employers Holdings, Inc. stock is meaningfully undervalued, and executing share repurchases at these price levels produces a significant return on investment and generates significant value for our continuing shareholders. I will now turn the call back to Katherine. Katherine Holt Antonello: Thank you, Michael. Yesterday, our Boa",

(NYSE: FIG ) is one of the best new tech stocks to invest in now . On February 18, Figma reported the financial results for Q4 2025, with revenue reaching $304 million, marking a 40% increase year-over-year. For the full year, the company surpassed $1 billion, generating $1.056 billion in total revenue. This growth was supported by a net dollar retention rate of 136% among customers with over $10,000 in ARR and international expansion, which grew 45% compared to the previous year. The company is prioritizing AI-native functionality to drive user engagement and expand its customer base. The CEO highlighted the success of Figma Make and the integration of AI credits, noting that 75% of large customers are already using these credits weekly. However, Figma also anticipates that its non-GAAP operating margin will decrease from 12% in 2025 to 8% in 2026. This is attributed to increased investments in AI infrastructure, elevated stock-based compensation following its IPO, and the costs associated with transitioning to a hybrid monetization model involving both seats and AI credits. Figma provided Q1 2026 revenue guidance of $315 to $317 million and full-year guidance of approximately $1.37 billion.

      "content": "Tax refunds are big this year, IRS data show. Here's how big. Medora Lee, USA TODAY Fri, February 20, 2026 at 9:13 AM PST 4 min read The number of tax returns the IRS has received so far this tax season is down from last year, but refunds are up double digits, IRS data show. The average refund through Feb. 6 was $2,290, up nearly 11% from $2,065 at the same time in 2025 while total returns received fell 5.2%. The IRS noted refund numbers should rise further, too, as refunds claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) are required by law to be held until Feb. 15. These “refund numbers do not include millions of EITC and ACTC refunds to these taxpayers,” the agency said in its release. “This means the refund numbers expected to be released Feb. 27, for refunds processed through Feb. 20, are expected to be higher.” That should be encouraging news to Americans who are struggling under the weight of elevated prices and a slowing job market , analysts said. “Higher refunds should be a tailwind for consumers, particularly lower income consumers who use tax refunds for debt paydown and big-ticket purchases,” said Mihir Bhatia, analyst at Bank of America. Average refunds are big. How to get mine faster? \"Combining direct deposit with electronic filing is the fastest way to receive your refund ,\" the IRS said. Most refunds are issued in less than 21 days for taxpayers who filed a flawless return electronically and chose direct deposit. Nine out of 10 taxpayers already receive their tax refunds by direct deposit, but to boost that closer to 100%, the IRS began phasing out paper checks last September. \"Paper checks are over 16 times more likely to be lost, stolen, altered, or delayed than electronic payments,\" the IRS said. \"Direct deposit also avoids the possibility that a refund check could be returned to the IRS as undeliverable.\" How do I know when my refund’s coming? Through the IRS \" Where's My Refund \" tool, you can track when the IRS received your tax return, when it approved a refund and when it issued the refund. The money should land in your account within five days from the date the IRS approves your refund. If you mailed a paper return and expect a refund, it could take four weeks or more to process your return, the IRS said. Since refunds for Americans who claimed the EITC/ACTC can’t be released until mid-February for early filers , those taxpayers may have to wait until around March 3 to see their refunds in their bank accounts or on debit cards, if they chose direct deposit and there are no issues with the tax return. If you don’t have a bank account, find one through the FDIC website or the National Credit Union Administration using their Credit Union Locator Tool . Usually, people can open a b a nk account pretty quickly. You can also ask your tax preparer if they offer other electronic payment options. Story Continues Otherwise, you might be able to deposit your refund onto a reloadable prepaid debit card or mobile app. Many reloadable prepaid cards and mobile apps have routing and account numbers, which may be different from the card number. Check with your financial institution to make sure your card or app can receive the deposit and double-check the routing and account numbers. Tax filers saw $172.26 billion in federal income tax refunds head their way through March 24. While that's a great deal of money, the total dollar amount is down $16.4 billion or down 8.7% from a year ago. Tax refunds How should people use their tax refunds? Along with that big check comes big responsibility, so make sure not to spend it all away , financial experts said. Here are some ideas : Since refunds are expected to be larger than usual , splitting a refund can be a convenient way to manage your money. You can split the refund in any proportion you want, sending some to an account for immediate use and some for future savings, in up to three different accounts with U.S. financial institutions, reloadable prepaid debit cards, or mobile apps.  You can use your tax software to do it electronically or use IRS Form 8888, Allocation of Refund if you file a paper return. Plan how to use the refund before receiving it. This “reduces overspending risk by assigning the refund a job in advance -- debt payoff, emergency savings, or essential expenses,” said Paul Ricci, chief executive of personal loans site Best Egg. Put debt reduction and financial health ahead of lifestyle upgrades. “Applying refunds toward high-interest balances can reduce financial stress and improve credit utilization,” Ricci said. “Prioritizing emergency savings – 3 to 6 months of expenses -- helps prevent future reliance on credit when unexpected costs arise.” Medora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

(NASDAQ: NXT ) is one of the best new tech stocks to invest in now . On February 17, Nextpower announced a multi-year supply agreement with Jinko Solar (US) Industries Inc. to provide gigawatt-scale steel solar module frames. Under the terms of the deal, Nextpower will supply at least 1 GW of steel frames, with the potential to scale up to 3 GW over three years. These components will support Jinko Solar’s manufacturing operations at its Jacksonville, Florida facility, with production slated to begin in mid-2026. To support this partnership and further localize its supply chain, Nextpower Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT) intends to expand its manufacturing capacity in the Southeastern US to simplify logistics for direct supply to Jinko Solar’s Florida plant. This move follows Nextpower’s recent growth in Memphis and contributes to a network of over 25 US factories that the company has established or expanded since 2021 to meet the rising demand for domestic solar components. The transition to steel frames offers structural and financial advantages for the solar industry. Independent testing indicates that steel frames provide superior durability and stiffness compared to traditional materials for reliability in extreme weather. Furthermore, using US-made steel frames allows developers to add six percent to a tracker project’s domestic content calculation, helping them align with US Treasury Department guidance and national manufacturing priorities.

Heading into its fiscal Q2 2026 report, analysts forecast Copart to earn $0.39 per share on $1.15 billion in sales. In fact, Copart earned just $0.36 per share on sales of $1.12 billion. Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » Image source: Getty Images. Copart Q2 earnings Copart revenues slipped 4% year over year in Q2, resulting in a 10% decline in per-share profit, worsening a decline that began in Q1. Year to date, Copart's sales are down 1%, and earnings are flat against fiscal 2025 at $0.77 per share. That's the bad news. The good news is that Copart's free cash flow is up significantly this year. Although operating cash flow was basically unchanged year over year at $662.8 million, Copart cut its purchases of property and equipment nearly in half, to just $177.7 million. As a result, free cash flow so far this year is a strong $485.1 million -- and trending toward perhaps $970 million through the end of the fiscal year! Is Copart stock a buy? Copart management didn't give much in the way of guidance, but assuming Copart can hit that mark, the stock would be trading for a price-to-free cash flow ratio of 37.4. Back out $5.1 billion in net cash on the balance sheet, and the EV/FCF ratio on this one falls to just 32.1. I can't call the stock a \"buy\" at this valuation -- not with profits flat and revenues falling. But there's no doubt Copart stock is getting cheaper, and it's already a lot cheaper than it was a year ago. Should you buy stock in Copart right now?

      "content": "French Banking Giant Société Générale Launches Euro Stablecoin On XRP Ledger Akriti Seth Thu, February 19, 2026 at 2:33 AM CST 2 min read XRP-USD ETH-USD One of France’s largest banking institutions, Société Générale, is launching a euro-denominated stablecoin, EUR Coinvertible, on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) through its digital asset subsidiary, SG FORGE. It is the first time a major European banking institution has selected XRPL as the primary blockchain for a regulated stablecoin deployment. SG-FORGE, which previously launched the EUR CoinVertible (EURCV) stablecoin on Ethereum in 2023, is now expanding to XRPL. Cassie Craddock, Managing Director, UK & Europe, Ripple said, “Societe Generale-FORGE has long been a pioneer amongst European institutions when it comes to building out a market-leading crypto-assets offering for their customers.” In addition, there is a growing trend of major institutions moving on-chain. Can this be a major validation of XRPL’s enterprise-grade infrastructure? It certainly extends Ripple’s growing partnerships with traditional financial institutions. The move also aligns perfectly with Ripple’s institutional settlement strategy. It focuses on providing the plumbing for banks to move value globally without the friction of the legacy financial system. It signals that high-speed, low-cost networks are becoming essential for modern finance. DISCOVER: Top 20 Crypto to Buy in 2026 Ripple’s Strategy To Position XRPL As “Infrastructure Of Choice For Regulated Financial Institutions Entering Digital Asset Space” Jean-Marc Stenger, CEO of SG-FORGE, emphasized the strategic importance of this expansion. The successful launch of EUR Coinvertible on the XRP Ledger is a new step, reinforcing our commitment to offering next-generation, compliant crypto-assets that promote transparency, security, and scalability. Meanwhile, Ripple executives have called this a “huge win for the ecosystem.” Ripple has been actively courting traditional finance players, particularly in the wake of regulatory clarity initiatives in multiple jurisdictions. The XRP Ledger can process transactions in 3-5 seconds with fees typically under $0.01, making it attractive for institutional payment applications. The partnership aligns with Ripple’s broader strategy to position XRPL as the infrastructure of choice for regulated financial institutions entering the digital asset space. This integration allows the bank to explore new use cases, such as using the stablecoin for trading collateral. It also mirrors similar regulatory wins in the sector, such as the recent approvals for Stripe’s crypto bridge , showcasing how compliance is opening doors for big players. Story Continues However, it is worth noting that while the infrastructure is being built, volume for tokenized assets on XRPL has had to catch up to other chains. This launch could be the catalyst needed to boost liquidity.

On January 28, The Southern Company (NYSE:SO) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.74 per share on its common stock. Payment is scheduled for March 6, this year, to shareholders of record on February 17. Southern Company (SO) Maintains Stability Amid Shifting Landscape Pixabay/Public Domain This announcement continues 78 consecutive years of quarterly dividends equal to or greater than the prior quarter. The 74 cents-per-share payment was first declared in April 2025, marking the 24th consecutive annual increase. At the time, CEO Christopher Womack cited employee dedication and predictable growth from state-regulated utilities and long-term contracts as the main reason for the increase. In a different update, on January 20, Wells Fargo analyst Shahriar Pourreza downgraded Southern’s shares from Equal Weight to Underweight and slashed the price target to $84 from $97. Pourreza tied the shift to heightened political volatility in Georgia, following November elections that saw Democrats take two Republican-held seats on the state Public Service Commission. He insisted the decision is not a reflection of management’s ability to execute, and described the leadership as one of the best in the industry. Pourreza recognized Southern’s robust and diverse load growth pipeline in the South East (primarily in Georgia), which is driven by DC’s and industrial manufacturing. That said, Pourreza cautioned that the 2026 election cycle stands to generate more noise and uncertainty for the regulatory construct in Georgia. The Southern Company (NYSE:SO) is an Atlanta, Georgia-based energy utility that provides electricity to 9 million customers through its subsidiaries across the Southeast. The company operates a diverse portfolio of generation assets, including natural gas, coal, nuclear, and renewable facilities. While we acknowledge the potential of SO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

(NYSE: DLR ) is one of the best infrastructure stocks to buy right now . On February 6, 2026, TD Cowen raised its price target on Digital Realty (NYSE:DLR) to $185 from $179 while keeping a Hold rating. The firm cited strong Q4 results and the potential for better renewal spreads through 2026, which could lift Core‑FFO/share growth. Digital Realty (DLR) Expands Global Footprint, Faces EPS Miss Studio Grand Ouest/Shutterstock.com On the same day, February 6, 2026, Citi lowered its price target on Digital Realty to $190 from $212 but maintained a Buy rating. Citi said Q4 results showed progress with bookings and funding, but adjusted the target to reflect lower valuation multiples. Digital Realty reported its Q4 and full‑year 2025 results on February 5, 2026. EPS came in at $0.24, missing analyst estimates of $0.29 by about 17%, while revenue beat expectations at $1.63 billion versus the forecast of $1.58 billion. The company booked $400 million in Q4, bringing full‑year bookings to $1.2 billion. Same‑capital cash NOI grew 4.5% year‑over‑year, and liquidity stood at $7 billion at year‑end. Digital Realty now operates over 300 data centers across 55+ metro areas, with 3 gigawatts of IT capacity in place and 769 megawatts under construction. CEO Andy Power highlighted AI adoption as a major driver, noting power availability as a key constraint. In 2025, Digital Realty expanded into Indonesia and Malaysia, launched its Private AI Exchange (AIPx), and raised $3.2 billion in its first private capital fund. The company also reported over $15 billion of capital available for hyperscale development, with more than 5 gigawatts of future capacity planned. Digital Realty Trust, Inc.

(NYSE: AWK ) is one of the best infrastructure stocks to buy right now . On February 10, shareholders of American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK) and Essential Utilities Inc. (NYSE:WTRG) approved merger-related proposals at special meetings held that day. American Water Works (AWK) Expands Scale with Essential Utilities Merger According to American Water, at least 99% of its shares present voted to approve share issuance for the merger. Nearly 95% of Essential Utilities shares voted in favor of the merger agreement. The all-stock, tax-free merger, announced October 26, 2025, combines the two largest US regulated water and wastewater utilities into one serving over 4.7 million connections across 17 states. The combined company will retain the American Water name and will be headquartered in Camden, New Jersey. Closing is expected by the end of Q1 2027, subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust clearance, public utility commission approvals in multiple states, including Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and other conditions. Separately, on January 12, 2026, BofA Securities lifted American Water stock from Underperform to Neutral and boosted its price target to $139 from $117. BofA highlighted the stock’s depressed pricing versus electric and gas counterparts, where its earnings multiple edge has narrowed from above 140% historically to below 25% currently. The firm anticipated the ongoing merger would counter issues tied to customer bill burdens and the durability of EPS expansion outlook. BofA contended that American Water’s extended 50-to-100-year pipeline upgrades deserve a valuation lift over electric utilities, which share roughly 9% EPS trajectories but hinge on accelerated construction for data center clients. American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK) is a regulated water utility that provides drinking water and wastewater services to approximately 14 million people in 24 states. The company operates pipeline infrastructure totaling more than 54,500 miles, serving around 1,700 communities.

(NASDAQ: XEL ) is one of the best infrastructure stocks to buy right now . On February 13, UBS upgraded Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL) from Neutral to Buy and increased its price target to $89 from $81. Analyst William Appicelli made the upgrade. Analysts Turn Bullish on Xcel Energy (XEL) Amid Data Center Boom Appicelli noted that Xcel has a steady 9% earnings-per-share expansion, backed by full regulatory oversight, plus rising data center electricity needs that remain underappreciated in the current valuation. The analyst also highlighted Xcel’s recent hike in expected data center load to 4 gigawatts from 2 gigawatts. Further upside came from transmission work in the SPP market, and Colorado plans adding 2.1 gigawatts, said Appicelli. As a result, UBS baked in a 7% premium to the sector average for its model. The firm is also eyeing two turns of P/E multiple gains, and dismissed Texas Smokehouse fire resolution costs as under $100 million. Independent of the analyst action, Xcel shared Q4 2025 results on February 5, in which ongoing EPS was $0.96 per share. This figure fell at the lower end of Wall Street’s estimated range, and was up 18.5% year over year. According to the earnings report, quarterly revenue hit $3.56 billion, which narrowly missed the $3.64-$3.77 billion forecast. Nonetheless, the revenue jumped 14.1% year over year. Management attributed the growth to a 14.2% increase in electric and natural gas sales. The company reaffirmed FY2026 ongoing EPS of $4.04-$4.16 and a long-term 6-8+% annual growth through 2030 via $60 billion capex. Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL) is a regulated utility company. It provides electricity and natural gas to 3.7 million electric customers and 2.1 million natural gas customers across eight states.

I’m an observer of Bitcoin. While Solomon maintained that he owns minimal personal Bitcoin holdings, Goldman Sachs has been cautious in its institutional cryptocurrency strategy. But the bank’s expanding presence in the cryptocurrency sector has been evident. Recently, the bank relaunched its cryptocurrency trading desk and has been actively developing digital asset custody solutions for institutional investors. According to recent SEC filings, Goldman Sachs has built a position of over $2.3 billion in crypto ETFs. Interestingly, the bank holds nearly equal amounts of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. DISCOVER: Top 20 Crypto to Buy in 2026 “Until 10 minutes ago, the regulatory structure was extremely prohibitive” “When you burden this system with excessive regulation, you start to extract capital,” Solomon said. “That absolutely happened in the last five years.” Goldman Sach’s cryptocurrency division serves hedge funds, asset managers, and other institutional clients seeking exposure to Bitcoin and other digital assets through regulated financial products. This client-focused strategy allows Goldman to capitalize on growing institutional demand without requiring executive-level personal conviction. Solomon’s admission fits a growing pattern of acceptance spread across the highest levels of finance. Recently, a BlackRock executive publicly endorsed crypto allocations , reinforcing the idea that Wall Street is moving from “testing the waters” to diving in.

On January 26, Jefferies’ Julian Dumoulin-Smith lowered his price target on Sempra (NYSE:SRE) to $89 from $95 and kept the Hold recommendation intact. The analyst cited California risks as the reason for the price target reduction. Sempra (SRE) Confronts Legal Uncertainty, Analysts Adjust Targets The adjustment stems from new legal challenges facing SoCalGas, a Sempra unit, over its response to the Eaton fire. This challenge, said Dumoulin-Smith, heightens overall operational uncertainties for the company. The analyst observed that investors previously saw Sempra’s California operations as less exposed to wildfires than competitors, but this perception is now shifting due to this case. As a result, the analyst also trimmed projections to account for changes in California’s capital cost assumptions and outcomes from the track two regulatory process. In a separate update, on January 22, BMO Capital analyst James Thalacker cut the price target on Sempra (NYSE:SRE) to $100 from $103 and reaffirmed an Outperform rating. Thalacker labeled the stock’s recent plunge an overreaction to Southern California Edison’s lawsuit accusing SoCalGas of mishandling the Eaton fire. According to the analyst, he took into account initial fire damage projections and the fact that over 12 defendants face similar claims. As such, Thalacker adjusted downward his projections for Sempra’s California utility segment. He also predicted investor skepticism would linger until Sempra files its defense in the litigation. Sempra (NYSE:SRE) is a San Diego, California-based energy infrastructure company. It provides electricity and natural gas to nearly 40 million consumers across North America.

(NYSE: CCI ) is one of the best infrastructure stocks to buy right now . On February 9, Citizens analyst Greg Miller reaffirmed a Market Outperform rating and $125 price target on Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) following Q4 2025 results. Crown Castle (CCI) Faces DISH Fallout, Analysts Split on Outlook Aleksandr Bagri/Shutterstock.com Miller attributed quarterly headwinds to ongoing disputes with former DISH Network clients after tower agreement terminations. He noted DISH as a recent top growth driver, now contributing about 5% of site rental income. The analyst added that stripping out DISH and Sprint effects, revenue rose 3.5%, and that this trails the firm’s long-term benchmarks. ​Miller anticipated leasing momentum to lift expansion ahead, and observed that “the growth days of the towers are now behind.” He framed Crown Castle as a low-volatility counterbalance to data center exposure in digital infrastructure portfolios. Separately, on February 6, BMO Capital analyst Ari Klein reduced the price target on Crown Castle to $91 from $97 while upholding an Outperform rating. Klein deemed Crown Castle’s FY2026 forecast underwhelming, which he noted was driven by heavier-than-anticipated fallout from DISH Network. According to Klein, DISH’s exit hampered organic growth projections. Also, leasing volumes face a modest dip, excluding DISH. Crown Castle considers roughly 3% organic growth, including Sprint churn, as its minimum, but BMO expects limited near-term gains. As a result, Klein projected initial share weakness on the outlook yet viewed it as clearing hurdles. He added that Crown Castle is primed to gain most from any DISH accord amid timing unknowns.

However, this EPS was down 7.8% year over year due to higher taxes, contracting costs, depreciation, and interest expenses, noted management.

On February 11, Goldman Sachs lifted its price target on Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) to $142 from $141 while retaining a Buy rating. Duke Energy (DUK) Advances Strategy Amid Rising Demand Trends Pixbabay/Public Domain ​Goldman focused on Duke’s updated five-year capital investment blueprint totaling $103 billion. The blueprint is a jump from the prior $87 billion forecast, and, according to Duke, it is set to drive 9.6% compound annual rate base expansion through 2030. The bank noted that Duke’s management reiterated EPS growth guidance of 5%-7% annually through 2030. They expect the acceleration toward the top half beginning in 2028, fueled by data center contributions. Goldman viewed this outlook as conservative and projected closer to 8% average EPS advancement over the horizon. This growth, said the bank, will be bolstered by potential for stronger-than-expected electricity demand growth. On the same day, that is February 11, BTIG analyst Alex Kania reaffirmed a Buy rating and $141 price target on Duke. Kania pointed to Duke’s Q4 adjusted EPS of $1.50 that nearly matched BTIG and consensus estimates of $1.49. This performance underscores Duke’s reliable history of hitting targets and delivering on strategy, stated Kania. Kania also praised Duke’s expansions to its generation assets and Energy Supply Agreement backlog, paired with a “de-risked approach” to data center development plans. Although he flagged the updated financing strategy, doubling equity issuances, as “an area worth monitoring,” Kania upheld optimism on overall execution.

This will give investors regulated access to Sui Network’s native token and approximately 7% staking rewards. Both funds hold physical SUI tokens and stake them on Sui Network’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validation mechanism. The Canary Staked SUI ETF (NASDAQ: SUIS) and Grayscale Sui Staking ETF (GSUI) on NYSE Arca represent a major expansion of crypto ETF products beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Commenting on the move, Steven McClurg, CEO at Canary Capital said, “The Canary Staked SUI spot ETF (SUIS) brings exposure to SUI in a registered, exchanged-traded structure, while also enabling investors to benefit from net staking rewards generated through SUI’s proof-of-stake mechanism.” DISCOVER: Top 20 Crypto to Buy in 2026 “Sui Network Represents The Evolution Of Blockchain Utility” Net staking rewards currently yield around 7% are reflected in each fund’s net asset value (NAV), allowing shareholders to capture both price appreciation and on-chain yields without managing validators themselves. Grayscale’s GSUI charges a 0.35% annual sponsor fee, waived for the first three months or until assets reach $1 billion. The fund launched with 100% of holdings staked. Canary filed for SUIS in March 2025 and received SEC approval, following the precedent set by spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 and Ethereum ETFs in 2025. “The Sui Network represents the evolution of blockchain utility. It’s highly scalable, supported by robust developer activity, and designed for real-world adoption,” said McClurg. Adding to this, Adeniyi Abiodun, Co-Founder and CPO of Mysten Labs, the original contributor to Sui said, “Today marks an important milestone for both institutional and retail access to the Sui ecosystem.

The company said roughly 8% is “locked in” through final investment decision projects alongside modest gathering and processing expansion. Williams announced during the presentation that it won approval on “Socrates The Younger” power initiative and site extensions. This boosted the power backlog to 6 gigawatts from an implied 5 gigawatts and lengthened two contracts to 12.5 years from 10. The company also detailed that it carries $12 billion in active construction contracts and a $37 billion opportunity pipeline. It also holds roughly 10 gigawatts in equipment orders for an extra $14 billion shadow-shadow backlog. In this light, Wells Fargo forecasted a 12% EBITDA CAGR across seven years, which surpassed the Williams guide. Independent of the analyst action, on February 6, Reuters revealed that Williams is exploring the acquisition of US natural gas production assets. The move aims to secure natural gas supplies for its one-stop energy services to hyperscalers and AI data center developers, Reuters said in an exclusive report.

For the fourth quarter, the company’s net income reached $316.6 million, or $0.97 per share, which compares to the $453.5 million, or $1.43 per share, posted in Q4 2024. WEC Energy initiated a 2026 guidance range of $5.51-$5.61 and forecasted a 6.5%-7% EPS compound annual growth rate this year. For the longer term, the company expects a growth of 7%-8% off the midpoint. Mizuho believes that management’s confidence in future growth is a great boost for investor sentiment, which is why the firm lifted its price target on the shares. Separately, on the same day, February 6, Scotiabank reaffirmed its Sector Outperform rating on WEC Energy Group and kept the $140 price target. The bank said that strong growth prospects driven by increasing data center demand was the key factor supporting its decision. The analysts highlighted WEC’s remarkable track record of exceeding earnings guidance. They also noted that the company has surpassed original EPS guidance midpoints for 22 consecutive years, and expressed confidence in WEC’s guidance of 7%-8% growth. WEC Energy Group, Inc. (NYSE:WEC) is a Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based utility holding company that provides electricity and natural gas to 4.7 million customers across the Midwest. The company operates regulated utilities and transmission networks, mainly through its WEC Infrastructure segment.

On February 12, DA Davidson began coverage of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), issuing it a Buy rating and a $450 price target. The firm stated that the company’s “compounding execution moat in leading edge manufacturing” results in a “durable, self-reinforcing advantage” as interest in artificial intelligence processing grows. Taiwan Semi’s competitive edge, according to DA Davidson, comes from its capacity to “repeatedly industrialize architectural transitions into predictable, high volume platforms,” pointing out that consumers ultimately choose timely delivery of products at a reasonable cost. Although rivals can match specific characteristics “on paper,” the firm states that Taiwan Semi’s advantage lies in its capacity to transform new devices and power architectures into “high yield, high throughput manufacturing with validated enablement and predictable ramps.” Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is a leading Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturer.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid · Reuters Reuters Thu, February 19, 2026 at 3:33 AM CST 2 min read SBUX Feb 18 (Reuters) - Starbucks faced fresh pressure on Wednesday from a coalition of investors including public-sector pension funds that urged shareholders ‌to vote against the reelection of two directors, citing persistent failure ‌to manage labor relations. The move against Starbucks' lead independent director, Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, and Beth ​Ford, chair of the board's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, comes as the company is locked in a prolonged effort to reach a collective agreement with its unionized baristas. More than 3,800 baristas had joined a nationwide strike late last ‌year - marking the longest ⁠work stoppage in its history - as the Starbucks Workers United union pressed for better staffing, more predictable schedules and higher ⁠pay after drawn-out contract talks. The dispute has become a high-profile test for CEO Brian Niccol as he works to revive sales. \"We are concerned that, without a ​constructive ​relationship between Starbucks and its unionized workforce, ​sustaining the turnaround may prove ‌difficult,\" the investors said in a letter ahead of the March 25 annual meeting. New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, New York City Comptroller Mark Levine, Trillium ESG Global Equity Mutual Fund, SOC Investment Group, Merseyside Pension Fund and the Shareholder Association for Research and Education are all signatories. \"We offer the ‌best job in retail with hourly partners earning ​an average of $30 an hour and world-class ​benefits... all for those who ​only work 20 hours a week on average,\" Starbucks ‌said in a statement. The investor group had, ​in January, written ​to the two directors raising concerns over the board's elimination of its Environmental, Partner, and Community Impact Committee without explanation. The committee's responsibilities were reallocated ​across existing committees ‌and the full board reclaimed primary responsibility for labor oversight, Starbucks ​told Reuters on Wednesday.

The iconic S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has gained at least 16% in all but one year since 2019. Meanwhile, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) just eclipsed 50,000 for the first time in its nearly 130-year history, and the technology-driven Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) has consistently delivered outsize returns. There has been no shortage of catalysts fueling this upside, including the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) , the advent of quantum computing, the prospect of additional interest rate cuts, and record share buyback activity from S&P 500 companies. Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » Image source: Getty Images. But if history has proven anything, it's that when things seem too good to be true for the stock market, they often are. The benchmark S&P 500 just did something that investors haven't witnessed in more than a quarter century -- and there's no mistaking the message behind this event . This hasn't been observed since the dot-com bubble burst Before going any further, it's worth pointing out that historical correlations can't guarantee short-term directional moves in the Dow, S&P 500, or Nasdaq Composite. Nevertheless, some events have statistically correlated very strongly with directional moves in Wall Street's major stock indexes. It's these historical correlations that tend to raise eyebrows among investors. One historically correlated indicator of intrigue concerns S&P 500 drawdowns. Using data from Bloomberg Finance, investing podcast The Compound labeled every instance since 2000 in which 115 (or more) of the 500 companies that comprise the benchmark index endured at least a 7% single-session drawdown over a rolling eight-day trading period. As you can imagine, instances of heightened downside volatility frequently occurred during short-lived crash events, such as the COVID-19 crash and the week following the unveiling of President Donald Trump's tariff and trade policy, as well as toward the tail-end of bear markets. Over 26 years, the average S&P 500 drawdown from its high was 34% when 115 or more components fell at least 7% in a single session across a rolling eight-day window. Story Continues However, this very specific drawdown indicator just occurred with the S&P 500 only 2% below its all-time high. The only other time since 2000 when 115 or more S&P 500 stocks fell at least 7% over a rolling eight-trading-day window, and the benchmark index was only a few percent below its record high, was the early stages of the dot-com bubble. While nothing is guaranteed, this statistical increase in outsize declines from some of Wall Street's most influential stocks has consistently foreshadowed weakness in equities. This worrisome signal coincides with this being the second-priciest stock market in history, based on readings from the S&P 500's Shiller Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio. The previous five instances in which the Shiller P/E exceeded 30 for at least two months, dating back to January 1871, eventually resulted in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and/or Nasdaq Composite shedding 20% to 89% of their value. Statistically, Wall Street's bull market looks to be running on borrowed time. Image source: Getty Images. Time and perspective can change everything on Wall Street Although headwinds appear to be mounting for the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite, the outlook for these indexes can vary greatly depending on investors' perspectives and investment timelines. To be blunt, stock market corrections, bear markets, and crash events are normal, healthy, and inevitable. No policy maneuvering from the Federal Reserve or government, nor well-wishing from investors, can stop these often emotion-propelled moves lower in Wall Street's major stock indexes. But taking a step back and recognizing the nonlinearity of stock market cycles is foundational to being a successful investor. Recently, analysts at Bespoke Investment Group published a data set on X (formerly Twitter) that calculated the calendar-day length of every S&P 500 bull and bear market, dating back to the start of the Great Depression in September 1929. What Bespoke's data highlights is the clear disparity in length between bull and bear markets. On one end of the spectrum, the typical 20% or greater decline in the S&P 500 has resolved in 286 calendar days, or about 9.5 months. What's more, no bear market has endured longer than 630 calendar days. In comparison, the average S&P 500 bull market has persisted approximately 3.5 times as long (1,011 calendar days), with 10 of the 27 bull markets spanning 96 years lasting more than 1,200 calendar days. Statistically, wagering on the stock market's major indexes to rise over time has been a wise decision. This means any significant decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite serves as a surefire buying opportunity for investors willing to stay the course for years, if not decades. If history repeats with the S&P 500's drawdown indicator, bargains may abound for investors in the not-too-distant future. Should you buy stock in S&P 500 Index right now?

      "content": "DoorDash sees strong quarterly growth in sales and orders but warns of big costs DEE-ANN DURBIN Updated Thu, February 19, 2026 at 3:38 AM CST 2 min read DASH ROO.L DoorDash ( DASH ) stock rose 13% during premarket hours on Thursday after announcing on Wednesday that its revenue rose 38% in the fourth quarter as it gained new U.S. customers and added new services like restaurant reservations . But the San Francisco-based delivery company also warned of costly investments ahead. DoorDash CEO and Co-founder Tony Xu said DoorDash is in the midst of building a single tech platform that will bring together its many international businesses. DoorDash bought Wolt , a Finnish delivery service, in 2022, and it acquired Deliveroo , a U.K. rival, last year. Xu said the majority of the tech platform will be completed this year, and even before it's complete, the company will save money and time because it will be able to roll out updates to all of its markets at once. But in the meantime, Xu called the new platform “a massive and expensive undertaking.” “I wish that the tech stack were already here,” Xu said during a conference call with investors Thursday. DoorDash said it expects adjusted pretax earnings between $675 million and $775 million in the first quarter, which was lower than the $800.6 million Wall Street was expecting, according to analysts polled by FactSet. DoorDash also spent heavily during the fourth quarter on multiple projects, including the development of autonomous robot delivery and drone delivery . Its research and development costs rose 41%, for example, while its sales and marketing costs jumped 31%. DoorDash’s net income rose 51% to $213 million, or 49 cents per share. That was lower than the 59-cent profit Wall Street anticipated. DoorDash reported revenue of $3.96 billion for the October-December period. That was also less than the $3.99 billion that analysts forecast. Still, total orders rose 32% to 903 million, beating analysts’ forecast of 884.8 million, according to FactSet. DoorDash said it had more than 56 million active users during the quarter, including 35 million members paying monthly fees to be part of its DashPass, Wolt+ and Deliveroo Plus programs. Xu said customers have always used DoorDash for quick, mid-week orders. But the company is increasingly seeing customers use DoorDash for bigger weekend grocery trips as well. DoorDash and Kroger, the largest U.S. grocery chain, expanded their delivery partnership last fall. Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard More Info",

      "content": "Trying to Cut Retirement Taxes? Avoid This Common Strategy Brian O'Connor Thu, February 19, 2026 at 3:00 AM CST 5 min read MORN Want to Minimize Retirement Taxes? Don't Follow This Popular Strategy If you’re planning on making tax-deferred retirement accounts the last pot of money you tap after retirement, you’ve got a lot of company. And why not? The idea that your 401(k) or traditional IRA can keep growing and churning out more tax-deferred money seems like a sound strategy. But you may want to rethink this conventional wisdom. Instead of focusing on deferring taxes, Morningstar’s Mark Miller suggests looking at how to minimize your overall total taxes during retirement – which can mean tapping tax-deferred accounts first. A financial advisor can help you decide on an order in which to tap your retirement accounts. “The idea is to use dollars in 401(k) or IRA accounts to meet living expenses — or convert a portion of these assets to Roth IRA accounts — before claiming Social Security in years when your marginal tax rate is lower than it will be after you start to receive benefit,” Miller writes. Tax Considerations in Retirement Want to Minimize Retirement Taxes? Don't Follow This Popular Strategy One consideration Miller highlights is the fact that collecting Social Security benefits while making withdrawals from tax-deferred retirement accounts will very likely mean you’ll pay taxes on your Social Security benefits. Single tax filers who bring in between $25,000 and $34,000 in what the IRS calls “combined income” can be taxed on 50% of their Social Security benefits. Meanwhile, those who earn over $34,000 in combined income will pay taxes on up to 85% of their benefits. The limits for joint tax filers are $32,000 and $44,000. (Combined income is your adjusted gross income, plus nontaxable interest income from bonds and half of your Social Security benefits.) As Miller notes, when Social Security benefits first became taxable in 1984 and then extended in 1994, the legislation didn’t include adjustments to the income levels that trigger what some advisers call the “tax torpedo.” This refers to the combined effect that earned income and Social Security have on a retiree’s tax liability. “The original idea was to tax only relatively high-income beneficiaries, and that remains the case. But the number of people affected is rising. That’s because Social Security benefits are indexed to wage growth and adjusted for inflation, while the income threshold levels used to determine the taxable amount of Social Security benefits are fixed by law and not indexed for wage growth or inflation. What You Can Do Want to Minimize Retirement Taxes? Don't Follow This Popular Strategy Aside from drawing down tax-deferred accounts before claiming Social Security, one way to sidestep this “tax torpedo” is by having Roth assets. Remember, for someone in the 22% tax bracket, each $1 of compounded earnings in a taxable 401(k) or traditional IRA yields just 78 cents – plus the potential tax triggered on Social Security benefits. But every $1 of compounded earnings in a tax-free Roth IRA equates to $1 of retirement income. And because it’s non-taxable, it doesn’t count toward your combined income. Story Continues One of the many considerations for retirees is figuring out how to complete Roth conversions in the most tax-efficient manner possible. Doing so will mean you’ll have more tax-free money to draw upon without adding to your combined income. But you’ll want to keep the amount of money you convert low enough so you’re only subject to the lowest income tax brackets. Alternatively, you could rely strictly on cash from taxable accounts to meet living expenses early in retirement, allowing yourself to delay Social Security benefits. Remember, Social Security increases by 8% every year between your full retirement age (67 for most people today) and age 70. A financial advisor can help you weigh your options for your retirement income strategy. Figuring out how to make this work means each individual will need to run their own numbers, a task that’s not too difficult for people projecting the impact of withdrawals from an IRA plus collecting Social Security benefits. People with additional concerns or complex situations can consult with a financial advisor or tax planner. They can also turn to a lower-cost service like Income Strategy, which calculates Social Security and drawdown sequencing, as Miller notes. Bottom Line Tapping your tax-deferred assets first can help lower your total tax burden in retirement, Morningstar’s Mark Miller writes. This flies in the face of conventional wisdom, which dictates you withdraw tax-deferred assets last, allowing them to continue to grow. But this alternative strategy allows you to defer Social Security and maximize your future benefit. Roth conversions are another way you can generate tax-free income in retirement that won’t add to your combined income. Tax Planning Tips A financial advisor can help you plan for retirement taxes and offer advice on how to draw down your assets in a tax-efficient manner. Finding a financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you’re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now. If you’re focused on limiting your tax liability in retirement, you may be thinking about moving to a more tax-friendly state. SmartAsset has a retirement tax-friendliness tool designed to help you identify the states that are most and least tax-friendly for retirees. Keep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks .

      "content": "Centrica Earnings Slide as Investments Drive Strategic Reset Charles Kennedy Thu, February 19, 2026 at 2:49 AM CST 4 min read CPYYF Centrica plc posted lower earnings in 2025 but raised its dividend and pressed ahead with major investments as it targets a step-up in EBITDA by 2030. The UK-based energy and services group reported adjusted EBITDA of £1.4 billion for 2025, down from £2.3 billion in 2024, with adjusted operating profit falling to £814 million from £1.6 billion. Adjusted earnings per share declined to 11.2p from 19.0p a year earlier, reflecting weaker commodity pricing, nuclear outages, and subdued trading conditions. Más de Yahoo Scout Why did Centrica's earnings fall significantly in 2025? What is Centrica's strategy for transforming its portfolio? How much is Centrica investing in nuclear projects? What are Centrica's EBITDA targets through 2030? Statutory results were hit harder. Operating profit fell to £0.1 billion from £1.7 billion in 2024, as Centrica booked £0.7 billion in exceptional charges and remeasurement losses on energy derivatives, alongside £0.5 billion in impairments tied to late-life gas fields and nuclear investments outside Sizewell C. The group reported a statutory loss per share of 1.5p, compared with a 25.7p profit in 2024. Despite the earnings decline, Centrica increased its full-year dividend by 22% to 5.5p per share, up from 4.5p in 2024, in line with its progressive dividend policy. The company returned £1.1 billion to shareholders in 2025, including £0.8 billion via share buybacks and £0.2 billion in dividends, and completed a £2 billion buyback program before pausing further repurchases to prioritize investment opportunities. Net operating cash flow fell to £0.7 billion from £1.1 billion in 2024, while free cash flow swung to a £0.2 billion outflow, reflecting a sharp increase in capital expenditure to £1.2 billion—more than double the prior year’s £0.6 billion. Adjusted net cash declined to £1.5 billion from £2.9 billion, although the balance sheet remains robust. Retail adjusted EBITDA held steady at £0.6 billion, supported by cost discipline and improved performance in Home Services, offsetting weaker UK Home Energy Supply earnings. The company reported customer growth across all retail businesses for the first time in more than a decade, alongside improved customer satisfaction metrics. Optimisation—encompassing gas and power trading—saw adjusted EBITDA halve to £0.2 billion amid challenging market conditions. Infrastructure earnings dropped more sharply. Adjusted EBITDA fell to £0.7 billion from £1.4 billion, reflecting lower realized commodity prices, the pause in Rough gas storage operations, and nuclear outages. Centrica’s 2025 strategy focused on repositioning the portfolio toward more stable, infrastructure-like earnings. The group committed £1.3 billion (capped) to the 3.2 GW Sizewell C nuclear project, securing a real allowed return on equity of 10.8% and targeting a double-digit internal rate of return. It expects the project to build an £8 billion regulated asset base by commercial operation. Leer más The company also acquired a 50% stake in the Grain LNG terminal alongside Energy Capital Partners, investing £0.2 billion in equity for an expected unlevered IRR of around 9%, with potential upside from site expansion. In parallel, Centrica continued reshaping its upstream exposure, divesting most of Spirit Energy’s producing assets except the Morecambe Hub, and extending operating lives at Heysham 1 and Hartlepool nuclear plants to March 2028. It also formalized a partnership with X-energy to explore advanced modular reactor deployment in the UK. Looking ahead, Centrica is targeting £1.7 billion in adjusted EBITDA by the end of 2028, rising to £2.0 billion by 2030, supported by its transformation program, incremental infrastructure investment, and anticipated nuclear life extensions. The guidance midpoint allows for ±£0.3 billion annual volatility. The strategy aligns with broader UK energy policy trends, emphasizing energy security, nuclear expansion, and LNG import resilience following years of gas market volatility. By reallocating capital from upstream production to regulated and contracted infrastructure, Centrica is seeking to reduce earnings cyclicality and improve long-term visibility. While 2025 marked a step down from the windfall conditions of prior years, management framed the year as one of structural repositioning—trading near-term earnings strength for long-duration, infrastructure-backed cash flows.

(NASDAQ: NBIS ) is one of the best stocks to buy and hold for the next 6 months . On February 10, Nebius Group NV (NASDAQ:NBIS) reached an agreement to acquire Tavily. With the acquisition, the company gains access to a company that develops software to help artificial intelligence agents search for up-to-date information needed for financial trading and coding. Nebius Group N.V. (NBIS) Strengthens AI Platform With $275M Tavily Deal According to people familiar with the matter, Nebius is to pay $275 million as part of the deal, which will also see Tavily founder and CEO Rotem Weiss join the company. The acquisition will strengthen the company’s efforts to offer software for handling AI workloads while also providing access to open-source models. Additionally, the acquisition will advance Nebius’ strategy of building a unified platform that enables vertical AI companies and enterprises to build, tune, and run autonomous agents. By leveraging Tavily’s agentic search solution, Nebius will also expand its integrated software stack that developers need to assemble and operate enterprise-grade agentic systems. “This acquisition brings the search layer directly into our stack, so developers can focus on their applications instead of managing multiple vendors. Our strategy is clear: provide an open platform that serves everyone from startups to the largest enterprises, giving them the tools to own their AI destiny,” Roman Chernin, co-founder and Chief Business Officer of Nebius, said: Nebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ:NBIS) is focused on building full-stack infrastructure for the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. It provides AI-native cloud computing, large-scale GPU clusters, and developer tools for training and running AI models. While we acknowledge the potential of NBIS as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

(NASDAQ: CRWV ) is one of the best stocks to buy and hold for the next 6 months . On February 6, CoreWeave Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV) launched its first big brand campaign called “Ready for Anything, Ready for AI” with Chance the Rapper as the face of it. The campaign shows CoreWeave’s new vision of helping people and companies who are building with AI to go further and innovate faster. CoreWeave Inc. (CRWV) Eyes Opportunities in Validating AI Performance and Costs As AI moves from testing to large-scale use, CoreWeave wants to highlight its role as the backbone for AI projects. The campaign explains how its cloud technology is built to handle big ideas and future growth. With recent acquisitions like Weights & Biases, OpenPipe, and Monolith, CoreWeave is uniting everything under one clear brand identity while continuing to grow quickly. A day earlier on February 5, CoreWeave Inc. unveiled a new solution designed to help organizations validate the performance and costs of artificial intelligence workloads before deployment. CoreWeave ARENA is a new platform that enables testing applications on production-scale infrastructure. It replaces traditional sandbox environments by providing production-scale compute paired with standardized evaluation tools. The platform also provides access to the company’s Mission Control operating system and AI-native infrastructure through the SUNK and CKS platforms. Customers are already reporting performance improvements and cost reductions on leveraging CoreWeave ARENA capabilities. One customer experienced a significant reduction in cost of ownership, while another saw 10 times faster training than with cloud services running on GPU hardware. “Companies are now building products that have to perform in the real world, and quickly. But there’s been a gap between testing a model and actually running it at scale. CoreWeave ARENA closes that gap,” said Chen Goldberg, Senior Vice President of Engineering at CoreWeave.

On February 2, research firm Leerink Partners downgraded BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) to a Market Perform from an Outperform and set a $113 price target. BioNTech SE (BNTX) Rallying on Solid Oncology Strategy Pixabay/Public Domain The downgrade is in response to the stock rallying from its December lows of $92 to $113. The 24% gain over the same period outpaced the 4% gain of the S&P Biotechnology Select Industry. According to Leerink Partners, the new rating and price target bring the stock in line with its discounted cash flow valuation. Despite the downgrade, the research firm remains confident about BioNTech’s long-term prospects with its oncology strategy. The firm is especially confident about pumitamig, a VEGFA/PD-L1 bispecific antibody partnered with Bristol Myers Squibb. The company remains in a strong financial position with $20.3 billion in cash expected to support the development of the oncology pipeline. Earlier on January 28, the company’s Supervisory Board appointed Kylie Jimenez to the Management Board as Chief People Officer (“CPO”). The appointment aligns with the company’s push to become a multi-product oncology company by 2030. Jimenez will be responsible for shaping and leading BioNTech’s people strategy and its execution. On January 21, BioNTech said the FDA gave Fast Track status to its cancer drug BNT113 for HPV16+ head and neck cancer. The decision is based on early trial results, and the drug is being tested with pembrolizumab to improve survival for patients who currently have limited treatment options.

(CIFR)’s Outlook According to the investment bank, Cipher Mining is one of the Bitcoin mining companies well-positioned to benefit from a pivot to data centers. The investment bank expects Bitcoin companies with established data centers to naturally attract infrastructure investors who value long-term, stable cash flows. Consequently, Morgan Stanley compares Cipher Mining’s business model to data center REITs that trade at 20X EV/FY1 EBITDA. Meanwhile, on February 4, the company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Black Perl Compute LLC, completed a $2 billion 6.125% senior secured note due 2031. The unit is to use net proceeds from the offering to finance the construction costs of the Black Pearl Facility, a high-performance computing data center in Texas. It will also use $232.5 million to reimburse Cipher Mining for its prior equity contribution. Cipher Mining Inc.

On February 9, Harmony Gold Mining Company Ltd (NYSE:HMY) confirmed that its newly acquired CSA Copper Mine in Australia requires a capital injection and a strategic rethink. Harmony Gold Mining Company Ltd. (HMY) Faces Challenges With CSA Copper Mine Copyright: tomas1111 / 123RF Stock Photo The company took over the CSA mine in New South Wales last October by acquiring Mac Copper in a deal worth $1.03 billion. The acquisition is part of the company’s push to diversify into copper, as gold mining in South Africa becomes extremely costly due to the depth of the country’s mines. Under Mac Copper, CSA Copper Mine produced 40,000 metric tons of copper per year. However, it is still unclear if it can maintain or increase the output. “It could be up to two years or even more potentially to de-risk and de-bottleneck the mine,” Chief Executive Beyers Nel said. “It is a mine that is constrained at the moment. It is a mine that requires a bit of a rethink and recapitalisation.” Harmony Gold also owns Eva Copper in Queensland, Australia, and is a joint owner with Newmont of Wafi-Golpu, a gold-copper project in Papua New Guinea. Harmony Gold Mining Company Ltd. (NYSE:HMY) is a major, experienced gold producer and specialist with extensive operations in South Africa and Papua New Guinea, and a growing copper portfolio in Australia.

The hedge fund returned about 30% annually without a single down year during that period. Today, Druckenmiller only manages his own money through Duquesne Family Office, and he made some interesting trades in the fourth quarter. He sold his stake in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and bought shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , a stock up 210,000% since its IPO in 1997. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks » Importantly, the fourth quarter ended about 45 days ago, so investors need to reevaluate both companies based on current information before making the same trades. Here are the important details. Image source: Getty Images. Meta Platforms: The stock Stanley Druckenmiller sold in the fourth quarter Meta owns the three most popular social media platforms as measured by monthly active users: Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. That affords the company valuable insight into consumer behavior and interests, which supports precise ad targeting. That advantage has helped Meta become the second-largest adtech company in the world. Meta has doubled down on that advantage by investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI). The company has developed machine learning models that retrieve, rank, and recommend content, as well as tools that help advertisers create and optimize campaigns. Additionally, Meta has developed custom chips to train and run the underlying models. Meta reported encouraging financial results in the fourth quarter. Revenue increased 24% to $59.9 billion as more engaging content drove an increase in ad impressions, and better ad performance allowed the company to charge more per ad. However, net income increased just 11% to $8.88 per diluted share, growing more slowly than the top line due to aggressive AI spending. Billionaire Bill Ackman at Pershing Square recently told clients, \"We believe concerns around Meta's AI-related spending initiatives are underestimating the company's long-term upside potential from AI.\" For instance, Meta dominates the nascent smart glasses market and sees an opportunity to combine smart glasses with superintelligence to create a product that could eventually replace many smartphone functions. Wall Street estimates the company's earnings will increase at 19% annually over the next three years, which makes the current valuation of 27 times earnings look quite reasonable. Stanley Druckenmiller may have sold Meta due to concerns about the near-term implications of heavy AI spending, but investors with a time horizon of five years should consider buying a position today. Story continues Amazon: The stock Stanley Druckenmiller bought in the fourth quarter Amazon has a strong position in three large industries: It operates the largest e-commerce marketplace in North America and Western Europe, it is the largest retail advertiser in the world (and the third-largest adtech company overall), and Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest public cloud in terms of infrastructure and platform services spending. Like Meta, Amazon is leaning into strength in its core markets by investing aggressively in AI. The company has developed hundreds of generative AI applications to improve margins across its retail business, including tools that optimize demand forecasting, inventory placement, workforce productivity, robot efficiency, and last-mile delivery routes. Similarly, AWS has introduced new products and services at every layer of the computing stack: custom AI chips for training and inference workloads at the infrastructure layer, developer tools for creating generative AI and machine learning software at the platform layer, and AI agents for coding, performance monitoring, and security at the application layer. The stock is down 12% since the company announced fourth-quarter earnings, primarily because Amazon plans to spend $200 billion on capital expenditures in 2026 , up 56% from 2025. But investments in AI are bearing fruit: In the fourth quarter, AWS sales accelerated to the fastest pace in 13 quarters, driven in part by triple-digit sales growth in custom chips. And excluding one-time charges, operating margin increased 1.5 percentage points. Wall Street expects Amazon's earnings to increase at 17% annually over the next three years, which makes the current valuation of 29 times earnings look attractive. I think Stanley Druckenmiller made the right call in buying shares in the fourth quarter, and long-term investors should consider doing the same right now. Should you buy stock in Amazon right now?

The company is increasingly advancing deployments in Canada and Texas. Amid the expansion drive, on February 6, research firm Citizens reiterated a Market Outperform rating on IREN Ltd and an $80 price target. Citizens have expressed confidence in IREN Ltd’s long-term prospects amid a strategic pivot from Bitcoin mining to providing higher-quality data center capacity to large-scale customers. The company already has over 2 gigawatts of capacity available to pursue contracts with hyperscalers. In addition, IREN has secured a $3.6 billion in GPU financing for its Microsoft contract on February 5. The financing will supplement Microsoft’s $1.9 billion prepayment, thereby allowing the company to cover 95% of GPU-related capital expenditures for its targeted 140,000-GPU expansion. The expansion drive is expected to deliver $3.4 billion in annual recurring revenue. Iren Limited (NASDAQ:IREN) operates data centers powered by renewable energy, specializing in high-performance computing for artificial intelligence (AI) cloud services and Bitcoin mining. The company recently shifted focus to AI infrastructure, securing major deals, including a $9.7 billion partnership with Microsoft.

(NASDAQ: PRAX ) is one of the best stocks to buy and hold for the next 6 months . On February 10, Guggenheim raised its price target for Praxis Precision Medicines Inc. (NASDAQ:PRAX) to $800 from $760 while reiterating a Buy rating. Praxis Precision Medicines, Inc. (PRAX) Gains Analyst Confidence With Ulixacaltamide The research firm raised its price target, impressed by the significant market opportunity for ulixacaltamide, the company’s flagship treatment for essential tremor (ET). According to Guggenheim, Praxis Precision is well-positioned to capitalize on one of the largest and underpenetrated markets in neurology. The essential tremor market is valued at over $15 billion, and Praxis Precision is poised to achieve peak sales of $5- $10 billion with ulixacaltamide. Earlier on January 28, Piper Sandler raised the stock’s price target to $1200 from $450 while maintaining an Overweight rating. The significant price target hike is in response to ulixacaltamide’s significant success in essential tremor. In addition, the research firm has touted progress in relutrigine and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs). The research firm expects the company to achieve more than $20 billion in revenue with less than 5% peak market share. Praxis Precision Medicines, Inc.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Restaurant Dive newsletter . 352 Capital, one of Fat Brands’ creditors, sued the company last week to contest Fat’s attempt to use management fees and other cash to fund operations during the company’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy process. At issue is Fat’s proposed use of securitization receivables, defined as “certain management fees and other residual amounts payable to FAT Brands as manager of the securitization entities,” according to lawsuit. 352 Capital said that it owns these receivables and Fat cannot use this cash to fund its operations. If 352 Capital wins this case, Fat, which owns Fatburger, Round Table Pizza, Fazzoli’s and more than a dozen other chains, could have difficulty paying for its operations during the bankruptcy process. The creditor, which holds over $100 million of Fat’s debt, has taken issue with Fat Brands in the past. Days before Fat Brands filed for bankruptcy protections on Jan. 27, 352 Capital sued the chain, saying it was owed Class B stocks of Twin Hospitality as collateral for unpaid debt, according to Restaurant Business. Fat Brands and Twin Hospitality declared bankruptcy following months of ongoing talks with various creditors related to more than $1 billion in outstanding debt. The case is complicated as it involves five different securitization trusts secured by different brands. A group of creditors filed an emergency motion in early February calling for CEO Andrew Wiederhorn’s ouster after a $3 million sale of Twin Hospitality stock was completed following the bankruptcy petition date and without court approval. While the emergency motion has been tabled after Fat’s lawyers said issues with corporate governance have been addressed, Wiederhorn’s position could still be contested during an upcoming March court date related to the bankruptcy case, according to a Feb. 10 hearing related to Chapter 11 proceedings.

      "content": "Private equity deals hit $2.6T in 2025 Dan Niepow Thu, February 19, 2026 at 3:27 AM MST 3 min read EA This story was originally published on CFO.com . To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily CFO.com newsletter . For private equity, 2025 was a year of longer hold periods and fewer but bigger deals, and some observers say that may well be a “new normal” for the industry. Last year, total private equity deal value hit $2.6 trillion globally, up 19% over 2024, according to McKinsey & Company’s Global Private Markets 2026 report released last week. That marked the second-highest value on record, said McKinsey Senior Partner Alexander Edlich in a webinar on Wednesday. A $55 billion deal to take video game maker Electronic Arts private — said to be the largest PE deal in history — certainly played a role in driving up the overall value of deals last year. That all came even as the total global deal count dropped 9% in 2025, mirroring trends in the wider M&A market . According to McKinsey’s research, deal count has been falling every year after reaching a relative peak of about 80,000 deals in 2021. At the same time, private equity firms are now finding themselves holding onto assets much longer than they have in the past. McKinsey’s research pointed to a backlog of about 16,000 portfolio companies that have been owned by private equity for over four years in 2025. That was up from about 13,000 such companies in 2024. “The backlog of PE-owned companies still on the books has never been bigger,” McKinsey researchers wrote in the report. “Holding periods also remain well above historical levels. The typical company in the portfolio of a general partner is now held on average for more than six and a half years.” In Wednesday’s webinar, Edlich said that, comparatively, that’s essentially like “two holds almost.” Investors and limited partners are, of course, still looking for their return on investment. The use of continuation vehicles, where private equity firms essentially sell their assets back to themselves, proved to be another popular way to do that last year, though the practice is not without controversy . “Liquidity solutions, like GP-led secondary transactions (the majority of which are continuation vehicles), have more than tripled in value in the last five years, rising from $35 billion in 2020 to $115 billion in 2025,” McKinsey officials said, noting that it's estimated that about 14% of all sponsor-backed exits go through continuation vehicles. “…liquidity for investors remains more a trickle than a flood,” they said. “Trends that first appeared to be ‘niche’ or temporary solutions after the dealmaking exuberance of 2020 and 2021, including the growth in secondaries, the rise of continuation vehicles, and the emergence of net asset value lending, now appear to be enduring — even growing—elements of this more technically demanding private equity terrain.” Story Continues McKinsey’s team said the research all shows that private equity is “maturing” as an industry, for better or worse. “Private equity now exhibits many of the signs of a much more mature industry that is much more technical and much more demanding,” Edlich said. “This is not your grandfather or grandmother’s private equity.” As the company put it in the report: “At present, a strong case can be made that the traditional five-year holding period is in the rearview mirror, and new, adaptive liquidity solutions will remain a permanent and significant part of private markets infrastructure going forward.” Recommended Reading McKinsey’s new AI hiring experiment puts pressure on the ‘up-or-out’ model Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard More Info",

It offers a wide range of financial products that help people save, borrow, and invest their money. The stock has been sluggish to start the year and is down by 3%, but its long-term returns are solid. The bank stock is up by more than 50% during the past five years and has a 2.1% dividend yield. Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » This same financial stock is approaching a $400 billion market cap, which will make it harder for the company to deliver life-changing returns for new investors. People who want exposure to the financial sector and a promising long-term pick may want to consider SoFi (NASDAQ: SOFI) instead. Here's why. This small fintech company is delivering tremendous growth Image source: Getty Images. SoFi is larger than most fintech companies , but its $25 billion market cap looks small when you compare it to Bank of America. Its online banking solutions let it offer higher interest rates on deposits and have more competitive products than traditional banks, which have higher overhead costs as a result of operating large networks of physical branch offices. The online bank delivered 40% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter and secured its ninth consecutive quarter of profitability. SoFi's adjusted net income almost tripled year over year. This metric is more valuable than net income for this particular quarter, since SoFi had a one-time income tax benefit in Q4 2024 that distorts the year-over-year net income comparison. SoFi's revenue and net income are growing at faster rates than those of Bank of America and other traditional banks. As more people tap into the benefits of online banking, SoFi should continue to gain market share and wind up with a more attractive price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio over time. Here's what is fueling those numbers SoFi's growth rates are good, and its underlying business suggests it can maintain those gains. The fintech company has 13.7 million customers after adding 1 million new members in Q4. That's the most customers SoFi has added in a single quarter, highlighting the growing mainstream acceptance of online banks. The company is also delivering solid results across multiple product categories. Just like any traditional bank, SoFi helps people save, borrow, and invest money. The company also recently tapped into cryptocurrencies again, which can turn into a long-term tailwind once Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) regains its momentum. SoFi said it closed the year with 63,441 crypto products, which means that many SoFi members are using crypto trading. Story Continues SoFi also saw strong demand across its product categories, with bank accounts, investment accounts, and credit card openings up by 33%, 28%, and 56% year over year, respectively. SoFi's products are getting more popular, and all that visibility directly translates into revenue and net income gains that can help the fintech stock outperform Bank of America and its peers.

Best money market account rates today, February 19, 2026 (earn up to 4.01% APY) Find out which banks are offering the best MMA rates right now. Casey Bond · Lead Editor and Content Strategist, Banking Thu, February 19, 2026 at 4:00 AM MST 4 min read Find out which banks are offering the best MMA rates right now. As interest rates begin to fall following the Fed’s recent rate cuts, it’s more important than ever to ensure you’re earning a competitive rate on your savings. One option you may want to consider is a money market account (MMA). These accounts are similar to savings accounts — they offer interest on your balance, but may also include a debit card and/or check-writing capabilities. Wondering where the top money market account rates can be found today? Here’s what you need to know. What are the best money market account rates today? From a historical perspective, money market account interest rates have been quite high. The national average interest rate for money market accounts is just 0.56%, according to the FDIC, but the top money market account rates often pay above 4% APY or even more — similar to the rates offered on high-yield savings accounts . Here’s a look at some of the top MMA rates available today: TotalBank Online Money Market Deposit Account : 4.01% APY ($2,500 minimum balance required to earn highest rate) Quontic Bank : 4% APY Brilliant Bank Surge Money Market Account : 4% APY ($1,000 minimum balance required to earn highest rate) Northern Bank Direct Mon­ey Mar­ket Pre­mier Account : 4% APY Zynlo Money Market Account : 3.9% APY Redneck Bank Mega Money Market : 3.85% APY EverBank Yield Pledge Money Market Account : 3.8% APY HUSTL Digital Credit Union Money Market : 3.8% First Foundation Bank Online Money Market Account : 3.75% APY ($1,000 minimum balance required to earn highest rate) Prime Alliance Bank Personal Money Market Account : 3.75% APY Will money market account rates keep going down? Between July 2023 and September 2024, the Fed maintained a target range for its federal funds rate of 5.25%–5.50%. However, as inflation cooled and the economy improved, the Fed slashed the federal funds rate three times that year. In 2025, the Fed made three additional rate cuts. As a result the federal funds rate now stands at 3.50% -3.75%. Deposit account rates have been on a steady decline, meaning now might be the last chance for savers to take advantage of today’s higher rates.

Even so, deciding whether it’s the right time to put money in a money market account also depends on your financial goals and the broader economic conditions. Here are some key factors to consider: Liquidity needs: Money market accounts offer easy access to your money since they often come with check-writing capabilities or debit card access (though there may be a cap on monthly withdrawals). If you need to keep your money accessible while still earning a decent yield, a money market account could be ideal. Savings goals: If you have short-term savings goals or want to build an emergency fund, a money market account can provide a safer place for your cash, with returns that are better than most traditional savings accounts. Risk tolerance: For conservative savers who prefer to avoid the ups and downs of the stock market, money market accounts are appealing because they are backed by FDIC insurance and can’t lose principal. However, if you’re saving for a long-term goal like retirement, riskier investments are necessary to generate higher returns that will get you to your savings target. Given that interest rates are still elevated, now could be a good time to consider a money market account, especially if you’re seeking a balance of safety, liquidity, and better returns than traditional savings accounts. Comparing rates from different institutions will help you find the best options available. Today's money market account rates: Frequently asked questions What is the current interest rate on a money market account? Today's money market account rates vary quite a bit across different financial institutions. Though the national average rate for an MMA is currently 0.56%, there are some banks offering well above 4% APY. In general, you won't find money market rates above 4.5%. Where can I get 7% interest on my money? Unfortunately, there are very few accounts that offer 7% interest . Those that do exist are limited-time promotions, and are typically found on checking accounts. There are currently no money market accounts that pay 7%.

      "content": "ICE Is at the Truck Stops. Is Your Hiring Process Ready? Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves) Rob Carpenter Thu, February 19, 2026 at 3:58 AM MST 13 min read On February 18, 2026, FreightWaves founder Craig Fuller reported that ICE agents in sprinter vans are showing up at truck stops and rounding up undocumented drivers, collecting more than 30 in a single two-hour sweep at one location. In a follow-up post, Fuller warned shippers directly: if your driver is arrested, your cargo will be stranded at an unknown location, unsecured, and likely unrecoverable. The freight industry reacted as if this were breaking news. It isn’t. At TruckSafe Consulting , we’ve been sounding this alarm for years, not because we predicted the exact moment ICE would roll sprinter vans into a Pilot, but because the legal infrastructure for such enforcement has existed for decades and has been expanding at an unprecedented rate. It’s called the 287(g) program, and if you don’t know what it is, you are already behind. The 287(g) Program and Why This Was Always Coming Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to deputize state and local law enforcement officers to perform the functions of federal immigration agents. This is not a new program. The first agreement was signed in 2002 with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. What is new is the scale. As of February 18, 2026, ICE has signed 1,427 Memorandums of Agreement for 287(g) programs covering 40 states. To put that number in perspective: during Trump’s first term in 2019, only 45 of these agreements were signed. Over 1,130 were signed in 2025 alone. The program has gone from a niche enforcement tool to a nationwide apparatus. There are three operational models under 287(g), and the one that should concern every motor carrier in America is the Task Force Model: Task Force Model (TFM), 809 agencies: This is the one that matters most for trucking. Under the TFM, deputized officers can stop, question, and make arrests for immigration violations during their routine policing duties. That means the state trooper who pulls your driver over for a pre-trip inspection deficiency, the officer working a weigh station, or the local deputy responding to a fender bender in a truck stop parking lot, if they operate under a 287(g) TFM agreement, they have the authority to act as immigration enforcement on the spot. Warrant Service Officer Model (WSO), 465 agencies: Trains and authorizes officers to serve and execute administrative immigration warrants within jails and correctional facilities. Jail Enforcement Model (JEM), 152 agencies: Allows officers to screen individuals booked into local jails for immigration status and issue detainers to hold them for ICE. Story Continues Add those together: 1,427 agencies across 40 states now have some form of deputized immigration enforcement authority. DHS is actively recruiting more staff through a new reimbursement program that covers salary and benefits for participating agencies. This is not slowing down. It is accelerating. What This Means for Trucking It is no longer just ICE agents at truck stops who can take your driver off the road. Under the Task Force Model, any deputized local or state officer encountered during a routine traffic stop, a roadside inspection, a weigh station check, or a crash response can initiate immigration enforcement action. Your driver doesn’t have to be at a truck stop. Your driver doesn’t have to be targeted in a sweep. Your driver just has to be pulled over for a burned-out marker light in one of the 809 jurisdictions operating under a TFM agreement, and the officer has the authority to question immigration status and make an arrest. This is why we at TruckSafe have long advocated that carriers must properly screen and qualify their drivers from both compliance and risk perspectives. The 287(g) infrastructure didn’t appear overnight. We watched it grow. We warned our clients. And now the freight industry at large is waking up to a reality we’ve been preparing for all along. Compliant Is Not Defensible Meeting the minimum regulatory requirements for driver qualification does not make you defensible. It makes you compliant. Those are two very different things. Compliant means you checked the boxes required under 49 CFR Part 391. You pulled an MVR. You got a medical card. You ran a pre-employment drug test. You have a driver qualification file. Defensible means that when a plaintiff’s attorney deposes your safety director after a catastrophic crash, or when ICE arrests your driver, and your shipper’s $200,000 load of pharmaceuticals is sitting unattended at a Love’s in Midland, Texas, you can demonstrate that your hiring process was thorough, objective, consistently applied, and designed to identify risk before it materialized. The carrier that simply meets the minimum standard is the carrier that gets destroyed in litigation. The carrier that builds a defensible screening program is the one that survives. The Real-World Consequences Are Already Here We work with some of the largest Fortune 500 companies in the world. We recently worked with a client whose non-domiciled CDL driver was pulled over at a weigh station in Texas and arrested. The load was stranded. The shipper was furious. The insurance company started asking questions. The carrier was left scrambling to explain how this driver ended up behind the wheel of its truck in the first place. This pattern will accelerate not only because of ICE sweeps at truck stops, but also because the 809 Task Force Model agencies can now initiate immigration enforcement during any routine encounter with a CMV driver within their jurisdiction. The consequences extend far beyond the immediate disruption: Cargo claims. The shipper files a claim for the full value of the stranded, potentially spoiled, or stolen freight. Your cargo insurance may or may not cover a load abandoned due to a driver’s arrest. Authority risk. Repeated incidents of this nature attract the attention of the FMCSA. Compliance reviews follow. Conditional ratings follow. Authority revocation follows. Insurance exposure. Your insurer will audit your hiring practices. If they find gaps, and they will find gaps, expect non-renewal, premium increases, or policy rescission. Litigation exposure. If that driver was involved in a crash before or after the arrest, the plaintiff’s attorney will use your inadequate screening as evidence of negligent hiring. Nuclear verdicts start here. Broker and shipper fallout. Freight brokers are already starting to vet carriers more aggressively. Shippers will demand proof of defensible hiring practices as a condition of doing business. What a Defensible Driver Screening Program Looks Like Here is what we build for our clients at TruckSafe. This is not a suggestion list. This is the standard. Each of these steps should be completed before a driver is dispatched on their first load. 1. Complete and Signed Driver Application (49 CFR §391.21) The application must be complete, signed, dated, and include all driver-specific disclosures required by regulation. Gaps in employment history must be investigated and documented. A half-completed application is not a minor oversight; it is the first red flag a plaintiff’s attorney will wave in front of a jury. 2. Motor Vehicle Record (MVR) Review (49 CFR §391.23) Pull MVRs from every state where the driver has held a license in the past three years. Review for license class, endorsements, restrictions, suspensions, moving violations, DUIs, and accident history. This review must be conducted by a designated reviewer and signed off under 49 CFR §391.27. Do not accept the driver’s word for their driving history. Verify everything. 3. FMCSA Pre-Employment Screening Program (PSP) Report The PSP report gives you federally reported crash and inspection data. Review crash history, inspection history, and out-of-service events.

Casey Bond · Lead Editor and Content Strategist, Banking Thu, February 19, 2026 at 4:00 AM MST 4 min read If you’re looking to supercharge your savings, a high-yield savings account could provide an above-average return to help your balance grow faster. However, not all banks offer high savings account rates, which is why it’s important to shop around and find the most competitive savings interest rates available. Read on to learn more about where to find the best savings interest rates today. Banks with the best savings interest rates today Savings account rates have been trending down since 2024, when the Federal Reserve began cutting the federal funds rate. The good news is that many high-yield savings accounts still offer rates of around 4% APY and up. The best rates are typically offered by online banks, although you may be able to find comparable savings interest rates at some credit unions and community banks. As of February 19, 2026, the highest savings account rate available from our partners is 4% APY. This rate is offered by SoFi*, Barclays, and Valley Direct. Here is a look at some of the best savings interest rates available today from our verified partners: How do I choose the best savings account? Selecting a savings account with a competitive interest rate is important. The higher the rate, the faster your balance will grow over time. That said, the interest rate shouldn't be your only point of comparison. Other factors, such as fees, ATM locations, the bank's reputation, and more should also be considered. The best savings accounts offer a combination of high rates, low fees, accessibility, and an overall positive banking experience. Not sure where to start? Check out our ranking of the 10 best high-yield savings accounts available today. Savings account interest rate forecast Following several years of near-zero interest rates, the Federal Reserve began raising the the federal funds rate in 2022 in order to combat rapidly rising inflation. As a result, savings interest rates skyrocketed, reaching a 15-year high. However, in late 2024, the Fed implemented a series of cuts to the federal funds rate, and savings account rates started dropping. At the end of 2025, the Fed cut rates for a third time, with additional rate cuts expected in the coming months. It’s difficult to predict exactly how and when interest rates will change going forward, but one thing is for sure: Today’s high savings account rates won’t last forever. So, if you’re hoping to give your savings a boost and take advantage of the best rates on the market, there’s no better time than now. How to open a savings account The requirements involved in opening a savings account vary by financial institution. However, if you’re ready to open an account, you can follow these general steps: Research savings account rates: Of course, when choosing a savings account, one of the most important factors to evaluate are the interest rates. Be sure that you select a savings account with a competitive rate to help your money grow. Figure out your must-haves: Although savings account interest rates should be top of mind, that’s not the only factor to consider. You’ll also want to think about what else you need from your account, whether it’s no minimum balance requirement , low fees, or other perks. Finding a savings account with a solid rate that also helps you achieve your goals is key. Prepare documentation: Opening a bank account requires you to provide a few important personal details and documents. Before you start your application, be sure you have your Social Security number, driver’s license or passport number, and proof of address. Fill out the application: In many cases, you can apply for savings account online. However, some financial institutions may require you to visit the branch in person to apply. Either way, the application for a new savings account should only take a few minutes to complete. In many cases, you’ll get your approval decision instantly. Fund your account: Once your savings account application is approved, you’ll need to add funds to the account. Be sure you’re aware of any minimum opening deposit requirements and timeline for funding.

Casey Bond · Lead Editor and Content Strategist, Banking Thu, February 19, 2026 at 4:00 AM MST 3 min read Find out which banks are offering the best CD rates right now. If you’re looking for a secure place to store your savings, a certificate of deposit (CD) may be a great choice. These accounts often provide higher interest rates than traditional checking and savings accounts. However, CD rates can vary widely. Learn more about where CD rates stand today and how to find the best rates available. Banks with the best CD rates today CD rates are relatively high compared to historical averages. That said, CD rates have been on the decline since last year when the Federal Reserve began cutting its target rate. The good news is that several financial institutions offer competitive rates of 4% APY and up, particularly online banks. Today, the highest CD rate is 4% APY. This rate is offered by Marcus by Goldman Sachs on its 1-year CD. Here is a look at some of the best CD rates available today from our verified partners: CD rate predictions for 2026 The Federal Reserve began decreasing the federal funds rate in light of slowing inflation and an overall improved economic outlook. It cut its target rate three times in late 2024 by a total of one percentage point. In December, the Fed announced its third rate cut of 2025 and additional cuts could be on the horizon in 2026. However, it's uncertain when that will happen and how many cuts the Fed plans to make. The federal funds rate doesn’t directly impact deposit interest rates, though they are correlated. When the Fed lowers rates, financial institutions typically follow suit (and vice versa). So now that the Fed has lowered its rate, CD rates are beginning to fall again. That’s why now may be a good time to put your money in a CD and lock in today’s best rates. How to open a CD The process for opening a CD account varies by financial institution. However, there are a few general steps you can expect to follow: Research CD rates: One of the most important factors to consider when opening a CD is whether the account provides a competitive rate. You can easily compare CD rates online to find the best offers. Choose an account that meets your needs: While a CD’s interest rate is a key consideration, it shouldn’t be the only one. You should also evaluate the CD’s term length, minimum opening deposit requirements, and fees to ensure a particular account fits your financial needs and goals. For example, you want to avoid choosing a CD term that’s too long, otherwise you’ll be subject to an early withdrawal penalty if you need to pull out your funds before the CD matures. Get your documents ready: When opening a bank account, you will need to provide a few pieces of information, including your Social Security number, address, and driver’s license or passport number. Having these documents on hand will help streamline the application process. Complete the application: These days, many financial institutions allow you to apply for an account online, though you might have to visit the branch in some cases. Either way, the application for a new CD should only take a few minutes to complete. And in many cases, you’ll get your approval decision instantly. Fund the account: Once your CD application is approved, it’s time to fund the account. This can usually be done by transferring money from another account or mailing a check.

      "content": "Oil companies jostle for projects to boost Venezuelan output quickly; a real grind awaits Oil platforms and pumpjacks at Lake Maracaibo in Cabimas, Venezuela, January 26, 2026. REUTERS/Leonardo Fernandez Viloria · Reuters By Mariela Nava , Marianna Parraga and Ana Isabel Martinez Thu, February 19, 2026 at 4:06 AM MST 10 min read CL=F By Mariela Nava , Marianna Parraga and Ana Isabel Martinez CABIMAS, Venezuela, Feb 19 (Reuters) - In September, a rig used to drill wells in shallow waters completed the long trip from China to Venezuela's oil-producing region of Lake Maracaibo. The passage of the big old rig named Alula just inches below the bridge connecting Maracaibo city with the oilfields of the lake's eastern coast stirred excitement among residents and workers: they had not seen any new drilling equipment arrive for years due to U.S. sanctions. The rig hit an oil pipeline as it passed through the lake and over the metallic spaghetti of 20,000 kilometers of pipes beneath the waters. Crude leaked for months before repairs could be made and the rig installed at the polluted lake late last year. The crude production increase has been small ‌since then. The story of the Alula is a cautionary tale for the foreign energy companies such as U.S. oil major Chevron that are looking to quickly expand in Venezuela and take on the short-term projects needed to boost the country's oil output. Each step forward often brings a new host of challenges. Other foreign companies with a toehold in the country include Spain's Repsol, Italy's ENI, France's Maurel&Prom and China National Petroleum Corp. U.S. ‌President Donald Trump wants American companies to spend $100 billion to rebuild an oil industry that has suffered 20 years of neglect, mismanagement and underinvestment under the socialist presidents Hugo Chavez and Nicolas Maduro. Washington has been easing sanctions since its military incursion to snatch Maduro in early January by issuing a handful of general licenses that allow energy companies to export, import, invest and operate oil and gas projects in the OPEC member. Early expansions could lead to the South American country adding as much as 500,000 barrels a day (bpd) of crude output in as little as six months from a current ​1 million bpd, two executives from companies with assets there said. U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said this month from Caracas he expects a \"dramatic increase\" in Venezuela's production in the coming months. The U.S. oil capital of Houston and Venezuela's oil regions, meanwhile, are abuzz, mobilizing for an oil rush and for the business opportunities on offer to participate in one of the biggest repair jobs the energy industry has ever seen. It is an effort on the scale of work to boost Iraq's production after the second Gulf War or to rehabilitate the Kuwaiti oilfields torched by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Story Continues According to half a dozen industry workers, oil employees with experience in Venezuela and executives planning to work there, and numerous industry experts and analysts interviewed by Reuters for this story, the first phase in Venezuela would involve some relatively straightforward projects to get more oil flowing quickly: using rigs already in the country, refurbishing dilapidated wells and crude upgraders that are working below capacity, and repairing ports and pipelines operated by state oil company PDVSA. But even the easy projects are tough, they said, and after that, the work will get even harder. In early February, a Reuters reporter who toured the Lake Maracaibo area saw oil industry junk, tanks overflowing with crude, abandoned oilfields, blackened shorelines, and long lines of vehicles to buy gasoline close to storage terminals and operational sites run by PDVSA. They were all visible reminders of how much work lies ahead, even to pick what might be regarded as the low-hanging fruit, in the region that is home ‌to Venezuela's oldest production facilities and has the country's second-largest output capacity. THE FIRST STEPS Among the first steps companies foresee would be to execute projects like the one planned ⁠by China Concord Resources Corp, which brought the Alula rig to Venezuela last year. The firm aims to increase a combination of light and heavy oil production from two fields to 60,000 bpd by the end of this year from 16,000 bpd in December through a $1 billion program that would require refurbishing as many as 875 inactive wells before new wells can be drilled. The company is now fixing many unplanned issues, from insufficient supply of the gas needed to maintain pressure at wells, to the loss of key technical data and lack of transportation for workers, a source from the project said, adding that those obstacles have prevented it from reaching output targets. It is unclear if that project will proceed after Trump said companies from U.S. rivals ⁠on the global political stage - China, Russia and Iran - were no longer welcome in Venezuela. Under sanctions, companies from those countries were among the few that were willing to work there. In contrast, Chevron - for years the only U.S. major producing crude in the country - is in prime position to achieve early gains. The company needs the type of light crude that China Concord is pumping and is competing with rivals to secure supplies in Lake Maracaibo. Light oil and fuel that can dilute Venezuela's tar-like oil are precious commodities for energy companies working in Venezuela. Without expensive crude upgraders or diluents, the country's massive reserves of extra heavy crude cannot be transported or exported. The promise of relatively easy to produce barrels is increasing the appetite of foreign oil companies for work in highly polluted or technically complex regions like Lake Maracaibo and Monagas North, which state company PDVSA has neglected in recent decades as part of its strategy to keep the focus on the prolific and heavy-oil rich Orinoco Belt further southeast. Oil from around Maracaibo could also be cheaper for Chevron to produce than from other ​regions in Venezuela, ​especially as crude prices remain low, because it does not need to be treated before export, said a former employee who worked on the Venezuela operations. Other options include reopening existing wells shut down due to lack of specialized equipment or power supply, reconditioning low-performing wells to ​increase output, and drilling new wells, the former employee said, adding that Chevron would likely have a long list of new well locations under consideration. Chevron said it \"has been a part ‌of Venezuela's past and remains committed to working in partnership for its future,\" adding that it welcomes recent U.S. licenses and legal reforms in Venezuela. The country's oil ministry and PDVSA did not reply to requests for comment. China Concord could not be immediately reached for comment. HEAVIER ORINOCO CRUDE Companies with oil contracts and project stakes across the country are jostling for access to specialized equipment already there. There are up to 14 drilling rigs that have been in storage for years in Venezuela and are owned by Houston-headquartered SLB, one of the top global oil service providers, three sources with knowledge of its assets said. SLB has been the main service provider to Chevron since it began its most recent drilling program in Venezuela in 2024 as part of a previous U.S. broad license. Like the U.S. major, SLB has many years of experience in the country. The rigs that SLB has in Venezuela were deployed for PDVSA projects before the U.S. imposed sanctions in 2019. After that, U.S. companies and those abiding by U.S. sanctions could not operate rigs or specialized equipment there. SLB said it continues to have operational facilities, equipment and staff in Venezuela, and is in \"the early stages of collaboration\" with customers on next steps. \"We are confident that under the right conditions and safety environment, we can ramp up activities ",

Trey Thoelcke Thu, February 19, 2026 at 8:45 AM EST 4 min read WFC C C-PR Quick Read Wells Fargo (WFC) fell 5% since January 1 while Citigroup (C) barely slipped after their January 14 earnings. Wells Fargo’s Federal Reserve asset cap removal enables unrestricted deposit and loan growth. Wells Fargo raised equity return targets to 17-18%. Citigroup’s net income fell 13.8% to $2.5B as operating expenses rose 6% from compensation and technology costs. A recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here . Wells Fargo ( NYSE: WFC ) and Citigroup ( NYSE: C ) both reported Q4 2025 earnings on January 14, 2026, yet investors sold off both stocks despite solid results. The selloff reflects concern over net interest income pressure in a higher-for-longer rate environment. Since January 1, 2026, Wells Fargo has declined 4.98% while Citigroup has slipped just 0.36%, revealing how different business models respond to the same rate backdrop. How the Quarter Landed: Asset Cap Removal vs. Cost Restructuring Wells Fargo delivered $21.29 billion in revenue and $1.76 EPS, topping earnings expectations but falling short on the top line. Its Consumer, Small & Business Banking segment rose 9% to $6.59 billion, while Credit Card climbed 7% to $1.38 billion. CEO Charlie Scharf called the removal of the Federal Reserve asset cap transformational: \"Strong financial performance, removal of the asset cap [...] and stronger growth in both our consumer and commercial businesses make me proud of our 2025 results.\" Net interest income grew 4% year-over-year on higher loan balances and fixed-rate asset repricing. Citigroup posted $19.90 billion in revenue and $1.19 EPS, missing both estimates. Net income fell 13.8% to $2.5 billion, weighed down by 6% higher operating expenses tied to compensation, legal, and technology costs. Banking revenues surged 78% and Services rose 15%, but Markets slipped 1%. CEO Jane Fraser's restructuring included 1,000 job cuts in January 2026. The bank's presence in 180+ countries provides diversification but also exposes it to geopolitical volatility. One Bet on Domestic Growth, One on Global Reach With the asset cap lifted, Wells Fargo can grow deposits and loans without regulatory constraint. Management raised its medium-term return on tangible common equity target to 17% to 18% from 15%, expects mid-single-digit loan and deposit growth in 2026, and anticipates two more Fed rate cuts. The 10Y-2Y yield curve spread at 0.64% supports net interest margin expansion, though further cuts could compress that advantage. Story Continues Citigroup leans into institutional banking, cross-border services, and wealth management. Its $208 billion market cap reflects a lower valuation than Wells Fargo's $278 billion, with Citi trading at 1.06x book value versus Wells Fargo's 1.64x. Fraser's turnaround targets a lower expense base while protecting Services and Banking revenue, though Russia-related tax impacts continue to surface. Metric Wells Fargo Citigroup Dividend Yield 1.95% 2.06% Q4 Buybacks + Dividends $6.4B $5.6B Price-to-Book 1.64x 1.06x Why Wells Fargo Edges Ahead for Income Wells Fargo increased its quarterly dividend 13% over 2025 to $0.45 and repurchased $5.0 billion in stock during Q4 alone. Citigroup's 2.06% yield is slightly higher, but declining net income and rising expenses cloud the picture. Wells Fargo's domestic focus also insulates it from geopolitical risk. For those drawn to a turnaround play, Citi's discount to book value offers appeal, though the restructuring timeline remains uncertain. Trump's proposed credit card interest rate cap poses a shared risk, though Wells Fargo's diversified consumer banking portfolio may absorb it better than Citi's card-heavy U.S. personal banking segment. Data Shows One Habit Doubles American’s Savings And Boosts Retirement Most Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t. And no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it’s shocking more people don’t adopt the habit given how easy it is . Terms and Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices More Info",

Headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, it coordinates global delivery and e-commerce activities. The company has a market capitalization of $88.24 billion. Based on strong analyst sentiment regarding FedEx’s strategic success, the company has the potential to capitalize on growing demand for logistics and delivery services. Over the past 52 weeks, the stock has gained 43.2%, and it is up 32.6% year-to-date (YTD).  FedEx’s shares reached a high of $383.59 on Feb. 18, and are only down marginally from that level.

The S&P 500 index ($SPX) is up 12.3% over the past 52 weeks and is up marginally YTD. Therefore, the stock has outperformed the broader market over these periods. Compared with FedEx’s own sector, we also observe outperformance. The State Street Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLI) has increased 26.3% over the past 52 weeks, while it has rallied 12.8% YTD. www.barchart.com For the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (quarter ended Nov. 30), FedEx’s revenue increased 7% year-over-year (YOY) to $23.47 billion, which is higher than the $22.86 billion that Wall Street analysts had expected. The topline growth is based on Federal Express segment revenue increasing 8% to $20.43 billion in the prior-year period, driven by higher U.S. domestic and International Priority package yields, ongoing cost reductions from transformation efforts, lower business optimization expenses, and rising U.S. domestic package volumes. FedEx’s adjusted EPS for the quarter was $4.82, up 19% YOY and higher than the expected $4.07 figure. For the current quarter, Street analysts expect FedEx’s profit to decrease 8.7% YOY to $4.12 per diluted share, while for the current fiscal year, it is expected to increase 1.6% to $18.48 per diluted share, followed by a 16.5% growth to $21.52 per diluted share in the following fiscal year. The company also has a solid history of surpassing consensus estimates, topping them in three of the four trailing quarters. Story Continues Among the 27 Wall Street analysts covering FedEx’s stock, the consensus is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on 17 “Strong Buy” ratings, two “Moderate Buys,” seven “Holds,” and one “Moderate Sell.” The ratings configuration has become more bullish than a month ago, with the number of “Strong Buy” ratings increasing from 15 to 17. www.barchart.com This month, TD Cowen analyst Jason H. Seidl reaffirmed a “Buy” rating for FedEx while raising the price target from $313 to $383, while Wells Fargo analyst Christian Wetherbee maintained an “Overweight” rating while raising the price target from $380 to $430. FedEx’s mean price target of $365.85 indicates a 4.5% downside over current market prices. However, the Street-high price target of $479 implies a potential upside of 25%.

U.S. utilities have invested heavily to upgrade electric grids as they face ‌extreme weather and growing demand from power-hungry data centers dedicated to AI and cryptocurrency, alongside a shift by homes and businesses toward electric ​heating and transport. More from Yahoo Scout What factors are driving higher electricity demand nationwide? Why did Southern Co increase its spending plan? What major tech companies contracted with Southern Co? How will Southern Co expand its power generation capacity? \"We're in the midst of a watershed moment for the energy industry and our nation,\" Southern Co CEO Chris Womack said on a call with investors. Southern Co expects to spend about $81 billion from 2026 through 2030, compared with its prior five-year plan of $76 billion, with about half of that spending going to boosting power generation. The Atlanta, Georgia-based utility ‌said it had contracted 10 gigawatts ⁠of large-load customers across Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi, including Google, Meta, Microsoft and Compass Datacenters. Its shares rose more than 4% in afternoon trade. Data centers with a combined demand of around ⁠75 gigawatts have expressed interest in connecting to Southern Co's system, executives said on an earnings call with investors. One gigawatt is enough to power about 750,000 homes. Among its plans to expand its power supplies, Southern Co said it could redirect to new ​customers about ​1,000 megawatts of natural gas-fired generation capacity by 2030. It ​is also in late-stage discussions to increase the ‌output of its existing natural gas fleet to create an additional 700 megawatts. \"Southern continues to capitalize on its growth opportunities in a prudent manner,\" Evercore ISI analyst Nicholas Amicucci said. The utility's capital spending and earnings outlook should drive shares higher, while still maintaining upside potential as its service territory in the Southeast U.S. \"continues to see strong demand from large loads seeking grid connection given the region's favorable regulatory environment and affordability,\" he said. Southern Co is the ‌second-largest U.S. utility, with 9 million customers across Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, ​Mississippi, Tennessee and Virginia. In addition to data center demand, extreme weather ​and growing populations in the U.S. South are ​driving up power use. A winter storm in January caused the second-highest winter peak electric load ‌on Southern Co's system, it said. Also on Thursday, ​Southern Co forecast adjusted annual ​profit below analysts' estimates. Story Continues For the quarter ended December 31, Southern Co posted an adjusted profit of 55 cents per share, below analysts' expectations of 57 cents, according to data compiled by LSEG. Its operating expenses jumped ​14.7% during the quarter, while revenue ‌rose 10%. The company expects adjusted profit for 2026 to be between $4.50 and $4.60 per share, with the midpoint ​slightly below the estimate of $4.56 per share.

REUTERS/Chris Helgren · Reuters By Promit Mukherjee Thu, February 19, 2026 at 8:33 AM EST 2 min read By Promit Mukherjee OTTAWA, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Canada's international merchandise trade deficit narrowed in December as exports grew faster than imports, and its share of exports to ‌the United Sates dropped to its lowest level on record barring the COVID-19 ‌months, data showed on Thursday. Statistics Canada said the country posted a C$1.31 billion ($957 million) deficit in December led ​by metals and non-metallic mineral exports. This was in contrast to a revised C$2.59 billion deficit in November. More from Yahoo Scout Why is Canada's trade dependency on US declining? How did non-US trade relationships perform in December? What drove the surge in metals exports? Why did Canada's trade deficit narrow in December? Economists had expected around C$2 billion deficit for December. Total exports rose 2.6% to C$65.63 billion, driven primarily by metals and non-metallic mineral products shipments that grew by 18% in December. ‌Exports of unwrought gold took ⁠the lead in this category with a jump of over 37%, helped by higher prices. However, excluding the metals and non-metallic category, the Canadian exports ⁠edged down 0.2%. In volume terms, total exports were up 1.4%, the statistics agency said. Imports increased 0.6% to C$66.93 billion, with six out of 11 product sections registering a rise. The increase ​was driven ​by imports of gold, passenger vehicles and energy ​products. TRADE WITH THE U.S. Exports to the ‌United States, Canada's largest trading partner, rose 1.1%, accounting for just over 67.4% of total exports, compared with 76.2% a year ago. This was the first time in three months that outbound shipments to the south increased in percentage terms, but the share of exports to the U.S. shrunk to its lowest level in since data collection began, except two months ‌of pandemic in 2020. The share of exports to the ​U.S. was 68.4% in November and 67.5% in October. Imports ​from the U.S., however, rose faster ​by 3.5%, narrowing Canada's merchandise trade surplus with its southern neighbor ‌to C$5.7 billion, from C$6.5 billion in ​November. Meanwhile, exports to countries ​other than the U.S. continued their upward momentum, reaching an all-time high in December. Exports of gold to the United Kingdom led most of the gains. Imports from countries ​other than the United States ‌fell 3% in December and Canada's trade deficit with countries other than the ​United States narrowed to $7 billion in December from $9 billion in November, StatsCan ​said.

Q4 2025 Earnings Call Summary - Moby Performance Attribution and Strategic Context Record revenue of $1.05 billion in 2025 was driven by strategic acquisitions and a record aftermarket parts business, which reached 71% of total revenue. Management attributed the outperformance of aftermarket parts to customers running aging equipment harder to compensate for offline capacity and deferred capital investment. Industrial Processing segment growth was bolstered by the successful integration of Clyde Industries and Babbini, despite relatively soft capital project activity throughout the year. Flow Control performance saw North American strength offset by European weakness, with margins impacted by tariff volatility and product mix shifts. Material Handling delivered solid year-over-year improvements in bookings and margins, supported by modernization efforts in recycling and infrastructure construction. The company achieved record free cash flow of $154 million, allowing for the repayment of approximately 42% of outstanding debt held at the end of 2024. 2026 Outlook and Strategic Assumptions Management adopted a conservative 2026 guidance framework, assuming 1% to 3% organic growth and excluding potential upside from large pending capital projects. The first quarter of 2026 is expected to be the weakest period due to soft capital bookings in the latter half of 2025 and the timing of capital shipments. Capital project activity is projected to strengthen as customers gain economic clarity and address the long-term necessity of productivity-enhancing investments. Guidance excludes the pending acquisition of voestalpine BÖHLER Profil GmbH, which is expected to close in Q1 2026 and will trigger a guidance revision. The company is shifting its reporting methodology to add back recurring intangible amortization to adjusted EPS to better align with cash flow and peer comparisons. Risk Factors and Structural Dynamics Tariff volatility and magnitude were cited as significant challenges in 2025, causing customers to adopt a 'wait-and-see' attitude toward capital expenditures. Geopolitical and macroeconomic instability continue to influence the timing of capital orders, particularly in European and Asian manufacturing sectors. The company anticipates its leverage ratio will increase to just above 2 following the completion of the voestalpine BÖHLER Profil acquisition. Global minimum tax regulations and changes in the geographic distribution of earnings contributed to a higher-than-anticipated tax rate in Q4 2025. Q&A Session Highlights Our analysts just identified a stock with the potential to be the next Nvidia. Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Story Continues Capital project timing and customer sentiment regarding tariffs Management noted that while projects haven't been canceled, customers have delayed commitments due to the chaotic nature of tariff implementations. Customers are now shifting focus toward improving productivity and squeezing efficiency from existing operations rather than adding new capacity. Competitive dynamics in the aftermarket parts sector European and regional competitors are attempting to gain market share through aggressive pricing, but Kadant relies on high technical service levels and 'sticky' relationships to defend its position. Management emphasized that total cost of ownership and technical support are more critical to customers than initial price undercutting. Growth drivers in the Material Handling segment Data center construction is a significant driver, requiring massive amounts of processed natural resources like aggregate, sand, copper, and aluminum. Kadant's equipment is integral to the mining and processing of these materials, benefiting from the current boom in large-scale infrastructure projects. One stock.

Performance was driven by a 'connected portfolio' strategy, allowing the company to capture higher share of wallet by supplying integrated materials and services across the value chain. Strategic alignment with three core megatrends—transportation, water, and reindustrialization—provided a robust demand backdrop despite headwinds in residential sectors. Aggressive capital allocation saw $4.1 billion invested in 38 acquisitions, focusing on high-growth platforms like aggregates, cementitious materials, roads, and water. The 'CRH Winning Way' operational framework enabled the company to maintain pricing momentum and cost discipline, offsetting inflationary pressures in labor and raw materials. Scale serves as a primary differentiator, with 85% of U.S. data centers located within 25 miles of a CRH facility, facilitating rapid response to reindustrialization needs. 2026 Outlook and Strategic Targets 2026 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $8.1 billion to $8.5 billion assumes normal seasonal weather and no major macroeconomic dislocations. Growth assumptions rely on the continued rollout of the IIJA, with approximately 50% of federal highway funds still to be deployed. Management expects $200 million in net incremental EBITDA from 2025 acquisitions, though this will be partially offset by the planned divestment of the Construction Accessories business. Medium-term targets through 2030 include average annual revenue growth of 7% to 9% and an adjusted EBITDA margin target of 22% to 24%. Financial capacity for the next five years is estimated at $40 billion, with 70% intended for growth-oriented M&A and CapEx. Strategic Investments and Portfolio Shifts Integration of Eco Material is progressing ahead of schedule, with early wins in commercial and logistical synergies within the cementitious platform. The planned divestment of the Construction Accessories business is expected to close later in 2026 as part of ongoing portfolio optimization. Invested $1.7 billion in growth CapEx, including a $100 million precast pipe plant in Texas to capitalize on accelerating water infrastructure demand. Shareholder returns remain a priority, with a new $300 million quarterly share buyback tranche commenced and a 5% increase in the quarterly dividend. Q&A Session Insights Our analysts just identified a stock with the potential to be the next Nvidia. Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Story Continues Underlying assumptions for 2026 volume and pricing guidance U.S. aggregates volumes are expected to grow in the low single digits supported by mid-single-digit pricing momentum, while cement is expected to see low single-digit growth in both volumes and pricing. International cement pricing is projected to rise in the low to mid-single digits, marking the ninth consecutive year of increases in European cement. Guidance assumes no recovery in the U.S. residential new-build market, which remains subdued due to affordability challenges. Impact of potential highway bill delays or extensions Management expressed confidence in bipartisan support for a multi-year reauthorization, noting that 2026 DOT budgets are already up 6%. If a 1-year extension occurs instead of a new bill, funding would likely shift toward repair and maintenance (R&M) activities, which management described as a 'sweet spot' for CRH. Synergy realization and M&A pipeline sustainability The 'connected' nature of the portfolio allows CRH to identify synergies that other bidders cannot, often acting as the 'acquirer of choice' due to long-standing local relationships. Synergies in the Australia Adbri acquisition are being delivered earlier and at higher levels than originally anticipated.

Performance was bolstered by the successful refinancing of $1.2 billion in floating rate debt into fixed rate debt, yielding over $8 million in annual cash savings. Management attributes the 113% year-over-year growth in Normalized FFO to strong operational execution and the realization of mark-to-market rent increases. The portfolio remains highly stable with 76% of revenues derived from investment-grade tenants or secure Hawaii land leases, supporting a 94.5% occupancy rate. Strategic focus on deleveraging resulted in a reduction of the net debt leverage ratio from 12.4x to 11.8x over the past year. Deepened relationships with anchor tenants FedEx and Amazon, who together accounted for 38% of the year's total leasing volume. The Hawaii footprint continues to provide a unique competitive advantage for the portfolio, while company-wide same-property cash basis NOI increased year-over-year driven by strong tenant retention and rent roll-ups. 2026 Outlook and Strategic Priorities Management expects continued organic cash flow growth as 55% of 2025 leasing activity has not yet commenced and will contribute in 2026 and beyond. Leasing priorities for 2026 are centered on a 2.2 million square foot land parcel in Hawaii and a 535,000 square foot property in Indianapolis. The company anticipates average rent roll-ups of approximately 20% on the Mainland and 30% in Hawaii based on current pipeline negotiations. Guidance for Q1 2026 assumes interest expense of $61.5 million, with Normalized FFO projected between $0.29 and $0.31 per share. Management plans to exercise the extension option for the $1.4 billion floating rate loan in the consolidated joint venture, extending maturity to March 2027. Financial Adjustments and Risk Factors Incurred a $5.7 million incentive fee payment to the manager in January 2026 due to outperforming the industry benchmark by over 60% over three years. Recognized a $1.4 million net loss from the opportunistic sale of two vacant unencumbered properties totaling 286,000 square feet. A planned $50 million property sale was canceled after the tenant opted to sign a 7-year lease renewal instead of purchasing the asset. The company expects to spend approximately $4 million to purchase a required interest rate cap as part of the joint venture loan extension. Analyst Q&A Highlights Status of significant vacancies in Indianapolis and Hawaii Our analysts just identified a stock with the potential to be the next Nvidia. Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Story Continues Management is currently exchanging lease comments for the Indianapolis space, with a potential lease-up as early as next quarter. The Hawaii parcel remains in discussions with a long-term prospect; delays are attributed to the site's complexity and large scale as a ground lease. Sustainability of same-store NOI growth trends Growth is considered sustainable because many leases are signed 12-18 months in advance, meaning the cash impact of recent high-spread renewals will hit in late 2026 and 2027. Refinancing strategy for the $1.4 billion joint venture loan The company is actively evaluating the macro environment but feels no pressure to rush due to the extension option which carries no extra fees beyond the interest rate cap. The underlying JV portfolio is 100% leased, meaning no operational improvements are required to prepare for a future refinancing. Impact of new supply and market competition on the Mainland Management has not seen new supply as a major issue because construction has slowed and tenants find relocation disruptive and costly. Several tenants who explored relocation options ultimately returned to negotiate renewals for their existing spaces. One stock. Nvidia-level potential. 30M+ investors trust Moby to find it first.

So if you have $3,000 to add to your portfolio now, I'd suggest sticking to growth stocks that are market leaders that have strong moats and that are trading at reasonable valuations. In particular, you could split that investment between these three unstoppable AI stocks and hold onto them for the long term. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks » Nvidia Spending on AI infrastructure continues to soar, as five of the largest hyperscalers (owners of giant data centers) have committed to spending a total of $700 billion this year alone to expand their cloud capacity. To put that in perspective, only 24 countries in the world had gross domestic products higher than that in 2025. One of the biggest beneficiaries of this spending will be Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) . The company has about a 90% share of the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, as its chips are the main processors used to power AI workloads. It has created a wide moat in this arena both through its cutting-edge chip designs and its CUDA software platform, which is where most foundational AI code was written. Meanwhile, it has a strong and growing network platform that enables it to deliver end-to-end AI server solutions. Despite Nvidia's strong continued growth, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just over 23.5, making it a great stock to buy and hold for the long term. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has the most complete AI stack, with both a leading large language model in Gemini and its own world-class custom AI chips in its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Designing some of its own AI chips gives Alphabet a structural cost advantage, allowing it to train and run its AI models more cheaply than competitors. Meanwhile, it is now just starting to let customers lease its TPUs at scale within its cloud computing business, opening up another revenue stream. Anthropic has placed a large TPU order with Alphabet's chip partner Broadcom , while Google will also become Apple 's preferred cloud computing provider. Alphabet remains the dominant player in search. Because it owns both the market-leading browser (Chrome) and smartphone operating system (Android), and also has a revenue-sharing deal with Apple that makes Google the default search engine on its devices, Google has maintained its position as the de facto gateway to the internet for most people. At the same time, it has embedded Gemini throughout its solutions, including Google Search. Its AI Overviews and AI Mode options are contributing to an increase in search queries, which in turn is helping its search revenue growth accelerate. Story Continues Trading at a forward P/E of 26.5, Alphabet is another reasonably priced stock to buy and hold for the long haul. Image source: Getty Images. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is the leading chip manufacturer in the world, and as its competitors have struggled to achieve high enough yields of functional cutting-edge silicon, it has become a virtual monopoly when it comes to making advanced chips like GPUs and TPUs. The company's moat derives from both its technological expertise and its scale, which are unmatched in the industry. With the market for AI infrastructure booming, TSMC is working closely with chip designers to increase manufacturing capacity, and has greatly ramped up its own spending to build new fabs. At the same time, given its integral position in the semiconductor value chain, TSMC has been enjoying strong pricing power. In fact, according to reports, it has already informed customers of its planned schedule to raise prices over the next four years. Trading at a forward P/E of 25.5 times, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is another attractively valued growth stock to buy and hold. Between its growing production capacity and its ability to boost its prices, it has great long-term growth prospects. Should you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

Q4 2025 Earnings Call Summary - Moby Strategic Integration and Portfolio Optimization Management has doubled its annual run-rate synergy target to $1.5 billion over 30 months, citing significantly greater opportunities identified during the first 11 weeks of the IPG integration. The company is aggressively realigning its portfolio to focus on 'Connected Capabilities,' identifying $3.2 billion in annual revenue from non-strategic or underperforming operations for exit or sale. Performance attribution for the quarter was driven by strong results in Media and Experiential, while PR faced challenging year-over-year comparisons due to the prior year's U.S. national election cycle. Strategic positioning is now centered on a unified platform organization that integrates Acxiom's Real ID and Flywheel's Commerce Cloud into the next-generation Omni data solution. Operational improvements are being driven by a shift to a unified resourcing model, including accelerated outsourcing, offshoring, and the elimination of duplicative corporate functions. Management emphasizes a shift toward 'enterprise-level' partnerships, where Omnicom orchestrates the entire consumer journey from creative engagement to measurable commerce outcomes. 2026 Outlook and Synergy Framework The company expects to realize $900 million of the total $1.5 billion in synergies during 2026, primarily through labor cost reductions and real estate consolidation. Guidance for 2026 assumes a positive foreign exchange impact exceeding 2% and a stable effective tax rate of approximately 26%. Management plans to execute the remaining $1.7 billion of identified business exits and sales over the next 12 months to streamline the core portfolio. Capital allocation for 2026 includes a $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program, with an additional $500 million to $1 billion in repurchases planned for the remainder of the year. The 2026 financial framework anticipates a $210 million increase in net interest expense, driven by the assumption of IPG debt and refinancing costs for upcoming maturities. Non-Recurring Charges and Structural Risks Recorded $1.1 billion in severance and repositioning costs in Q4 related to the IPG acquisition and subsequent organizational restructuring. Recognized a $543 million loss on planned dispositions, reflecting the net realizable value of businesses identified for exit. The company is transitioning from majority to minority ownership in smaller markets representing $700 million in revenue to reduce compliance complexity while maintaining client service. Reported leverage ratios are currently distorted due to the inclusion of full IPG debt but only one month of IPG earnings; pro forma total leverage is estimated at 2.4x.

Organic growth expectations for the retained business in 2026 Management noted that excluding planned dispositions, Q4 organic growth would have been approximately 4%. Specific 2026 organic growth targets were deferred to the March 12 Investor Day, as the full interrogation of combined profit plans is still underway. Post-disposition, Media and related services (including Precision and Commerce) are expected to represent roughly mid-50% of total revenue. Client reception and competitive differentiation of the combined offering Management reported high enthusiasm from both employees and clients, particularly regarding the scale of resources available for AI and data investment. The integration of Acxiom's Real ID into the Omni platform is considered a key strategic advantage that has generated an overwhelming response from existing and potential clients ahead of its formal launch at the end of Q1. The company successfully closed the sale of IPG's Jack Morton business shortly after the quarter ended, demonstrating rapid execution of the disposal strategy. Impact of Generative AI on labor and client billing Management views AI as a tool to increase output and confidence levels (e.g., testing 50 creative concepts instead of 3) rather than just a headcount reduction mechanism. The company expects to evolve client negotiations toward performance-based goals and rewards as AI-driven efficiencies change traditional manual processes. Internal adoption is focused on 'agentic' capabilities that connect Omnicom's processes with client databases for faster, automated execution. One stock.

Substantially derisked the 5-year plan by reaching 76% of revenue completion targets for new leasing, exceeding the year-end goal of 70%. Successfully committed all 30 targeted anchor and big box replacements, which are expected to generate approximately $750 million in annual tenant sales and catalyze in-line leasing. Portfolio sales reached a company record high of $881 per square foot, with the Go-Forward portfolio performing even higher at $921 per square foot. Completed $1.3 billion of the $2 billion disposition target, focusing on simplifying the business and reducing leverage by a full turn. Management attributes performance to the strength of Class A retail centers and a 'bifurcated' consumer economy where luxury and high-quality branding continue to outperform. The acquisition of Crabtree Valley Mall serves as a blueprint for future value-add opportunities where the Macerich platform can drive rapid re-leasing and operational improvements. Outlook and Strategic Priorities for 2026-2028 Anticipates a growth inflection point in the second half of 2026, with the Signed-Not-Open (SNO) pipeline expected to contribute $30 million in 2026 and up to $50 million annually by 2028. Focusing 2026 efforts on completing the remaining 350 uncommitted new leases and managing rent commencement dates to ensure timely cash flow. Targets further leverage reduction to the low-to-mid 6x net debt to EBITDA range over the next couple of years through continued dispositions and organic growth. Plans to provide an updated Path-Forward 3.0 strategy in June 2026 and intends to resume formal earnings guidance starting in 2027. Future acquisition strategy will prioritize value-add, lease-up opportunities that are accretive to 2028 FFO targets, potentially utilizing capital partners or equity. Financial Adjustments and Risk Factors Reported a $16.1 million legal claim settlement income in Q4 2025 related to a former development project no longer being pursued. The 29th Street property loan ($76 million pro rata share) is currently in default following its maturity; management is in active discussions with the lender. Identified $200 million to $300 million in additional non-core assets for potential sale or give-back to lenders over the next year. Q4 FFO was partially offset by $8.4 million in corporate expenses due to annual incentive bonus payouts exceeding target levels. Story Continues Q&A Session Highlights Strategic rationale and funding for future acquisition opportunities Our analysts just identified a stock with the potential to be the next Nvidia. Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Management prefers value-add 'lease-up' deals like Crabtree over stabilized low-cap rate assets to ensure accretion to 2028 FFO targets. Funding preferences lead with equity issuance or capital partnerships, with property recycling as a secondary option. Timing and magnitude of the projected growth inflection Growth will be back-end weighted in 2026, with the most significant FFO contributions from the SNO pipeline arriving in 2027 and 2028. The Go-Forward portfolio is expected to achieve at least 3% NOI growth in 2026, trending toward a 5.2% CAGR through 2028. Impact of anchor replacements on mall traffic and leasing New concepts like DICK'S House of Sport are driving significant traffic increases (e.g., 18% of total mall traffic at Freehold) and stimulating demand for adjacent in-line spaces. Management noted that physical stores remain the most profitable channel for retailers, supporting high demand despite broader economic caution. Status of the $2 billion disposition program Remaining outparcel and land sales are weighted toward 2026 due to the time required for unencumbering assets from loan collateral and securing entitlements. Pricing for these assets remains stable, with recent sales occurring in the 7% to 8% cap rate range. One stock. Nvidia-level potential. 30M+ investors trust Moby to find it first. Get the pick.

      "content": "Teekay Tankers Ltd. Q4 2025 Earnings Call Summary Moby Intelligence Thu, February 19, 2026 at 8:30 AM EST 3 min read TNK Teekay Tankers Ltd. Q4 2025 Earnings Call Summary - Moby Strategic Performance and Market Dynamics Performance was driven by significant spot market exposure during a period where rates reached the second-highest fourth-quarter levels in 15 years. Management attributes market strength to the unwinding of OPEC+ supply cuts and rising production from the Americas, which increased seaborne oil trade volumes to near-record highs. Stricter sanctions on Russia, Iran, and Venezuela have created trading inefficiencies that benefit the compliant fleet by pushing volumes away from the 'dark fleet'. Operational outperformance was supported by 99.8% fleet availability and a strategic reduction in free cash flow breakeven levels to approximately $11,300 per day. The company is executing a 'drip-feed' fleet renewal strategy, selling older Suezmaxes and its only VLCC to capitalize on high asset values while acquiring more modern Aframaxes. Strategic positioning focuses on maintaining a debt-free balance sheet with $853 million in cash to allow for rapid opportunistic investments in a volatile environment. Outlook and Strategic Assumptions Global oil demand is projected to increase by 1.1 million barrels per day in 2026, with additional upside from Chinese strategic stockpiling estimated at 1 million barrels per day. The shift of Venezuelan oil to the compliant fleet is expected to create significant demand, with management noting that every 500,000 barrels per day shifted to the U.S. Gulf requires approximately 20 Aframaxes. While the tanker order book is at a 10-year high, management views this as essential replacement demand for a fleet that has reached its highest average age in over 30 years. Future fleet growth remains uncertain as it depends on the timing of vessel removals through scrapping or migration to the dark fleet versus new deliveries accelerating in 2027. Management assumes continued volatility and potential rate spikes driven by geopolitical security premiums, though the duration of such impacts depends on actual infrastructure disruption. Structural Changes and Risk Factors The company finalized the sale of its only VLCC for $84.5 million, marking a strategic exit from that specific asset class to focus on midsized tankers. Estimated gains of approximately $45 million from recent vessel sales are expected to be recognized across the first and second quarters of 2026. A U.S. naval blockade in Venezuela has effectively halted long-haul flows to China via the dark fleet, redirecting volumes to compliant tankers in the U.S. Gulf and Europe. The company successfully exited its investment in Ardmore, generating a gross return of over 14% as part of its capital allocation optimization. Story Continues Q&A Session Highlights Our analysts just identified a stock with the potential to be the next Nvidia. Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Capital allocation strategy and potential for large-scale M&A Management prefers a 'drip-feed' approach of buying 1-2 modern ships at a time rather than major M&A due to currently high relative asset values. The $853 million cash position is viewed as a 'high-class problem' that provides the flexibility to act quickly if market values dip or unique opportunities arise. Impact of Venezuelan and Canadian crude flow changes Venezuelan exports are shifting from long-haul dark fleet routes to China toward compliant midsized tankers serving the U.S. and Europe. The Trans Mountain Expansion (TMX) in Canada is expected to drive Aframax demand as barrels move directly to Asia, potentially replacing lost Venezuelan heavy sour crude. Special dividend expectations for the first quarter Management deflected specific timing or amounts for a special dividend, noting that such decisions are typically discussed at the March Board meeting. Historical patterns suggest any announcements regarding supplemental capital returns would coincide with the May earnings release. One stock.

Q4 2025 Earnings Call Summary - Moby Strategic Performance and Operational Context Performance was impacted by accelerated depreciation from reverting the Wynnewood renewable diesel unit to hydrocarbon processing and extended downtime at the Coffeyville fertilizer plant. Management is initiating a cultural shift toward commercial optimization to improve margin capture by responding faster to volatile market windows and feedstock opportunities. The reversion of the Wynnewood unit is expected to expand crude slate flexibility and allow for the repurposing of rail assets for better feedstock security. At Coffeyville, the company is aggressively ramping up WCS processing toward 20,000 barrels per day to capitalize on widening Canadian crude differentials. The Fertilizer segment faced a 3-week startup delay caused by a third-party air separation plant, though underlying nitrogen demand remains robust due to high corn acreage estimates. Management is adopting a more proactive stance toward M&A, seeking geographic diversity and scale through bilateral discussions rather than traditional auction processes. Outlook and Strategic Priorities Refining fundamentals are expected to remain constructive through 2027 as global capacity additions slow while refined product demand, particularly diesel, remains steady. New refined product pipelines under development are expected to reduce seasonal basis volatility in the Mid-Continent by providing outlets to the West Coast and Denver. The company aims to restore a 'sustainable' dividend that can be maintained through all market cycles, rather than a fluctuating payout. Growth capital spending for 2026 is projected at $75 million to $90 million, peaking due to the Wynnewood alkylation project and fertilizer debottlenecking. Management anticipates Wynnewood will continue to receive Small Refinery Exemptions (SREs) for the 2017-2024 period despite ongoing regulatory uncertainty. Risk Factors and Structural Changes The RFS obligation at Wynnewood is currently 2 to 3 times the total personnel costs of the facility, representing a significant structural headwind. A $1 billion senior notes offering was completed post-quarter end to extend the debt maturity profile and redeem higher-interest 2029 notes. The loss of the blenders tax credit and declining HOBO spreads drove the Renewable segment to a breakeven adjusted EBITDA before its conversion. Management explicitly flagged 'disproportionate economic harm' from RFS compliance and vowed to continue legal and regulatory challenges against the EPA. Q&A Session Highlights Our analysts just identified a stock with the potential to be the next Nvidia. Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Story Continues Strategic approach and criteria for proactive M&A expansion Management intends to engage in bilateral discussions to identify opportunities outside of competitive auctions for both refining and fertilizer assets. Strict discipline will be maintained: deals must be accretive to shareholders and must not 'stretch the balance sheet' or require excessive leverage. Sequencing of debt repayment versus dividend restoration The company does not believe it must reach its $1 billion gross leverage target before reinstating a dividend, but it requires a 'clear path' to further deleveraging. The primary goal is a dividend level that is sustainable in both 'good crack markets and bad' to avoid a 'yo-yo' effect. Impact of rising RIN prices and mitigation strategies Management attributed the rise in RIN prices to a proposed higher RVO (Renewable Volume Obligation) that has not yet been finalized. Strategies to minimize exposure include increasing internal blending capacity and potentially acquiring retail or additional blending assets through M&A. One stock.

What happened According to a February 4, 2026, SEC filing , Valley Wealth Managers, Inc. sold 479,832 shares of Sonoco Products Company, with the transaction’s estimated value at $19.9 million based on the mean closing price for the quarter. The value of the fund’s position declined by $20.7 million quarter over quarter, reflecting both the share sale and price fluctuations during the period.

The company’s scale and integrated approach enable it to serve both industrial and consumer markets with tailored, value-added packaging products. Sonoco’s broad geographic reach and focus on innovation support its competitive position in the packaging industry. What this transaction means for investors Sonoco Products is a relatively slow-growing business. While its revenue surged 42% in 2025, it has a history of low top-line growth. Valley Wealth Managers sold the stock in the quarter, while adding to other top positions in the Vanguard Russell 1000 Growth ETF and Apple . Story Continues Valley Wealth also reduced stakes in other top positions, such as AI chipmaker Broadcom and Alphabet . These tech stocks have had major runs over the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.

What Happened According to a SEC filing dated February 13, 2026, Shannon River Fund Management LLC sold 125,230 shares of InterDigital during the fourth quarter. The estimated transaction value is $44.28 million, based on the average closing price for the quarter. The fund’s position in InterDigital dropped from 9.9% of assets under management to 2.67%, with a period-end value of $17.03 million. The net change in position value for the quarter was $44.67 million. What Else to Know This was a significant reduction, with InterDigital now representing 2.67% of the fund’s 13F assets under management.

InterDigital, Inc. specializes in developing and licensing advanced wireless and video technologies, with a strong focus on 2G through 5G networks, IoT, and multimedia applications. Its extensive patent portfolio underpins its licensing-driven business model, providing critical intellectual property to a wide range of technology manufacturers worldwide. The company's scale and deep R&D capabilities position it as a key enabler of next-generation connectivity and digital innovation. What This Transaction Means for Investors Shannon River, a New York-based hedge fund, recently sold roughly $44 million worth of InterDigital (IDCC) stock during the fourth quarter (the three months ending on Dec. 31, 2025). That reduced its position in the technology stock by about 75%. Here’s what it means for investors. Story Continues First off, we should recognize that IDCC stock has been on quite the run. Over the last three years, shares have advanced by 397%, equating to an exceptional compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 69.4%. Therefore, it’s possible, and perhaps likely, that Shannon River is simply taking profits in a stock that has delivered astonishing returns. Looking ahead, there are a few things investors should know about IDCC stock. In the plus column, the company is riding high. Revenue and net income are both near record-high levels. IDCC has secured several key legal victories ensuring the ability to monetize its patent portfolio. What’s more, management has provided upbeat revenue and earnings guidance for 2026. On other hand, the stock’s long run of success could prove a new challenge. In particular, the stock’s valuation is now gaining increased scrutiny. IDCC’s price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple now stands at 30x. That’s near its highest level in three years and nearly double its three-year average PE multiple of 17x. In summary, Shannon River’s sale of IDCC is likely prudent portfolio management. After all, on balance, IDCC’s overall business fundamentals look solid given its near-record revenue and its bullish guidance. However, valuation concerns could temper demand for IDCC stock at its current level. Should you buy stock in InterDigital right now?

Q4 2025 Earnings Call Summary - Moby Strategic Performance Drivers Achieved 9% rebased adjusted OIBDA growth in 2025, driven by aggressive cost initiatives and a 2 percentage point reduction in P&E additions as a percentage of revenue. Performance was bolstered by the migration of over 225,000 mobile postpaid subscribers, particularly in Costa Rica and Puerto Rico, enhancing revenue predictability. Puerto Rico reached a critical turning point with its first positive postpaid net adds since the network migration, supported by the launch of the 'Liberty Mix' multiline plan. B2B segment strength, representing nearly one-third of group revenue, was driven by high-speed internet wins in Panama and expanding IT-as-a-Service solutions. Management attributed the 27% increase in adjusted OIBDA less P&E additions to a disciplined capital allocation strategy and improved operational efficiency across credit silos. The group successfully navigated significant headwinds from Hurricane Melissa, which impacted fixed infrastructure in Jamaica but demonstrated the resilience of the mobile network. 2026 Outlook and Strategic Priorities Management targets a return to pre-hurricane profitability levels in Jamaica by the end of 2026, utilizing $81 million in net weather derivative proceeds for reconstruction. Financial performance in 2026 is expected to be heavily weighted toward the second half of the year due to the timing of the Jamaican recovery and project spending. The company anticipates a $100 million adjusted free cash flow impact from Hurricane Melissa in 2026, with a full recovery projected for 2027. Strategic focus remains on Fixed-Mobile Convergence (FMC) to increase household ARPU and reduce churn, alongside the deployment of 5G standalone in partnership with Ericsson. Liberty Networks is positioned for long-term recurring revenue growth through the El Salvador subsea cable project and the MANTA joint build, expected to be operational by late 2027. Structural Changes and Risk Factors The company is actively working on the structural separation of Liberty Puerto Rico from the broader LLA group to unlock shareholder value. Liberty Puerto Rico is undergoing a liability management exercise to address high leverage (14x covenant leverage) and may require additional liquidity for operating costs. Fixed network assets in Jamaica were reduced by 133,000 homes passed where service restoration is not foreseen in the near term following hurricane damage. The rejection of the Tigo merger in Costa Rica has shifted management's focus toward organic cost reduction and margin expansion within that specific market.

AI implementation and partnership strategy with AWS versus Google Management clarified that the AWS partnership is a deep integration for internal compute and customer cloud migration, rather than just a reseller agreement. AI is currently being deployed in call centers (e.g., Costa Rica) to automate repetitive processes, with the goal of translating these efficiencies into tangible free cash flow expansion. Sustainability of Fixed-Mobile Convergence (FMC) and revenue growth The 'golden product' is linking postpaid mobile with fixed broadband, which management noted increases ARPU and significantly lowers churn across all markets.

Q4 2025 Earnings Call Summary - Moby Strategic Performance Drivers Delivered a third consecutive year of operating ROE improvement to 16.2%, outperforming the long-term target of 12% to 15% through disciplined risk selection. Achieved 1.5 points of year-over-year improvement in core underwriting earnings quality, supported by an eighth consecutive quarter of attritional loss ratio improvement. Shifted portfolio mix toward less volatile lines, with 60% of growth coming from sectors less correlated to P&C pricing cycles, notably Accident & Health. Crystallized $390 million in liquidity and nearly $200 million in off-balance sheet value through the strategic sales of Armada and Arcadian MGAs. Maintained a lower volatility profile by prioritizing insurance growth over reinsurance, while utilizing reinsurance as a flexible tool for MGA partnerships. Applied a highly selective distribution strategy, rejecting over 90% of MGA opportunities to ensure alignment on underwriting excellence and data sharing. Strengthened the leadership team by welcoming 18 senior leaders and promoting 6 from within, reflecting improved talent attraction and employee engagement. 2026 Outlook and Strategic Initiatives Anticipates tougher market conditions in 2026, particularly in property catastrophe, but expects to maintain performance levels through a diversified, niche-focused portfolio. Projects the IMG business to generate over $30 million in fee income and $35 million in EBITDA in 2026, bolstered by the acquisitions of Assist America and World Nomads. Models a go-forward effective tax rate of approximately 19% and an OUE expense ratio maintained between 6.5% and 7%. Intends to repurchase $100 million of common shares over the next 12 months, expected to be accretive to EPS and ROE throughout 2026. Implemented a new property aggregate program for 2026 that attaches at $90 million of losses to protect against the frequency of small-to-medium catastrophe events. Capital Management and Risk Factors Redeeming $200 million of 8% preference shares in February 2026 to reduce the leverage ratio to a historic low of 23%. Identified pricing challenges in public D&O and commercial auto, leading to a substantial reduction in premium and exposure in those lines. Noted that the current book value likely understates the company's true value due to the conservative valuation of the 100% owned IMG MGA. Maintained significant remaining limits on three loss portfolio transfers (2021, 2023, 2024), providing a robust buffer for legacy liabilities.

Story Continues Sustainability of underwriting margins amid 2026 market headwinds Management believes the 91.7% insurance combined ratio is a sustainable run rate, with potential 0.5 point fluctuations based on business mix. Strategic insulation is expected from niche MGA partnerships and lines like Accident & Health and Surety that do not follow general P&C rate cycles. Fee income trajectory following the Armada sale Excluding Armada, the fee income run rate is approximately $30 million, with a target of $40 million plus EBITDA once new acquisitions are fully integrated. World Nomads integration is expected to contribute materially starting in 2027, including channeling underwriting business to the A&H division. Growth sustainability in the Surety business line Management dismissed concerns regarding data center or government infrastructure booms as 'red herrings' for their specific book. The company views its Surety portfolio as being in the 'early innings' of build-out, with significant tailwinds expected for 2026. One stock.

Q4 2025 Earnings Call Summary - Moby Strategic Execution and Portfolio Optimization Performance in Q4 2025 was driven by sequential margin expansion resulting from higher acuity, improved payer mix, and sustained cost controls. Management attributed growth in specific markets to targeted capital investments, such as ER expansions in Knoxville and a $10 million women's services investment in Birmingham. The company successfully reduced leverage from 7.4x to 6.6x year-over-year through a combination of operational improvements and the application of divestiture proceeds to debt reduction. Strategic focus has shifted toward 'networks of care,' where smaller rural hospitals serve as essential access points for higher-acuity services within larger metropolitan hubs. Operational efficiency was bolstered by the full-year implementation of a unified Oracle ERP system, which standardized data and provided approximately $50 million in cost savings. Management acknowledged temporary disruptions in 2025 caused by economic impacts on patient behavior and regulatory uncertainty regarding reimbursement and insurance coverage. 2026 Outlook and Strategic Priorities 2026 guidance assumes a 'jump-off point' EBITDA of $1.36 billion after adjusting for divestitures and one-time items, reflecting roughly 4% growth in core operations. Management expects a $20 million to $30 million EBITDA headwind from potential Health Insurance Marketplace (HICS) enrollment reductions due to subsidy expirations and administrative reforms. Financial projections assume a 4% increase in Medicare inpatient rates for 2026, the highest such increase in recent management memory. Medical specialist fees are projected to face upward pressure of 5% to 8% in 2026, primarily driven by anesthesia and radiology costs. The company anticipates a $140 million headwind to 2026 cash flows from operations due to an extra biweekly pay period (27 pay dates versus the standard 26). Capital Structure and Risk Factors Net debt is projected to decrease to approximately $9.2 billion following the completion of the Huntsville divestiture, down from $10.1 billion at year-end 2025 and $11.4 billion at year-end 2024. The divestiture of three Pennsylvania hospitals, while representing $0.5 billion in annual revenue, was described as essentially EBITDA breakeven. Management noted that 'programmatic divestitures' are nearing completion, with future transactions likely to be opportunistic rather than structural. 2025 results included $45 million in non-recurring EBITDA benefits from Tennessee State Directed Payments and opioid settlements that will not repeat in 2026. Story Continues Q&A Session Highlights Our analysts just identified a stock with the potential to be the next Nvidia. Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Future divestiture strategy and portfolio pruning limits Management stated they are nearing the end of their programmatic divestiture phase but remain open to opportunistic deals that allow for material deleveraging. The current portfolio is viewed as a stable core, with interest in selling assets 'dwindling' as the focus shifts to internal growth. Impact of HICS enrollment declines on margins Management clarified that HICS represents less than 5% of revenue and that the EBITDA impact is mitigated by low historical collection rates on co-pays from this population. A hypothetical 20% volume reduction in HICS is modeled as a $100 million to $120 million revenue loss but only a $20 million to $30 million EBITDA hit. AI implementation and technology-driven cost savings The company is deploying AI for autonomous coding, virtual patient sitters to prevent falls, and ambient listening for clinical documentation. Management expects the maturing ERP system to provide further runway for savings beyond the $50 million captured in 2025 through better supply chain visibility and system consolidation. One stock.

(Photo by Ludovic MARIN / AFP) | Image Credits:Ludovic MARIN/AFP / Getty Images What would have been a moment of united commitment to global tech innovation at the ongoing India AI Impact Summit instead proved an awkward one: When Prime Minister Narendra Modi prompted speakers at the event to join hands and raise them in a show of solidarity, all executives onstage obliged — except OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Anthropic’s Dario Amodei, who held their hands noticeably apart. More from Yahoo Scout What happened at the India AI Impact Summit? Why did the CEOs refuse to hold hands? How are OpenAI and Anthropic expanding in India? What caused tension between OpenAI and Anthropic CEOs? As leaders of the two foremost labs in the AI race, it goes without saying that Altman and Amodei are fierce competitors. That rivalry has only intensified in recent months: After OpenAI said it would bring advertisements to ChatGPT, Anthropic took a swipe at OpenAI in a couple ads during the Super Bowl, declaring that it would never introduce ads into Claude. Altman soon after hit back in response , calling Anthropic “dishonest” and “authoritarian.” “We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid, and we know our users would reject that,” he wrote at the time. Both Altman and Amodei were in India this week for the AI summit held in New Delhi, which saw a bevy of AI-related investments, features, and products being announced. OpenAI said it is opening two new offices in India, partnering with IT giant TCS , and deploying tools for higher education . Anthropic has also opened an office in India and teamed up with Infosys for internal and external deployment of its AI tools . Terms and Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices More Info",

Q4 2025 Earnings Call Summary - Moby Strategic Performance and Operational Drivers Achieved record organic growth with 72,000 room openings, a 13% increase over the previous year, driven by strong conversion activity and new construction prototypes. Global development pipeline expanded to 260,000 rooms, featuring a 30% domestic fee-par premium compared to the existing system, which management expects to enhance future margins. Domestic RevPAR declined 4% for the full year, primarily attributed to softness in Texas, California, and Florida, which represent one-quarter of the U.S. room count. International growth was led by a 14% direct franchising increase in China and 9% overall international net room growth, despite deflationary pressures in the Chinese economy. Ancillary fee streams grew 15% for the full year, fueled by strategic partnerships, a record 54% domestic direct loyalty occupancy, and momentum in co-branded credit card programs. Management noted that excluding hurricane impacts, U.S. RevPAR declined 6% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by continued softness in the company's three largest states—Texas, California, and Florida—which saw an 11% decline. Operational efficiencies were realized through the deployment of over 350 AI agents, which management claims reduced on-property labor costs while driving direct booking capture. 2026 Outlook and Strategic Assumptions Full-year 2026 net room growth is projected between 4% and 4.5%, excluding potential impacts from the Revo Hospitality Group insolvency proceedings. Global RevPAR guidance ranges from up 0.5% to down 1.5%, assuming U.S. RevPAR remains approximately flat from the second through fourth quarters. Management anticipates a first-quarter headwind due to the termination of 3,000 legacy rooms, primarily sourced from Travel + Leisure and Vacasa managed properties. The 2026 financial outlook conservatively excludes all revenue recognition from the Revo franchisee until collectibility is certain, representing a $12 million royalty headwind. Capital allocation plans include deploying approximately $110 million in development advances to continue securing high-fee-par rooms in accretive markets. Non-Recurring Items and Risk Factors Recorded $160 million in non-cash charges related to the insolvency of European franchisee Revo Hospitality Group, impacting loan values and intangible assets. Management characterized the Revo insolvency as a unique outlier due to its high concentration, noting that no other franchisee holds more than 5% of outstanding development advances. A 5% increase in the quarterly cash dividend was authorized for 2026, reflecting management's confidence in the business model's 60% free cash flow conversion rate. Identified potential macro tailwinds for late 2026, including infrastructure spend, the FIFA World Cup, and potential government stimulus ahead of midterm elections.

Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Management reported that January U.S. RevPAR improved to down 4% and February trends are continuing to strengthen as comps become easier. Occupancy recovery is most pronounced in the economy and midscale segments compared to 2019 levels, though ADR still lags inflation by 1,500 basis points. Impact and recovery strategy regarding the Revo insolvency Management clarified that while the hotels remain in the system, all related revenue is being deferred until legal proceedings conclude, which could take many months. The company emphasized that total loan exposure to other franchisees is limited to approximately $20 million, mitigating broader systemic risk. Monetization and efficiency gains from AI initiatives AI agents are driving over 300 basis points of incremental direct contribution for participating franchisees by handling guest calls and upselling amenities. Management is establishing direct API connections with major LLMs like Claude and ChatGPT to ensure data accuracy and bypass web scraping. Infrastructure demand trends and government business impact Infrastructure-related demand was a slight drag in 2025 due to federal government shutdowns, but contracted room nights are currently pacing at twice the consumed levels.

Buy Button by Formatoriginal via Shutterstock Wajeeh Khan Thu, February 19, 2026 at 6:52 AM PST 2 min read RXT PLTR Rackspace Technology (RXT) shares more than tripled on Wednesday after the Nasdaq-listed firm announced a new strategic partnership with Palantir Technologies (PLTR). This massive surge of retail interest pushed RXT’s relative strength index (14-day) into the late 70s, indicating extremely overbought conditions that often precede a sharp correction. Despite its meteoric run, however, Rackspace stock remains down more than 50% versus its 52-week high. More News from Barchart Has Palantir Bottomed? Probably, Based on Huge, Unusual Put Options Activity in PLTR SoftBank Just Sold $3.6 Billion Worth of Nvidia Stock. Should You Ditch NVDA Too? Rackspace Stock Is Soaring on a Palantir Partnership. Should You Chase RXT Shares Here? Tired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now! www.barchart.com Does Palantir Deal Still Warrant Buying RXT Shares? While the aforementioned technical setup suggests RXT stock could pull back in the near-term, it’s still reasonable to consider investing in it at current levels. Why? Because the PLTR agreement positions Rackspace as a critical implementation and managed services provider for enterprises seeking to deploy its Foundry and Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). It effectively addresses a significant market gap where organizations struggle to extract meaningful value from AI platforms due to limited in-house expertise in deploying and operating systems at scale. Over time, this strategic partnership could help Rackspace Technology improve its revenue growth and stabilize margins. Where Options Data Suggests Rackspace Stock Is Headed While RXT remains a penny stock, which often means higher risk, those following technical indicators should note that it now sits decisively above its key moving averages (MAs). This suggests that upward momentum could sustain in the near term as bulls have firmly taken control across multiple timeframes. Additionally, derivatives data for Rackspace shares remains largely skewed to the upside. Options contracts expiring mid-May have the upper price set at $2.27 currently, indicating potential upside of another 60% from here. It's also worth mentioning that RXT at just 0.12x sales is still an inexpensive name to own, especially given its commitment to transforming into a critical enabler of high-value AI workloads. How Wall Street Recommends Playing Rackspace Technology According to Barchart, some Wall Street firms also believe that Rackspace Technology could push higher still through the remainder of 2026. Story Continues While the consensus rating on RXT shares remains at a “Hold,\" price targets on this Texas-based company go as high as $1.75, signaling potential for a nearly 30% rally from current levels. www.barchart.com This article was created with the support of automated content tools from our partners at Sigma.AI.

Our costs were above annual guidance reflecting the same factors. Despite the setbacks, we delivered a number of financial records, including revenue of $1,800,000,000, record free cash flow of over $350,000,000 while funding our high-return growth projects. Supported by strong free cash flow generation, we doubled our shareholder returns, further strengthened our balance sheet by reducing our debt, and eliminated more of the hedges inherited from the Argonaut Gold transaction, giving us increased exposure to higher gold price. Looking ahead to 2026, we expect a meaningful improvement in operational performance to drive a 12% increase in production. This will be driven by the ramp-up of mining rates at Island Gold as part of the Phase 3 Plus expansion, as well as higher mining rates at Young-Davidson. We expect further growth in production at lower costs in the coming years as we deliver on the larger Island Gold District expansion by 2028 and bring Lynn Lake into production by 2029. Our longer-term outlook remains firmly on track to nearly double our annual production to approximately over 1,000,000 ounces a year at lower costs. Now turning to Slide 4, over the past month, we outlined the key drivers of our strong outlook. As detailed in our updated three-year guidance, we expect to deliver a 46% increase in production at approximately 20% lower all-in sustaining costs by 2028. We also provided exploration updates on our mines and exploration projects, highlighting significant upside potential across our portfolio. Our successful exploration program in 2025 contributed to a 32% increase in year-end mineral reserves to 16,000,000 ounces, marking the seventh consecutive year of growth. This included a near doubling of reserves at Island Gold District to over 8,000,000 ounces. As announced earlier this month, this growth is being incorporated into a larger expansion of the district, which is expected to create one of the largest, longest-life, and most profitable gold operations in Canada. This is a high-return expansion that the Island Gold District can fund on its own, contributing to our increasing free cash flow. Reflecting this strong outlook and growing free cash flow, we were pleased to announce a 60% increase in our dividend commencing this quarter. As outlined in the expansion study, we will be expanding milling rates to 20,000 tonnes per day. The higher rate is supported by increased mining rates per day from the open pit, 3,000 tonnes per day from underground, and 17,000 tonnes. Story Continues With the completion of the expansion in 2028, annual production from the Island Gold District is expected to average 534,000 ounces of gold for the initial ten years at lower mine site all-in sustaining costs of $1,025 per ounce. This is more than double the 2025 production and at 30% lower costs. At a conservative $3,200 per ounce gold price, the operation will generate in excess of $800,000,000 of annual free cash flow and have an after-tax net present value of $8,200,000,000, and at a gold price of $4,500 per ounce, the after-tax NPV increases to $12,000,000,000, making the Island Gold District one of the largest and most valuable gold operations in Canada. Now turning to Slide 6. Our three-year guidance outlined a clear path to reach 800,000 ounces of gold production by 2028 at nearly 20% lower all-in sustaining costs of approximately $1,250 per ounce. Longer term, the completion of the Island Gold District expansion in 2028 and initial production from Lynn Lake in 2029 is expected to drive our production to approximately 1,000,000 ounces per year by the end of the decade, with a further decrease in costs. We have one of the best growth profiles in the sector, and we can fund all our growth internally while we continue to generate increasing free cash flow. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Greg Fisher, who will review our financial performance. Greg? Greg Fisher: Thank you, John. Moving to Slide 7, we sold 142,000 ounces of gold in the fourth quarter at an average realized price of $3,998 per ounce for record quarterly revenues of $575,000,000. For the full year, we sold 531,000 ounces at a realized price of $3,372 per ounce for record annual revenues of $1,800,000,000, up 34% from 2024. Our full-year total cash cost of $1,077 per ounce and all-in sustaining cost of $1,524 per ounce were above annual guidance, driven by higher costs in the fourth quarter and the temporary challenges at our Canadian operations. Operating cash flow before changes in non-cash working capital was $285,000,000 in the fourth quarter, or $0.68 per share. This was reduced by $63,000,000, or $0.15 per share, reflecting the cash utilized to eliminate the legacy Argonaut Gold hedges prior to maturity. For the full year, operating cash flow before changes in non-cash working capital increased 27% to a record $924,000,000 or $2.20 per share. Our reported net earnings were $435,000,000 in the fourth quarter, or $1.03 per share. This included a $227,000,000 after-tax gain on the sale of non-core assets, a loss on commodity hedge derivatives of $35,000,000, and other adjustments of $16,000,000. Excluding these items, our adjusted net earnings were $228,000,000 or $0.54 per share. Our full-year adjusted net earnings were $587,000,000 or $1.40 per share. Capital spending in the quarter totaled $158,000,000 and included $50,000,000 of sustaining capital, $97,000,000 of growth capital, and $11,000,000 of capitalized exploration. For the full year, total capital expenditures were $507,000,000, including growth capital of $318,000,000. We continue to fund our high-return growth internally while generating strong free cash flow, including a record $157,000,000 of free cash flow generated in the fourth quarter and a record $352,000,000 for the full year. Reflecting our growing free cash flow and strong financial position, we returned $81,000,000 to shareholders in 2025, double the amount returned in 2024. This includes the repurchase of 1,300,000 shares at a cost of $39,000,000 and dividend payments totaling $42,000,000. With additional free cash flow growth ahead, we expect further increases in our shareholder returns, starting with a 60% increase in our dividend this quarter. We also paid down $50,000,000 of debt and eliminated half the 2026 legacy hedges inherited from Argonaut Gold. To date, we have now repurchased and eliminated 230,000 out of the 330,000 ounces hedged by Argonaut prior to maturity, providing increased exposure to the rising gold price. We will continue to look for opportunities to eliminate the remaining 100,000 ounces subject to hedges across 2026 and 2027. Given our strong free cash flow, our cash position grew 90% from 2024 to $623,000,000 while reducing our debt to $200,000,000. We expect growing production and declining costs to drive increasing free cash flow over the next several years while we continue to fund our organic growth plans. With that, I will turn the call over to our COO, Luc Guimond, to provide an overview of our operations. Luc? Luc Guimond: Thank you, Greg. Over to Slide 8. Fourth quarter production from the Island Gold District totaled 60,000 ounces, a 10% decline over the previous quarter due to lower underground mining rates as well as reduced mill throughput.

It prompted an audible, “Oh, wow!” and I knew I had to tell you about it. Because while these types of moments do not always turn into major market moves, sometimes they do. And as I always say, long-term trend changes start with short-term price action. More News from Barchart Has Palantir Bottomed? Probably, Based on Huge, Unusual Put Options Activity in PLTR SoftBank Just Sold $3.6 Billion Worth of Nvidia Stock. Should You Ditch NVDA Too? Rackspace Stock Is Soaring on a Palantir Partnership. Should You Chase RXT Shares Here? Tired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now! At issue is the Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ). This ETF is big and powerful, the closest thing the ETF world has to omnipotent. The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) gets the biggest “pub” from investors, but QQQ is where the consistently magnificent returns have come from. So it matters when any type of potential crack makes itself evident. I see one now. Below is QQQ’s daily chart. It is weeping like a tree — the kind that weep, anyway. The 20-day moving average (in red) is about three weeks into a downtrend, and the 50-day has joined it in the loss column. The 200-day EMA is flat, and that in itself is remarkable. That hasn’t happened much the past two years, as you can see below. It has been a series of long positive moves, interrupted by occasional short bursts to the downside. What makes QQQ the “king” of this market is its resilience. Small caps? Forget about ‘em! Dow Industrials (DIA)? Old fashioned — not to me, but to many traders and media personalities, too. International stocks? Maybe next century. But QQQ? Ah, the once and future leader of all things stock market. But suddenly, it is showing its human side, so to speak. QQQ’s Chart Looks Ominous From This Angle www.barchart.com Those moving averages are slipping, but so is the PPO, my all-time favorite momentum indicator. It just dipped under the zero line, which is a big deal to me. Does this mean QQQ crashes soon? That’s an impossible question. And more to the point, it is irrelevant. If you learn how to hedge — with collars, other option strategies, inverse ETFs, position sizing, etc. — you can invest in anything. This is less about timing, and more about a gathering docket of evidence. QQQ is bent, not broken. But you don’t get a serious market reversal (downward) without some bending action first. This is not a new situation. It has been rolling over subtly for weeks. But what made me utter something I can’t write here was this hourly chart below. That’s a three-week downtrend, which again reversed at exactly where it should ($610 area) on Wednesday afternoon. I’ll point out that what turned a nice positive day for QQQ into a 1% intra-day dip in about 150 minutes, started a full hour before the Fed’s latest minutes came out. Story Continues www.barchart.com This is micro-analysis, as I see it. But the goal in charting multiple time frames is that the evidence starts to pile on itself. That’s what I’m watching carefully in the days and weeks to come. OK, What Else You Got? We technicians like to talk about “confirmation.” That’s when multiple indicators and signals corroborate each other’s conclusions. As regular readers of mine know, I created my own confirmation indicator, that I trained to read the chart for me, as a productivity tool and portfolio-building factor. That’s the ROAR score. And while I had one “out loud” moment in viewing the short-term QQQ chart I showed you above, I had another one when I was reviewing ROAR scores and saw this. Chart courtesy of Rob Isbitts via ROAR.PiTrade.com. QQQ has been knocked down to a score of 20. Loosely translated, that means it has about a 4:1 change of substantial decline going forward, versus a strong rally. I’m not talking about the next few points in either direction. That’s noise. I’m talking about breaking the months-long pattern that has QQQ trading where it did more than four months ago. In this market, for buy-the-dips-trained investors, that’s a lifetime. The other thing I track constantly in my trading is a different type of sync up activity. With upcoming market news and events. And last I checked, Nvidia’s (NVDA) earnings are next week. And that’s hardly the only macro news on tap between now and February-end. And yes, you read that right. NVDA is macro news now. QQQ’s direction will lean heavily on it, along with the other handful of stocks that crowd the top of the Nasdaq 100 Index. Time to pay close attention.

Applying fertelizer by Etienne Girardet via Unsplash Pathikrit Bose Thu, February 19, 2026 at 10:08 AM CST 6 min read SFM AMD AMZN META TSLA Hedge fund manager Philippe Laffont is known for making outsized and successful bets on disruptive technology companies. Through his fund Coatue Management, the 58-year-old not only made lucrative bets on public companies like Tesla (TSLA) and AMD (AMD), but he was also one of the early investors in TikTok-parent ByteDance, Spotify (SPOT), and Instacart (CART). A recent 13F filing shedding light on his latest set of transactions revealed some interesting moves by Laffont, wherein he substantially increased his holdings of streaming and e-commerce giants Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN), respectively, while trimming his stake in Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) and Meta (META). However, one company, far removed from the tech space, grabbed attention. Curiously, Laffont initiated a position in Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM). More News from Barchart Has Palantir Bottomed?

About Sprouts Farmers Market Founded in 2002, Sprouts Farmers Market is one of the largest specialty health-food retailers in the U.S. Sprouts operates as a \"healthy grocery store\" with an open-air farmers market layout. Unlike traditional grocers, fresh produce is located at the center of the store rather than the perimeter. They focus on natural, organic, and \"attribute-driven\" products. As of early 2026, the company operates over 450 stores across roughly 24 states and continues to expand its footprint across the U.S. with new store openings in markets such as Houston’s Kingwood suburb and the Bay Area in California, reflecting geographic expansion and strategic market penetration. Valued at a market cap of $6.6 billion, the SFM stock is down 14% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis. Notably, Laffont bought about 601,886 shares of the company, whose stock reached an all-time high in 2025. What led to this rise, and how come it was able to convince a tech native like Laffont to buy its shares? Let's find out. www.barchart.com Solid Financials Served Fresh Sprouts has displayed steady growth rates. Over the past 10 years, its revenues and earnings have clocked CAGRs of 9.80% and 15.79%, respectively. It may not be spectacular, but the company has grown sustainably, as evidenced by the manageable amount of debt on its books. Story Continues Moreover, the latest quarter saw the company reporting a beat on earnings, the ninth straight instance of doing so. While net sales climbed by 13% from the previous year to $2.2 billion, accompanied by a comparable sales growth rate of 5.9%, earnings went up by 34.1% in the same period to $1.22 per share. Notably, the EPS of $1.22 came in ahead of the consensus estimate of $1.18. The company opened nine new stores in Q3 2025 while increasing its net cash from operating activities to $577.5 million for the nine months ended Sept. 28, 2025, from $520.4 million in the year-ago period. Overall, the company closed the quarter with a cash balance of $322.42 million, higher than its short-term debt levels of $172.21 million. For the fourth quarter, the company expects its EPS to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.90, the midpoint of which would denote a year-over-year (YoY) growth rate of 11.4%. The company is set to report its Q4 results today post-market. Currently, SFM stock is also trading at undervalued levels, with its forward P/E, P/S, and P/CF of 12.82, 0.75, and 8.40, lower than the sector medians of 16.68, 1.08, and 11.93, respectively. Cultivating Growth With Strong Operations The financials may look attractive for SFM; however, what may have made the deal for Laffont is the company's way of functioning and its fresh offerings, which make it easy for consumers to trust the brand and drive sales. At the core of Sprouts' proposition lies its \"Attribute-Driven\" merchandising. Unlike conventional stores that stock a broad array of mass-market goods, Sprouts curates approximately 70% of its inventory around specific consumer trends such as keto, plant-based, and non-GMO products. This creates a \"treasure hunt\" experience that drives high customer engagement. Also, the company’s \"Sprouts Brand\" private label has grown to represent over 25% of total sales, providing a dual benefit of higher profit margins and increased brand loyalty. In 2024 alone, the company introduced over 7,100 new products, utilizing its \"Innovation Centers\" to test and scale emerging brands faster than its competitors. The next aspect is right up Laffont's alley and must have certainly played its part in him buying Sprouts shares. To maintain its edge, Sprouts has aggressively integrated AI into its backend operations. The company utilizes machine learning algorithms to optimize inventory management, particularly for its high-turnover perishable items, which account for nearly 60% of its revenue. By predicting demand with higher precision, Sprouts has successfully reduced product waste, contributing to a 60 bps increase in gross margins in late 2025. Additionally, the full rollout of the Sprouts Rewards loyalty program in 2025 has allowed the company to deploy AI-driven personalized marketing, tailoring promotions to individual shopping habits and increasing the average \"basket size\" per visit. The company is currently executing a disciplined \"smaller-format\" expansion plan. Moving away from massive 30,000+ square foot footprints, Sprouts is now opening stores at approximately 23,000 square feet. This model requires less capital to build, allows for faster site selection in dense urban markets, and reaches profitability more quickly. As of early 2026, the company has a pipeline of over 140 approved locations and intends to grow its store count by 10% annually through 2027. However, despite its strengths, shareholders must remain mindful of significant headwinds. The most immediate concern is the securities litigation filed in late 2025, which alleges the company provided misleading growth projections during a period of consumer softening. Furthermore, as traditional retailers like Amazon (AMZN)-owned Whole Foods and Walmart (WMT) expand their organic offerings, price competition in the \"natural\" space is intensifying. There is also the risk of \"cannibalization\" as the company densifies its store count in existing markets like Florida and California. Analyst Opinion of SFM Stock Thus, analysts remain cautiously optimistic about the SFM stock, attributing to it a rating of “Moderate Buy,” with a mean target price of $105.92. This indicates an upside potential of about 56% from current levels. Out of 16 analysts covering the stock, seven have a “Strong Buy” rating, one has a “Moderate Buy” rating, and eight have a “Hold” rating. www.barchart.com On the date of publication, Pathikrit Bose did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE: NOG ) is included among the 12 Best Crude Oil Stocks to Buy as Tensions Rise . Analyst Reduces Northern Oil and Gas (NOG) Price Target to $24 Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NYSE:NOG) is the largest publicly traded, non-operated upstream energy asset owner in the United States, engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas properties. On January 23, Morgan Stanley lowered the firm’s price target on Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NYSE:NOG) from $26 to $24, but maintained its ‘Underweight’ rating on the shares. The firm updated its 2026-27 oil price forecasts as of January 7, in conjunction with its Q4 preview for E&Ps, oil majors, and Canadian producers. The analyst expects the Q4 operational updates to be ‘fairly clean’, while it projects lighter cash flow from price realizations. Earlier on January 21, Mizuho also slightly reduced its price target on Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NYSE:NOG) from $30 to $29, while keeping an ‘Outperform’ rating on the shares. The revised target, which still indicates an upside of over 13% from current levels, is part of the firm’s Q4 preview. The analyst cited wider natural gas differentials as the reason for the lowered target, but noted that NOG should see some stabilization in activity this year. While we acknowledge the potential of NOG as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

(NYSE:VIST) is a leading independent operator, with its main assets in Vaca Muerta, the largest shale oil and shale gas play under development outside North America. Vista Energy, S.A.B. de C.V. (NYSE:VIST) received a boost on February 4 when BofA resumed coverage of the stock with a ‘Buy’ rating and a price target of $88, indicating an upside of over 63% from the current share price. The move comes after Vista announced the acquisition of Equinor’s onshore business in Argentina’s Vaca Muerta basin on February 2. The $1.1 billion deal includes the Norwegian energy giant’s 30% stake in the Bandurria Sur production asset and its 50% holding in Bajo del Toro. The Bandurria Sur assets produced an average of 24,400 boed in the third quarter of 2025, while Bajo del Toro, which is still in an early development phase, reported an output of 2,100 net boed. Miguel Galuccio, CEO of Vista Energy, S.A.B. de C.V. (NYSE:VIST), commented: “The blocks fit perfectly into Vista’s portfolio, adding both flowing barrels and a deep inventory of highly productive, ready-to-drill wells that will underpin our growth trajectory.” BofA views the transaction as positive when concluded. The firm estimates a potential IRR of 24% for the proposed acquisition under its Brent crude price assumptions.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the press release or in the presentation posted this morning to the Investor Relations section of our website at yeti.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Matthew. Thanks, Arvind, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining today. Matthew J. Reintjes: The strong performance YETI delivered in Q4 is a direct result of growing brand strength and disciplined, consistent execution of our long-term strategy. Just as important, our Q4 results give us increasing conviction in the long-term trajectory of the brand, our ability to accelerate growth and profitability, and to generate strong returns for our shareholders. There are three themes I want to emphasize this morning. First, our strong finish to 2025 sets the stage for meaningful global growth and profitability in 2026 and beyond. Second, our product innovation engine is operating with more speed, breadth, and global capability than ever. Story Continues Third, our expanding global brand combined with a broader, higher velocity product portfolio will be the driving force behind the next phase of YETI's growth. Beginning with our Q4 performance, we closed out 2025 with our strongest quarter of the year, delivering 5% net sales growth fueled by continued momentum across the YETI brand. Drinkware grew 6% and international delivered 25% growth, marking our best quarterly performance of the year for both. Gross margins exceeded expectations, even in an intense tariff and promotional holiday environment thanks to YETI's premium brand strengths, innovation across the portfolio, and operational execution. We once again delivered strong full-year free cash flow of $212,000,000, exceeding adjusted net income and underscoring the cash generating strength of our operating model. We executed a $125,000,000 in share repurchase during Q4, bringing the full year total to approximately $300,000,000. Across the business, demand remained solid, our portfolio is more diversified, more global, and more durable, with momentum across categories, channels, and markets. This performance is a result of deliberate multiyear actions. Grounding and broadening Drinkware, expanding bags and soft coolers within coolers and equipment, investing in our innovation footprint, globalizing the brand, and reinforcing supply chain diversification and resilience. These decisions have positioned us well for sustained multiyear growth. Looking ahead, we entered 2026 with stronger global brand momentum, and a broader product expansion opportunity than at any point in our history. While the consumer environment continues to be in debate, the fundamentals of our strategy remain sound, giving us conviction in our long-term opportunity. For 2026, we expect 6% to 8% net sales growth shaped by strength in our innovation pipeline and our brand, and expanding global reach. Over the long term, we continue to see the path toward high single digit to low double digit growth. We remain grounded in the same strategic growth priorities that have guided us through the past few years: driving product innovation, broadening our brand and addressable market, expanding our global presence. These pillars position us well as we enter 2026 with a higher capacity innovation engine, solid global demand signals, and a more diversified growth model. Product innovation anchored in durability, performance, and design remains the foundation of our long-term growth strategy. The portfolio is built on the strength of our two foundational categories, Drinkware and Coolers & Equipment, and 13 unique and scalable product platforms. Importantly, we entered 2026 with one of our strongest pipelines in years, Thailand, and Vietnam, supported by innovation teams across Austin, Bozeman, Denver, enabling a robust global innovation cycle allowing us to prototype faster, expand categories more efficiently, and bring a global scale to product development. Turning to Drinkware. We delivered 6% global growth in Q4, bolstered by innovation and expansion offsetting category cleanup discussed throughout 2025. While certain trend-driven styles in the category remained highly promotional, our broadening product platforms drove the business, and we entered 2026 with a refreshed assortment, stronger global traction, and clear line of sight to continued growth. In 2025, we further broadened our definition of the Drinkware category. Today, we innovate across four platforms: bottles and jugs; cups, mugs, and tumblers; tableware, coffeeware, barware, and containers; and finally, cookware. Let me share a few examples of recent expansion. We launched the Silo 40-ounce and half-gallon jugs built for the job site and the sidelines, broadened our health and wellness assortment with the Yonder shaker bottles, added new high-capacity leakproof products with travel straw mugs, expanded color and personalization capabilities including collegiate, NFL, and team-inspired designs, and recently extended our premium ceramic line formats in Drinkware. We also advanced our lineup through early limited release carbon steel cookware and grew our offering in vacuum sealed food jars and bowls. We have additional innovation waves planned for 2026, supporting the acceleration we expect during the year. These initiatives create broader uses for consumers, expanding our addressable market beyond traditional drinkware. Demand in Coolers & Equipment remains exceptionally healthy, with strong sell-through across DayTrip soft cooler bags and Camino totes. Camino continued to broaden consumer reach, while DayTrip remained a standout performer in soft cooler bags. In hard coolers, we lapped a tough comparison with the very successful 2024 innovation in key product transition from a year ago. Overall, hard coolers continue to be a core product platform with particular consumer demand for high per",

The revised target indicates an upside of over 44% from the current levels. On the same day, YPF Sociedad Anónima (NYSE:YPF) signed a joint development agreement with Italian Eni and UAE-based XRG to advance Argentina LNG, a large-scale integrated gas and liquefaction project that will help position the South American country as a long-term global LNG supplier. The project, expected to deliver 12 million tons per annum (tpa) of LNG capacity via two floating facilities, is designed to include production, processing, transportation, and LNG export infrastructure. Under the agreement, the three partners will start front-end engineering and design and perform other key technical, commercial, and financing workstreams.

Matador Resources (MTDR) Downgraded to 'Equal Weight' Matador Resources Company (NYSE:MTDR) is an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development, production, and acquisition of oil and natural gas resources in the United States, with an emphasis on shale and other unconventional plays. Matador Resources Company (NYSE:MTDR) had a setback on January 27 when Wells Fargo downgraded the stock from ‘Overweight’ to ‘Equal Weight’, while also trimming its price target from $71 to $47. The analyst believes that MTDR’s valuation ‘increasingly incorporates a range of structural considerations’, including higher capital intensity, variability in recent productivity trends, and a growth‑oriented strategy in a market that favors discipline. Wells Fargo noted that while the energy company’s progress on capital efficiency or midstream monetization could help improve investor sentiment, the stock offers a more balanced risk/reward at current levels compared to industry peers. Similarly, earlier on January 23, Morgan Stanley analyst Devin McDermott also reduced the firm’s price target on Matador Resources Company (NYSE:MTDR) from $56 to $52, but maintained its ‘Equal Weight’ rating on the shares.

      "content": "Friday Could Be a Big Day for Markets Matthew Benjamin, The Motley Fool Thu, February 19, 2026 at 10:13 AM CST 3 min read NVDA INTC This Friday could see some significant movement in U.S. financial markets. That's because on Friday morning, Feb. 20, at 8:30 a.m. ET, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) will publish the Fed's preferred measure of inflation , the Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index. It's a data point well worth monitoring, because the Federal Reserve will be watching it extremely closely. It could set the tone for monetary policy for the rest of 2026, and it could move markets. Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » Image source: Getty Images. While many investors pay more attention to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and it tends to get more media attention, the Fed actually prefers the PCE Price Index. According to the Cleveland Fed, that's because \"the PCE price index offers a broader and more comprehensive measure of inflation and more quickly picks up adjustments in consumers' choices in response to price changes.\" For those reasons, the Fed's 2% target for the annual inflation rate is based on the PCE Price Index, not the CPI. One recent measure of inflation says it's moderating The CPI is still important. Last Friday, we got a better-than-expected reading from that inflation measure. Consumer prices rose 2.4% (on an annual basis) in January, while economists had expected them to rise 2.5% over a year ago. Taking out volatile food and energy prices, the Consumer Price Index was up 2.5%, the lowest level since April 2021. The market opened higher that day due to the CPI data. If the PCE Price Index confirms that inflation has moderated in recent months, which many analysts expect, it would confirm the CPI report. That would mean that after many months of remaining stubbornly above the Fed's target level, inflation is finally starting to move down again toward it. That would give the Fed leeway to make additional cuts to its benchmark interest rate this year. Right now, the futures market is pricing in two quarter-percentage point cuts in 2026. But it's slowly moving toward three cuts, due to last Friday's CPI report and comments from some Fed officials that additional rate cuts are increasingly possible this year. In fact, this week, Austan Goolsbee, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said there may be potential for additional rate cuts this year. Lower rates -- or just the possibility of them -- would be a big shot in the arm for the stock market . Expectations of easier borrowing create optimism that companies will be able to both cut their interest expenses and borrow more to grow, while more favorable financing for consumers should boost their spending. Story Continues So watch the PCE Price Index on Friday, about an hour before market open. It could tell you which way the market will go that day.

On January 27, Wells Fargo analyst Hanwen Chang slightly raised the firm’s price target on Permian Resources Corporation (NYSE:PR) from $16 to $17, while keeping an ‘Overweight’ rating on the shares. The analyst highlighted that the macro oil environment remains pressured by surging output from OPEC and non-OPEC producers, pointing to a near-term supply glut that is weighing on prices. Amid the difficult outlook, Wells Fargo prefers frameworks with low reinvestment and strong capital discipline. On the other hand, earlier on January 26, Susquehanna reduced its price target on Permian Resources Corporation (NYSE:PR) from $20 to $18, but kept its ‘Positive’ rating on the stock. The revision, which still indicates an upside of over 6% from the current share price, comes as the analyst firm updated its targets in the E&P group as part of a Q4 preview.

SM Energy (SM) Completes Merger with Civitas Resources SM Energy Company (NYSE:SM) is an independent energy company focused on the exploration, exploitation, development, acquisition, and production of natural gas and crude oil in the United States. SM Energy Company (NYSE:SM) announced on January 30 that it had closed its all-stock merger with Civitas Resources, creating a larger independent producer that will continue to trade under the SM Energy name. First announced in November 2025, the deal is valued at around $12.8 billion, including debt. Following the merger, SM shareholders now hold 48% of the combined company, with the remaining 52% going to Civitas shareholders. The merged firm will hold about 823,000 net acres across the top U.S. shale basins, including Permian and Denver-Julesburg. The transaction is expected to save SM Energy Company (NYSE:SM) between $200 million and $300 million annually by reducing overhead and operating costs. According to S&P Global, the merger is expected to help SM Energy Company (NYSE:SM) grow its total output by 133% YoY to 484,000 boepd in FY 2026, with production in the Permian Basin alone projected to jump by 186% YoY. The firm expects SM’s total revenue to more than double in 2026, rising 103% YoY to around $6.5 billion. Beth McDonald, President and CEO of SM Energy Company (NYSE:SM), commented: “Today’s close marks the start of our work together as one SM, a top 10 U.S. independent oil-focused producer, with a larger, complementary footprint across the highest‑return U.S. shale basins—including a premier Permian position. We are focused on effectively integrating the two companies to unlock additional free cash flow by achieving our previously announced annual synergy target of $200 to $300 million and executing our previously announced divestiture target of at least $1.0 billion over the next year. We expect these steps to further strengthen our balance sheet, accelerate our return of capital to stockholders, and drive considerable upside in our equity. We look forward to sharing our 2026 operating plan and our updated return of capital framework on our upcoming conference call in late February.” While we acknowledge the potential of SM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

(NYSE: OVV ) is included among the 12 Best Crude Oil Stocks to Buy as Tensions Rise . Ovintiv (OVV) Initiated with 'Equal Weight' Rating, $44 Price Target Ovintiv Inc. (NYSE:OVV), a leading North American exploration and production company focused on developing its high-quality, multi-basin portfolio. On February 3, Stephens initiated coverage of Ovintiv Inc. (NYSE:OVV) with an ‘Equal Weight’ rating and a price target of $44. The analyst believes that despite its ‘operational prowess’, the stock is attractively valued, with an estimated 2026 EV/EBITDA ratio of 3.6x, 30% below the large-cap oil peer group average of 5.1x. Stephens highlighted that Ovintiv Inc. (NYSE:OVV)’s divestment of Anadarko Basin assets could make the company around $3.5 billion. This will allow the E&P firm to bolster its balance sheet, reduce net debt by over 65% this year, and increase shareholder returns. Also on February 3, Ovintiv Inc. (NYSE:OVV) announced it had closed its previously announced acquisition of NuVista Energy, valued at $2.7 billion. The strategic move is expected to add around 930 net 10,000-foot equivalent well locations and approximately 140,000 net acres in the core of the oil-rich Alberta Montney. The company expects the acquired assets to produce an average of approximately 100 mboe/d in FY 2026. Brendan McCracken, President and CEO of Ovintiv Inc. (NYSE:OVV), commented: “These top decile rate of return assets in the heart of the Montney oil window are an exceptional fit with our existing acreage and infrastructure. The team at NuVista did a great job building these assets and we are excited to apply our industry-leading expertise to the combined position. We expect to generate cost synergies of approximately $100 million annually, including per well cost savings of approximately $1 million, consistent with our current Montney well costs.” McCracken continued, “The combination of this transaction with the planned divestiture of our Anadarko assets, will streamline and high-grade our portfolio, help us to meet or exceed our debt target, and uniquely position us with significant inventory duration in the two most valuable oil plays in North America, the Permian and the Montney.” While we acknowledge the potential of OVV as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "content": "3 Medicare Mistakes That Could Increase Your Healthcare Bills in Retirement Maurie Backman, The Motley Fool Thu, February 19, 2026 at 10:06 AM CST 4 min read While some of your expenses may decrease in retirement, your healthcare costs may inevitably go up. That could come as a result of aging or losing an employer health insurance plan that had fantastic benefits. The good news is that there are steps you can take to lower your healthcare bills as a Medicare enrollee. But if that's your goal, it's important to avoid these three mistakes. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks » Image source: Getty Images. 1. Signing up late You might think that a late Medicare enrollment is no big deal. In reality, it could cost you money for the rest of your life. Your initial Medicare enrollment window is seven months long, giving most people ample time to sign up before having to worry about surcharges. That period starts three months before the month of your 65th birthday, and it ends three months after that month. If you don't sign up for Medicare when you're first eligible, rest assured that you'll have opportunities to enroll in the future. But you may not get to control the timing of your enrollment if you miss your initial window, since you'll then typically be limited to Medicare's general enrollment period, which runs from Jan. 1 through March 31 every year. Meanwhile, signing up late for Medicare could result in a 10% surcharge on your Part B premiums for each 12-month period you were eligible for coverage but didn't enroll. And that surcharge doesn't go away -- ever. So if you want to avoid it, pay attention to when you're supposed to enroll in Medicare initially and make that happen. 2. Choosing the wrong coverage Once you're eligible for Medicare, you can choose your specific coverage. That could mean sticking with original Medicare and adding a Part D drug plan. Or, it could mean getting an all-in-one Medicare Advantage plan . It's important to choose the coverage that's best for your situation, and to review your plan choices each year during Medicare's fall open enrollment period. Selecting the wrong plan could leave you with higher costs. When comparing plan options, be sure to look at factors such as: Monthly premium costs Deductibles Maximum out-of-pocket limits (which don't apply to original Medicare but do apply to Medicare Advantage plans) 3. Not buying Medigap right away If you sign up for a Medicare Advantage plan, you'll have a maximum out-of-pocket limit you're responsible for each year. But if you stick with original Medicare, there's no limit to your out-of-pocket spending. Story Continues That's why it's important to buy Medigap coverage, which is supplemental insurance that could pick up the tab for costs like deductibles and coinsurance. And your initial window to do so lasts six months and starts the first day of the month in which you're 65 and enrolled in Medicare Part B. If you don't buy Medigap during that initial six-month window, a couple of things might happen. First, going without supplemental insurance could leave you grappling with very expensive bills. Secondly, buying Medigap beyond your initial enrollment window could leave you paying more for it, since at that point, you'll be subject to underwriting and insurers can charge you more based on your health. The less you have to spend on healthcare in retirement, the more money you'll have to enjoy your life. Do your best to avoid these Medicare mistakes that could drive your healthcare bills through the roof.

(NASDAQ:VNOM) is a publicly traded Delaware corporation focused on owning and acquiring mineral and royalty interests, primarily in the Permian Basin. On January 23, Morgan Stanley analyst Devin McDermott slightly lowered the firm’s price target on Viper Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:VNOM) from $45 to $44, while maintaining an ‘Overweight’ rating on the shares. The revision comes as the analyst firm marked its 2026-27 oil price forecast in conjunction with its Q4 preview for E&Ps, oil majors, and Canadian producers. While the firm expects ‘fairly clean’ operational updates in Q4, it is forecasting lower cash flow from price realizations. Similarly, earlier on January 21, Barclays analyst Betty Jiang also reduced the firm’s price target on Viper Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:VNOM) from $60 to $54, but kept its ‘Overweight’ rating on the shares. The adjustment comes as Barclays updated its ratings and targets in the E&P sector as part of a Q4 preview. The analyst firm believes that the upstream sector’s cash return model ‘remains resilient’ amid the overall volatility and sees attractive investment opportunities in the US onshore. Viper Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:VNOM) is set to announce its Q4 2025 results on February 23. While we acknowledge the potential of VNOM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Caitlyn Moorhead Thu, February 19, 2026 at 10:06 AM CST 6 min read SelectStock / Getty Images/Vetta If you feel like the tax man is chasing you, you may be able to lose him if you are exempt from federal tax withholding. However, figuring out your status and allowances can get a little confusing, especially when tax season rolls around and questions about refunds come up. Many workers notice little or no federal income tax taken out of their paychecks and wonder if they are exempt, or better yet, if they’ll get a refund. Don’t count your chickens just yet, as the answer depends on several factors, including your income, filing status, tax credits and how you completed your Form W-4. So, what does it really mean to be exempt from federal withholding? Who qualifies, and can you still receive a tax refund ? Here is a guide to help you file with confidence and avoid costly mistakes. How Do I Know If I Am Exempt From Federal Withholding? Form W-4 is an IRS tax form completed by an employee to indicate their current tax situation. You usually complete a Form W-4 when you start a new job or your financial situation changes. This form helps you estimate your total income and the total amount of your deductions and certain tax credits to let your employer know how much federal income tax to withhold from each paycheck. You are exempt from federal income tax withholding in 2026 if you had no federal income tax liability in 2025 and expect none in 2026, meaning your total tax is zero. However, you can still get a refund if you qualify for refundable credits, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit or others, when you file your return. Keep in mind that exempt status must be renewed annually, and was due Feb. 15. Check Out: Here’s How Much Your State Collects on Every Type of Tax For You: 9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week) If you cannot claim exemption from withholding, you can still reduce the amount withheld from every paycheck by entering the dollar amount of your deductions and claiming your dependents and dependent-related tax credits on Form W-4 . As you add deductions and credits, your tax withholding will decrease and your take-home pay will increase. When you claim fewer deductions and credits, your tax withholding increases and you see less in your paycheck. This is often a delicate balance. You don’t want to claim too many adjustments to your income, as your employer will not withhold enough tax based on your filing status. This could leave you with a big tax bill come April. Yet, not claiming all the adjustments you’re entitled to means you’ll have to wait for your tax refund to get your overpayment back. Story Continues What Does It Mean To Be Exempt From Federal Withholding? Being exempt from federal withholding means your employer will not withhold federal income tax from your paycheck. When you claim certain deductions, they get subtracted from your annual gross income. This causes your taxable income to decrease as well. For the 2025 tax year, the IRS has increased the standard deduction amounts due to inflation . Key amounts include $31,500 for married filing jointly, $23,625 for heads of household, and $15,750 for single filers or married individuals filing separately. These higher deductions are part of inflation adjustments for taxes filed in 2026. Who Is Exempt From Federal Income Tax? Simply put, if you earn less than the standard deduction or receive government assistance with your living expenses, you might be able to claim an exemption. Unsurprisingly, most of these exceptions are based on income level, and typically, people with lower income are the ones who qualify for the exemption from federal income tax. Here are a few key notes and examples: Student: You are not automatically exempt as a student. If you are a seasonal or part-time worker, you may qualify for this exemption. Age 65 or older: If Social Security is your only source of income, then you do not need to file a tax return. Social Security is not included in gross income. Fun fact: The IRS considers you age 65 the day before your actual birthday. Visually impaired: Due to the cost of living, there is a higher standard deduction for those who are blind. This includes individuals who cannot see 20/200 with glasses or contacts or whose field of vision is 20 degrees or less. If you are a low-income filer, you may be eligible for various tax credits and deductions. However, keep in mind that this exemption does not apply to Social Security or Medicare tax. It’s also important to note that exemptions expire every year. If you claim an exemption but your situation changes at a later time, you must file a new Form W-4 within 10 days after the change. This exemption is only good for one year, and you must file by Feb. 15 of each year to continue your exemption. Do You Still Get a Refund If You’re Exempt From Federal Withholding? Being exempt from withholding doesn’t necessarily mean you won’t receive a refund, but it does change how and when taxes are paid to the IRS. In some cases, taxpayers qualify for an exemption because they owe no federal income tax, while in others, insufficient withholding can lead to surprises at tax time. Taxpayers really don’t love having to figure this out, nor do they like any confusion when it comes to filing taxes, but the anticipation of a large refund is always a nice reward. The IRS will issue tax refunds when you have overpaid. You receive this money only because you have paid more than what you owe. When you file for an exemption from withholding, you are not making any tax payments throughout the year. Since you are not paying any taxes, you typically will not qualify for a tax refund. However, there are exceptions. For example, you could potentially still obtain a refund if you qualify to claim a refundable tax credit, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. This benefits low- to moderate-income people and reduces the amount of taxes you owe. With tax season in full swing, it’s important to stay informed when it comes to tax withholding. If you are unsure whether you qualify for an exemption or a tax credit, visit the IRS website for more details or contact a professional accountant.

Figma ( FIG ) stock rose 6% on Thursday, reversing a 30% year-to-date decline after the cloud-based design software company noted a record number of new customers in 2025, with accelerating revenue and product development. \"Our growth and momentum show that our strategy is working,\" Figma CEO Dylan Field said during the company's earnings call. \"As AI gets better, Figma gets better.\" The company reported that Figma Make, its AI-powered tool for creating web apps and interfaces using natural language rather than traditional code, saw weekly active users rise more than 70% quarter over quarter, while attracting new audiences and use cases. More from Yahoo Scout What's Wall Street's view on AI impact opportunities? How are companies defending against AI disruption fears? Why did logistics stocks face AI-related sell-offs? What drove Figma's stock recovery amid AI concerns? The sell-off over fears of AI disruption has also impacted logistics stocks. C.H. Robinson ( CHRW ) and Universal Logistics ( ULH ) sank as much as double-digit percentages in one day last week. The culprit: a small Florida-based company announced an AI platform that can scale freight volumes by 300% to 400% and reduce empty trucking miles by 70%. Shares of C.H. Robinson, which hit all-time highs earlier this month, have partially bounced back this week. \"We're just not going to let a moment of uncertainty really blur the difference between what is perception and reality,\" C.H. Robinson CEO Dave Bozeman said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid on Wednesday. \"And the reality is this: We are the disrupter and not the disrupted,\" he added, as the company has been leading in AI integration. Specialist Patrick King, left, and trader Robert Charmak work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Feb. 19. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) · ASSOCIATED PRESS Wall Street analysts are pushing back against the knee-jerk reaction across other sectors hit by the \"AI scare trade.\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives pointed to buying opportunities in the cybersecurity sector, including CrowdStrike ( CRWD ), Palo Alto Networks ( PANW ), and Zscaler ( ZS ), down 7%, 16, and 22% year to date, respectively. \"AI will be a major tailwind to the cyber security sector over the coming years as protection of use cases, data, and end points expand markedly,\" Ives wrote in a note on Tuesday. Bernstein analysts also said that for most engineers, coding is barely a sixth of all activities performed. \"In our view, the recent de-rating of AI-exposed or AI-adjacent sectors within technology may be somewhat overdone,\" Bernstein analyst Venugopal Garre and his team wrote. Story Continues \"Over time, AI is likely to be absorbed into the toolbox of enterprise technology rather than replacing it entirely,\" Garre added.

Rob Isbitts Thu, February 19, 2026 at 12:26 PM CST 4 min read BTC-USD IBIT As a technician to the core, I can’t help but look at the below chart and think to myself, “That’s one way to be a store of value.” Ishares Bitcoin Trust ETF's (IBIT) price is flat over two years. But yes, I’m burying the lead there. Lots of gyrations to get to zero returns over that time. My assessment of this daily chart is simple. This might be Bitcoin’s (BTCUSD) last stand, in that if its price gets buried at the next level down ($30? Below $30?), it could take a long time to recover.

Subscribe today! If at all. By the way, that’s about 20% down from here. Or in Bitcoin price terms, about $53,000. www.barchart.com After a few decades in and around financial markets, and making more investment decisions than I could ever remember, I’ve developed several features of modern markets that I refer to as “facts of life.” Among them is this: Popular assets, be they stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or other assets, don’t always just go away. They hang around, often for decades, as once uber-popular places for traders and investors to partake in. But essentially, they are demoted to forgotten tickers, if you will. I cannot say with any certainty that Bitcoin will be one of those. But if it doesn't get its act together soon, it could risk being one of the more notable “facts of life” victims I can recall. I’ve lived and invested through: Dot-com stocks Underground cable stocks Collaterized debt obligations (CDOs) Junk bonds — when they really were junk Special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) 3D-printing stocks( and at least 1 ETF) One day, I wonder if ETFs like IBIT and its many peers will adorn that historical list. Not to mention other crypto products. Because as I see it, the debate surrounding Bitcoin has shifted from, \"Will it survive?\" to \"What is its actual purpose?” This, in a world where digital finance is becoming the norm. As the original cryptocurrency faces a stagnant price range and mounting competition from traditional assets, the narrative is split between those seeing a final exit and those seeing a structural evolution. The Case for the Last Stand There is a slow trickle of evidence that the basic pillars supporting the Bitcoin-to-the-moon narrative are beginning to crumble under the weight of a changing global economy. Bitcoin was long touted as the ultimate hedge against inflation and a falling dollar. But during the recent bouts of global inflation, Bitcoin often behaved more like a high-risk tech stock than some sort of digital gold. When the Nasdaq 100 fell, Bitcoin fell in sympathy, even as interest rates rose. Story Continues In addition, governments across the globe have transitioned from ignoring crypto to aggressively regulating it. The introduction of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and stricter anti-money-laundering rules has stripped away some of that very outsider appeal that originally drove Bitcoin's adoption. And, now more than 15 years into its life, Bitcoin is still rarely used for everyday transactions. To be clear, I do not have a horse in this race, so to speak. I’ve done nicely just “renting” crypto ETFs and options on them the past couple of years to try to catch up and down waves. And boy, have there been a lot of both!  Still, the lack of a real-world use case beyond speculation suggests that the market may finally be running out of new buyers to keep the price afloat. The Case for a New Chapter But as others will argue, perhaps Bitcoin isn't dying. Maybe it is simply maturing into a boring, reliable institutional asset. The launch of spot ETFs and the inclusion of Bitcoin in corporate treasuries have created a structural floor for the price. Major financial institutions are no longer debating its existence; they are building the plumbing to offer it to every retirement account in America. And, while its correlation with tech is high, some investors still view Bitcoin as a lifeboat-like asset in regions with failing currencies or unstable banking systems. In this view, Bitcoin doesn't need to be a currency; it just needs to be a portable, un-hackable vault. What I’m Watching: The ETFs The line in the sand for Bitcoin is institutional flow. If the daily inflows into Bitcoin ETFs begin to turn into sustained outflows, it will signal that the market has lost interest in the digital gold narrative, and the other positive cases for long-term holding of crypto in public market-traded form. I imagine somewhere they still trade 3D-printing stocks “in size.” But after all the fuss about Bitcoin ETFs coming to market, and the deluge of demand we saw for a while, this would likely be the biggest case of a “fact of life” asset going down I can recall.

      "content": "Readers sound off: Rising medical bills are devouring Social Security checks Kerry Hannon · Senior Columnist Thu, February 19, 2026 at 12:28 PM CST 6 min read The drubbing that monthly Social Security benefits take from out-of-pocket medical costs shocks many retirees. My recent column highlighting how healthcare costs are eating into Social Security checks hit a nerve. Thousands of you shared how you’re grappling with the reality: that even including Medicare coverage and not accounting for long-term care, retirees are overwhelmed by premiums, copays, and a myriad of uncovered medical services. More from Yahoo Scout What are the long-term care costs for seniors? Why doesn't Medicare provide free healthcare for retirees? How much do healthcare costs impact Social Security benefits? How does the COLA formula affect retirees' expenses? These expenses make up roughly a third of a typical retiree’s Social Security income and almost a quarter of total income, according to a new report from the Center for Retirement at Boston College. The following is an edited sample of some of your comments and my take on them. Feel free to chime in, of course, in the comments section at the end of this follow-up. Free healthcare is a 'myth' of Medicare My wife and I have Medicare and have generally good health. We still spend about $11,000 a year for healthcare services, (mostly for eyeglasses, hearing aids, and dental), and premiums for Part B and Part B Supplements. It is a myth that once you hit 65, Medicare provides \"free healthcare.\" Along those lines: My wife and I, in retirement, spend over $1,000/month, which is approximately 25% of our Social Security income, for Medicare Part B, supplements, and deductibles. It is by far our largest annual expense. Another reader added: Between my wife and I, our health insurance premiums consume our ENTIRE Social Security checks put together. We are just glad it COVERS it, so far that is. Luckily SS is not our only source of income or we'd be toast. One more piles on: Retired and on Social Security and Medicare for 11 years now. 2026 is the first year that my dollar income (Social Security minus Medicare & Supplement) has gone DOWN. Kerry: That squeeze means people are skipping medical care. More than half of America’s 55.8 million seniors have gone without at least one healthcare product or service to cut costs in the last 12 months, according to research from the Senior Citizens League. What are they skipping? Dental care, vision, and hearing. It’s the COLA formula, stupid Clearly, the COLA (cost-of-living) adjustment is neither accurate nor realistic if it is not keeping up with healthcare costs of retirees. Another commenter added: The cost-of-living index used does NOT track the specific products/services that retired folks experience!! In particular, a retired person's medical expenses are a much higher percentage of our yearly expenses, and these are not reflected in the currently used index. Kerry: I agree there is a major disconnect. Story Continues The COLA is calculated by averaging inflation data for the third quarter of the year — July, August, and September — and then comparing that figure with the same data from the previous year based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W). The Consumer Price Index for the Elderly (CPI-E) — the alternative index for Americans age 62 and older — weighs healthcare costs more heavily than the CPI-W. “The reality is most older Americans constantly tell us they believe the CPI-W, the measure used to calculate the COLA, underestimates inflation as they see it,” Shannon Benton, executive director of the Senior Citizens League, told Yahoo Finance. The CPI-E is designed to reflect seniors’ budgets and tends to come in slightly higher than the CPI-W, which tracks inflation for people who work and live in cities, she said. “Multiple bills have been introduced in Congress over the years to change the COLA calculation to the CPI-E, “but they keep getting bogged down in gridlock,” per Benton. The devil is in the details You have to really scrutinize charges and fees. My GP ordered a couple preventive care screenings that are 100% covered by Medicare Part B. The hospital called me to schedule, and I subsequently received an email with a copay notification. I called the hospital billing department to get an explanation. It turns out the scheduler put in the wrong diagnostic codes, so a copay was required. Once the correct codes were put in, I received a follow-up email with a zero copay and zero balance notice. If you don't ask, you may be paying for something you shouldn't. Kerry: I personally had this happen when I was caring for my 90-year-old mother and she had an emergency room visit after a fall. When the bill arrived, I was stunned, having expected her Medicare coverage and supplemental policy to pay for her care. After a slew of phone calls and emails the hospital’s billing department administrator discovered that the wrong codes for mom’s care had been used, and we were off the hook for the nearly five-figure amount. It was a time-consuming hassle to push back, but I suspect many people get swallowed under medical debt because they accept the bill at face value. The more you earn, the more you pay My wife and I maxed out our 401(k) and 403(b) plans over our working years. I simply wasn’t fully aware of the impact that Social Security, pensions, and 401(k) withdrawals would have on our Medicare premiums and the income-related adjustment. For doing the right thing by saving for retirement, we’re penalized. Kerry: This is one that bites. Since 2007, a beneficiary’s Part B monthly premium is based on his or her income. About 8% of Medicare users earn too much to qualify for the standard Part B and Part D premiums and must pay surcharges, known as Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amounts (IRMAA). Details can be found on this fact sheet . The surcharge is calculated on a sliding scale with five income brackets topping out at $500,000 and $750,000 for individual and joint filing, respectively. These figures change annually with inflation. For 2026, these inflation-adjusted brackets start at above $109,000 for single tax filers and over $218,000 for joint filers. For these beneficiaries, total monthly Part B premiums range from $284.10 to $689.90. Part D surcharges range from $14.50 to $91.00. Have a question about retirement? Personal finances?

Kerry: Numerous readers complained about the out-of-pocket cost of assisted care. The sticker shock is real. An apartment in an assisted-living facility averaged $82,899 a year in 2025, up from $74,148 in 2024, according to the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care — and costs go up as care needs increase. Units for dementia patients can run more than $100,000. “About 80% of those ages 65 and over will require some long-term care, with nearly 20% requiring high-intensity care for more than three years,” said Anqi Chen, associate director of savings and household finance at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. There are long-term care insurance policies you can purchase to cover some of these costs, but they are expensive and get more so as you age. Most older Americans don’t realize that Medicare will not cover the costs of these facilities if their illness is long-term, and few have money set aside to pay for future living assistance expenses.

Honeywell (HON) returned 23.1%. Chevron (CVX) gained 19.1%. Overall, the Consumer Staples ETF (XLP) is up 13.3% as investors flee to industries that are perceived as ‘safe’ from AI disruption. Verizon closed its Frontier acquisition in January 2026 and expanded fiber reach to over 30 million homes. Verizon projects free cash flow exceeding $21.5B for 2026. Honeywell is splitting into automation and aerospace units. A recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here . Retirees watching their portfolios in early 2026 have reason to smile. While tech stocks stumble, dividend stalwarts are delivering steady cash flow and capital appreciation. Consumer Staples (XLP) is up 13.3% year-to-date, while Technology (XLK) has dropped 2.1%. In a year when growth stocks are catching their breath, dividend payers are sprinting ahead. We ranked three Dow components retirees love based on year-to-date performance, dividend reliability, and cash generation. These are blue-chip businesses with decades of dividend increases, fortress balance sheets, and predictable income streams. Here's how they stack up as of February 18, 2026. #3: Honeywell International Honeywell International ( NASDAQ:HON ) is up 23.1% year-to-date, the strongest gain of the three. It lands at #3 because restructuring uncertainty makes it the riskiest choice for retirees. Honeywell is splitting into separate automation and aerospace businesses, a transformation that could unlock value but introduces near-term complexity. The company beat Q4 earnings with adjusted EPS of $2.59 versus the $2.54 estimate, though revenue of $9.76 billion missed the $9.87 billion consensus. Free cash flow surged 33% year-over-year to $2.51 billion, and orders jumped 23% organically. CEO Vimal Kapur noted: \"We concluded 2025 with strong results that exceeded the high end of our guidance for adjusted sales and adjusted EPS.\" Honeywell has raised its dividend for 23 consecutive years, with the 2025 annual payout reaching $4.58 per share, up 4.8% from 2024's $4.37. At a current yield of 1.9%, it's the lowest yielder of the three, but 574% dividend growth since 1999 shows long-term compounding power. The forward P/E of 23x reflects restructuring optimism. The spin-off of business units is expected to complete over the coming quarters, adding complexity to the near-term outlook. #2: Chevron Corporation Chevron Corporation ( NYSE:CVX ) has delivered a 19.1% year-to-date return while pumping out industry-leading cash flow. The oil giant beat Q4 earnings with $1.52 per share versus the $1.44 estimate, and revenue of $46.87 billion topped $46.7 billion consensus estimates. Lower crude prices pressured profits, but free cash flow climbed 26% year-over-year to $5.5 billion. Story Continues CEO Mike Wirth summed up the year: \"2025 was a year of significant achievement. We successfully integrated Hess, started-up major projects, delivered record production...industry-leading free cash flow growth and superior shareholder returns, despite declining oil prices.\" Worldwide production jumped 12% year-over-year. Chevron raised its quarterly dividend 4% to $1.78 per share in January 2026, marking decades of uninterrupted increases. At a 3.8% yield, it offers meaningful income without distress-signal levels. Chevron returned $12.1 billion via buybacks in 2025. The risk: oil prices remain volatile, and Chevron's fortunes are tied to commodity markets. #1: Verizon Communications Verizon Communications ( NYSE:VZ ) takes the top spot with a 20.6% year-to-date gain and the highest yield at 5.9%. Verizon has raised its dividend for 19 consecutive years, with the current quarterly payout of $0.7075 per share, up from $0.6775 in early 2025. Q4 results showed transformation in action. Verizon beat earnings with $1.09 per share in adjusted EPS. The headline: free cash flow exploded 285% year-over-year to $20.13 billion, driven by the Frontier acquisition that closed January 20, 2026. That deal expanded Verizon's fiber footprint to over 30 million homes and businesses. The company added over 1 million total net customers in Q4, its strongest quarterly performance since 2019. CEO Dan Schulman was direct: \"Verizon will no longer be a hunting ground for our competitors. The closing of our Frontier acquisition on January 20 is another pivotal step in our turnaround.\" For 2026, management projects adjusted EPS growth of 4% to 5% and free cash flow exceeding $21.5 billion. At a forward P/E of 10x, Verizon trades like a value stock with a growth catalyst. How the Three Compare Among the three, Honeywell posted the highest capital appreciation year-to-date but is navigating a restructuring. Chevron generated strong cash flow while managing commodity price exposure. Verizon reported the highest yield at 5.9% and closed its Frontier acquisition in January 2026, projecting free cash flow exceeding $21.5 billion for the year. Data Shows One Habit Doubles American’s Savings And Boosts Retirement Most Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t. And no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it’s shocking more people don’t adopt the habit given how easy it is . Terms and Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices More Info",

      "content": "Cenovus Energy Q4 Earnings Skyrocket on Record Production Michael Kern Thu, February 19, 2026 at 12:30 PM CST 2 min read CVE CL=F MEG.TO Cenovus Energy on Thursday reported a surge in fourth-quarter net earnings from a year earlier as its upstream production rose by 5% on the year to hit a record high. Cenovus Energy’s net earnings jumped to US$683 million (C$934 million) for the fourth quarter, up from US$107 million (C$146 million) for the same period of 2024. More from Yahoo Scout What are Cenovus's 2026 production growth expectations? What role did Trans Mountain expansion play? How did the MEG Energy acquisition impact performance? What drove Cenovus Energy's record quarterly earnings surge? The fourth-quarter operating results included record upstream production of 917,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), and downstream crude throughput of 465,500 barrels per day (bpd), representing an overall utilization rate of 98%. Moreover, upstream production ended the year at a monthly record rate of over 970,000 boe/d in December. The record upstream production for Q4 excludes the impact of production associated with Cenovus Energy’s acquisition of MEG Energy Corp. Following months of one of the most protracted bidding wars, Cenovus Energy finally completed the MEG acquisition at the end of 2025. The acquisition of MEG in the fourth quarter allowed Cenovus to materially progress integration and initial synergy capture initiatives. Cenovus continues to expect to deliver US$110 million (C$150 million) of annual synergies in 2026 and 2027, growing to over US$292 million (C$400 million) annually in 2028 and beyond. In the 2026 capital budget and corporate guidance released in December, Cenovus expects its upstream production to rise by about 4% in 2026 compared to 2025 as it is completing new projects and adding assets of MEG Energy. The Canadian energy major sees its upstream production at between 945,000 boe/d and 985,000 boe/d this year, a rise of about 4% compared to 2025, adjusted for the acquisition of MEG Energy Corp. Cenovus Energy and other Canadian oil and gas producers have boosted their production as the expanded Trans Mountain route has been offering increased takeaway capacity over the past year and a half. Production in the key oil province of Alberta hit a new record-high in 2025, with average daily production up by 166,000 bpd, or 4.2%, compared to 2024. TMX, whose nameplate capacity was tripled to 890,000 bpd from 300,000 bpd, was the key driver of Alberta’s record oil production while enabling more oil exports from Alberta to Asia.

The June 18 $50 call had the second-highest Vol/OI ratio yesterday, trailing only Figs’ March 20 $12.50 call with a Vol/OI ratio of 221.01. Cogent’s June 18 $35 call was the seventh-highest at 61.74. I’ve got 21,000 reasons why these two unusually active call options scream Bull Call Spread. Why 21,000 Reasons? If you think I’m going to rhyme off 21,000 actual reasons for the bull call spread, you’ve come to the wrong place. Not even options are that complicated. No, the 21,000 comes from two multi-leg trades yesterday that accounted for most of Cogent’s volume on the day. As I said earlier, Cogent’s volume yesterday was 68,987. These five trades accounted for 90% of it. As you can see, four of the five trades were for June 18 calls. You’ve got 5,000 each for the $35 and $50 strikes, and 16,000 each for the $35 and $50 strikes. That’s 21,000. Is the $35/$50 Combination the Best Bull Call Spread Bet? Here are the various combinations based on going long the $35 call and short the $50 call, and four other strike prices, as I am writing this early in Thursday trading. In case you’re new to options, the bull call spread involves buying a call option at one price and selling a call option at a higher strike price for premium income to lower the overall cost of the trade, where both have the same expiration date. Weiterlesen You’re bullish on its future stock price. It's attractive to risk-averse investors because both the profit and loss are defined before the trade is made and capped, limiting the risk/reward proposition. So, using the $35/$50 combination to start, the trade costs $2.75, or $275 [$3.50 ask price - $0.75 bid price], or 9..9% of the share price. Under 10% is always a good bet. This is called your net debit and is your maximum loss. It happens if the share price is below $35 at expiration on June 18. The maximum profit on this combination is $12.25 ($1,225), which is the difference in strike values minus the net debit [$50 strike - $35 strike - $2.75]. You achieve maximum profit if the share price at expiration is above $50. As you can see, the risk/reward ratio is 0.22 to 1, which is the maximum loss divided by the maximum profit. That’s the good news. Risk is low. The bad news is that the likelihood of the share price being above the breakeven price of $37.75 [the lower $35 strike price + $2.75 net debit] at expiration is 27.3%, or slightly more than one in four. Based on the expected move for CCOI of $9.78 by June 18 (35.48%), the upper price is $37.33, and the lower price is $17.78. Between February 2021 and February 2026, Cogent’s share price traded above $50 until May 2025, hitting a five-year low of $15.96 last November. From the bottom, its shares are up 74%. From where I sit, it has a much higher chance of hitting the upper price than the lower one, making the bet a risk worth taking. Why Bet on Cogent? That’s not a bad question. As far as I can tell, there is no hope of Cogent making money in the near future — the analyst estimate for 2025 is a loss of $4.27 a share, and for 2026, a loss of $3.73 -- we’ll no more tomorrow morning. It will issue a press release detailing fourth-quarter results at 7 a.m. ET. Yet, four of 13 analysts rate it a Buy (3.54 out of 5), with only one rating it a Sell; the rest are on the fence. Analysts are paid well. There has to be a reason for four of them recommending investors buy the stock, which has a $30.55 target price, and a high target of $55. So, the November low I mentioned previously was due to Q3 2025 results, which saw revenues fall nearly 6% year-over-year, and, more importantly, the company announced a 98% cut in its quarterly dividend to $0.02 a share. At the time, the dividend yield was over 10% -- always a warning sign -- and is now 0.3%. If you’re an income investor, that’s of no interest. The question is, how long will it take to get back to a $1.0150-per-share dividend? Clearly, the analysts who say it’s a buy believe it will happen sooner rather than later. What proof is there? As far as I can tell, the company’s turnaround hinges on three things: new revenue streams that require less capital, savings from ongoing cost-cutting, and higher EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and EBITDA margins resulting from these two initiatives. In Q3 2025, its revenue from wavelength services was $10.2 million -- I’m not a techie by any means, but it seems positive -- up $1.1 million from the previous quarter and nearly double what it was a year ago. “At the end of the quarter, we had sold and provisioned waves in 454 locations as opposed to the 418 data centers that we had installed waves in at the end of Q2. We currently have a backlog and funnel of wave opportunities of 5,221 opportunitiesm” stated CEO and founder, David Schaeffer, in the Q3 2025 conference call. “We intend to continue to capture market share and believe our goal of 25% of the highly concentrated long-haul wavelength market in North America in 3 years is achievable.” At the same time, its revenue from leasing IPv4 addresses was $17.5 million in the third quarter, $2.2 million higher than Q2 2025 and 56% higher than Q3 2024. So, it’s essentially added over $11 million in revenue over the past 12 months from two newer initiatives. At the same time, it continues to monetize its 24 data centers. During the third quarter, it sold two of them for $144 million. The remainder will also be sold or leased to another party. Either way, that’s a significant short-term to mid-term revenue generator. As for cost-cutting, it said a year ago that it was 90% of the way toward its goal of generating $220 million in annual savings from integrating the Sprint wireline assets it acquired in late 2022. These assets included 20,000 miles of fiber. These two initiatives have led to higher EBITDA and EBITDA margins. In Q3 2025, its adjusted EBITDA was $73.8 million with a 30.5% EBITDA margin, 70 basis points higher than in Q2 2025. Things are moving in the right direction. But Is It Enough? The last year Cogent had an operating profit was 2022. Its EBITDA margin that year was 35.7%, so it’s not too far off that. It’s not a stock that I would choose to own, but there’s enough meat on the bone to justify a speculative bet on Cogent. While going with a lower call strike for the short portion of the bull call spread, say $40, is tempting, you’re trading significant profit for a slightly higher profitability of success. If it were me, I’d go with",

      "content": "Fed officials signal shocking twist on interest-rate cuts Mary Helen Gillespie Thu, February 19, 2026 at 12:17 PM CST 6 min read Investors and the White House may be betting on multiple interest-rate cuts this year, but the Federal Reserve just delivered a warning: The next move could be up, not down. Minutes of the January Federal Open Market Committee released Feb. 18 show several Fed officials discussed the possibility of raising interest rates if sticky inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target. That’s right: a resumption of interest-rate hikes if the nation’s labor market continues to stabilize but inflation persists. “Several participants indicated that they would have supported a two-sided description of the committee’s future interest-rate decisions, reflecting the possibility that upward adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate could be appropriate if inflation remains at above-target levels,” the minutes said. Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, told CNBC after the FOMC minutes were released that she “wouldn’t rule out” rising inflation. “There is a risk inflation could tick up,’’ she said, adding that Schwab has moved its forecast of a second rate cut to later in 2026. TheStreet/Federal Reserve Bank of New York · TheStreet&sol;Federal Reserve Bank of New York FOMC January meeting holds rates steady The FOMC voted 10-2 to hold interest rates steady at 3.50% to 3.75% in January on the benchmark Federal Funds Rate after three continuous cuts of 25 basis points in its last three meetings of 2025. The Federal Funds Rate guides interest rates for investors and consumers on auto and student loans , home-equity loans and credit cards. For consumers, a delayed rate cut could mean higher borrowing costs that remain in place longer than expected. President Donald Trump and other White House officials have repeatedly demanded that the independent central bank slash rates to as low as 1% immediately. Fed Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller dissented on the January pause, saying they would have preferred a 25-basis-point cut due to softening in the labor market. It was the FOMC’s first pause since July 2025. Related: Kevin Warsh’s net worth: The Trump Fed nominee’s wealth & income How the Fed manages interest rates The Fed’s dual congressional mandate requires it to balance inflation and job growth via interest rates. Lower interest rates support hiring but can fuel inflation. Higher rates cool prices but can weaken the job market . The two goals often conflict, operate on different timelines and are influenced by unpredictable global events. More Federal Reserve: Fed Chair Powell sends frustrating message on future interest-rate cuts After the December rate cut, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the lowering of rates brought monetary policy “within a broad range of neutral.” Story Continues A neutral rate neither stimulates nor restrains economic growth. Following the January meeting, Powell described the U.S. economy as “resilient” and said the Fed was well positioned to consider future changes in monetary policy. “The economy has once again surprised us with its strength, not for the first time,” Powell said. When the Fed last paused interest rates The Fed last paused interest rates in September 2023, holding the funds rate at 5.25% to 5.50% after a rapid tightening cycle aimed at curbing post-pandemic inflation. The pause lasted nearly a year as policymakers wanted to see whether higher borrowing costs would tame inflation without tipping the economy into a recession . During that pause, inflation gradually cooled and the labor market remained resilient. The central bank resumed cutting rates in September 2025 once Fed officials became confident that inflation was moving sustainably toward the Fed’s 2% target. FOMC minutes show a divided Fed The FOMC minutes do not name the participants. But a “vast majority” judged that employment risks have eased, leaving inflation and tariff implications to the growing concern of the central bank. Additional policy actions will be considered on a “ month-by-month” basis , the minutes said, underscoring that the next move is not guaranteed to be an interest-rate cut. But there is a possibility of further easing . “In considering the outlook for monetary policy, several participants commented that further downward adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate if inflation were to decline in line with their expectations,” the minutes said. Latest economic updates since the January FOMC The Fed is cautious about cutting rates too quickly out of concern it may be sending the wrong signal about its commitment to its 2% target. Simultaneously, policymakers don’t want to damage the labor market which showed significant signs of cooling late last year. Inflation and employment data published since the Fed’s January meeting show accelerating growth, slowing inflation and a stabilizing labor market. Overall inflation unexpectedly dropped to 2.4% in January from the same time last year. That was down from the previous 2.7% annual pace. Core inflation , which filters out volatile food and energy prices, ticked down to 2.5% on a year-over-year basis. It last stood at 2.6% . The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge -- Consumption Expenditures Price Index ( PCE ) -- will be released Feb. 20. Related: Fed official signals surprise rate-cut shift Since the Consumer Price Index rose less than expected last month, it may have addressed concerns of some Fed policymakers that inflation may be too high to cut interest rates more than once this year, especially after the hot January jobs report was much stronger than expected. The January jobs report on Feb. 11 delivered a sharp upside surprise, complicating expectations for Fed interest-rate cuts and reinforcing the view that the U.S. labor market remains more resilient than policymakers anticipated. Payrolls rose by the most in more than a year to 130,000 , beating estimates of 55,000. The unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 4.3% from 4.4%. Some Fed officials urge patience At the January meeting, participants debated whether their focus should be on supporting the labor market or on bringing inflation closer to its 2% target. “Some participants commented that it would likely be appropriate to hold the policy rate steady for some time as the Committee carefully assesses incoming data, and a number of these participants judged that additional policy easing may not be warranted until there was clear indication that the progress of disinflation was firmly back on track,” the minutes said. Since that January meeting, several Fed policymakers have maintained that an overall stable economy provides sufficient reasons to be patient before creating further interest-rate actions. They include Fed Governor Lisa Cook, Dallas Federal Reserve President Lorie Logan and Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack. “We feel the costs of elevated inflation with every shopping trip. The longer that inflation remains at these levels, the greater the risk that it becomes entrenched in the economy,’’ Hammock said. When will the next rate cut take place? In short, economists and market strategists broadly emphasized caution from the FOMC, saying the minutes indicate rate cuts are not imminent and that persistent inflation could even resurrect the case for future rate hikes. There is still a month of economic data, including the February jobs, CPI , and CPE reports, to be released before the March FOMC meeting. The CME Group FedWatch tool reports the likelihood of a quarter basis point cut in the upcoming 2025 FOMC meetings as: March 18: 5.9% April 29: 20.5% June 17: 49.2% July 29: 45.5% Sept. 16: 36.1% Oct. 28: 35.6% Dec. 9: 32.6% The numbers moved slightly downward after the FOMC minutes were released.

For the full year, e-commerce sales exceeded $150 billion for the first time, up 5.5% from two years ago, Walmart ( NASDAQ: WMT ) said in its fourth-quarter earnings report on Thursday. The e-commerce operation has well exceeded the breakeven level. Management said e-commerce was profitable each quarter last year in the U.S. market, with roughly double-digit incremental margin growth as the company enjoys the economies of scale from its marketplace infrastructure. Online sales were a mix of store-fulfilled pick up and delivery, as well as the third-party marketplace. In the United States, sales through store-fulfilled delivery channels grew more than 50%. Marketplace sales were up 20%, with a record 52% of sellers utilizing Walmart fulfillment services. Customers took advantage of Walmart’s fast-delivery service, with orders delivered in under three hours increasing more than 60% for the year, President and CEO John Furner said during a call with analysts. At Walmart U.S., 35% of store-fulfilled orders were delivered in under three hours in the fourth quarter. And the company is averaging delivery in less than an hour when customers opt for express delivery A new AI-powered agentic shopping assistant called Sparky is helping U.S. customers fill their digital cart with an average order value about 35% higher than non-Sparky customers. “When Sparky builds a basket, we execute it through fast delivery, pickup, or in store, turning AI engagement into immediate physical outcomes. And as we expand Sparky across experiences like voice, in store, and through services, we expect continued acceleration in customer adoption and the impact on commerce,” said Furner. Walmart’s e-commerce sales globally increased 24%, with the international business lagging the U.S. at 17% growth. In China, e-commerce sales grew 28% and represented more than 50% of the sales mix in that market. Flipkart, an e-commerce and quick-delivery platform in which Walmart owns a more than an 80% stake, is delivering orders in less than fifteen minutes across more than 30 cities in India. And Sam’s Club U.S. doubled growth in club-fulfilled delivery sales, according to management. During the previous quarter, the retailer’s e-commerce sales increased 27% year over year. Overall, Walmart said quarterly revenue increased 5.6% to $190.7 billion. Operating income was $800 million, up 10.8%. Net sales for Walmart U.S. was $129 billion. For the full year, operating income only grew 1.6% to $500 million because Walmart recorded two quarterly losses. Story Continues Strong inventory management Technology, artificial intelligence and automation helped Walmart keep inventory growth to half the rate of sales growth for the year, helping to keep a lid on costs. “In Walmart U.S., approximately 60% of stores are receiving some freight from automated distribution centers, and approximately 50% of e-commerce fulfillment center volume is automated. This enables better visibility into what inventory we own and inventory we can access and also improved our labor productivity. With the proximity so close to customers, we’re increasingly leveraging stores as digital fulfillment nodes to move inventory faster and more efficiently than ever before,” said David Guggina, the head of Walmart U.S. The number of facilities getting some form of automation will continue to grow this year as old conveyor systems are retired. Meanwhile, the retailer recently began deploying warehouse automation to Sam’s Club U.S. and its international operations, he added. The combination of hand-held scanners in stores with computer vision to map stocks, and careful seasonal ordering by buyers also helped Walmart manage its inventory levels.

Mohit Oberoi Thu, February 19, 2026 at 12:48 PM CST 4 min read AMZN The 13Fs for Q4 2025 have poured in, and Bill Ackman, Seth Klarman, and Stanley Druckenmiller are among the leading fund managers who added Amazon (AMZN) shares in the final quarter of the year. All three are legendary investors in their own right. Ackman rose to fame with his $27 million bet on credit default swaps in March 2020. It went down in history as one of the most iconic trades of all time, as that tiny bet soared to a whopping $2.6 billion within a month. Klarman is known for his value investing credentials and is often hailed as the “Oracle of Boston” and the “next Warren Buffett.” Druckenmiller, on the other hand, generated average annual returns of over 30% for three decades without even a single down year. With three of the best fund managers of the era betting on the Seattle-based tech giant, should you also follow suit? Let’s explore, beginning with the stock’s recent price action.

Get exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else. www.barchart.com Why Is Amazon Stock Underperforming? The e-commerce and cloud giant was the worst-performing “Magnificent 7” stock last year, and while it started 2026 on a strong note, it crashed following its Q4 confessional and is now down over 11% for the year, which makes it the second-worst Mag 7 after Microsoft (MSFT), whose post-earnings slump was the worst in the group. There are a couple of things that are making markets apprehensive about Amazon. The first is that it is gradually losing market share in the cloud sector to Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) and Microsoft. While Amazon underscores that it is still growing more in absolute dollar terms, the observation has failed to cut ice with investors. The second is a long-term question regarding the company’s digital advertising business, which is its second cash cow after the cloud business. Some see the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) agents as a death blow to that business, and no wonder Amazon sent a “cease and desist” letter to Perplexity over its Comet shopping agent. Finally, Amazon’s AI spending spree is making investors jittery, and the company forecasts a 2026 capex at $200 billion—well ahead of last year’s $131 billion and over $50 billion higher than what the Street was expecting. For context, it would be the highest ever annual capex by any company in history. Markets have been particularly unforgiving of Amazon’s burgeoning AI capex as it hasn’t seen much incremental growth for now. In contrast, Meta Platforms’ (META) revenues are growing at the fastest pace in years, and it forecasts a 30% year-over-year (YoY) topline growth for Q1 2026, as it reaps the rewards of its AI investments. Story Continues AMZN Stock Looks Undervalued Meanwhile, the recent underperformance has led to a contraction in Amazon’s multiples, and it now trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 25.5x. The current multiples are the lowest that they have ever been, and while there are genuine concerns over Amazon turning free cash flow negative amid its soaring capex, I am on the same page as Klarman, Ackman, and Druckenmiller and have been buying the dip in AMZN stock. www.barchart.com Should You Buy Amazon Stock? I remain constructive on AMZN stock and find it among the best value opportunities in the market currently, given the tepid valuations and reasonably strong growth outlook. AI initiatives should make the company’s e-commerce platform an even better proposition by further improving customer experience. Incidentally, Amazon’s shopping agent Rufus is gaining traction, with over 300 million people using it last year. Prime is another key part of Amazon’s flywheel, as it not only brings in subscription and ad revenues, but these customers tend to order more frequently on its e-commerce platform. The company has still just about scratched the surface in initiatives like grocery, pharmacy, and business-to-business (B2B), as well as the recently added low-cost platform Haul, which would help it take on the likes of Temu and Shein. Amazon Web Services (AWS) should also continue to benefit from strong AI demand even as its growth rates have lagged those of the other major players. Amazon’s chips business is also gaining momentum and is running at a $10 billion annualized revenue run rate. Amazon continues to work on efficiencies and is cutting its workforce by automating several jobs. These cost-cutting measures will help it offset the increase in depreciation expenses, which would stay elevated for the next few years as the AI capex flows into its income statement as depreciation expense. Overall, I am in the camp that believes that the tech selloff is overdone and am doubling down on names like Amazon, which provide quite attractive risk-reward after the crash.

      "content": "The Best Stocks to Buy with $1,000 in February: Why NVIDIA Is a Steal Eric Bleeker Thu, February 19, 2026 at 12:18 PM CST 5 min read META GOOG NVDA Quick Read NVIDIA (NVDA) is my top pick if you’re looking to buy a stock with $1,000 (or more) today. The company has an outstanding risk-reward profile, and I believe shares could reach $270 per share or higher across the next year. NVIDIA’s CEO says Blackwell GPU sales are off the charts and cloud GPUs are sold out. Data Center revenue hit $51.2B in Q3, up 66% year-over-year. Growth in 2026 could be even higher. A recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here . If you have $1,000 to invest, it can be daunting to find the right stock to get started investing. Thankfully, I'm confident the market is handing investors an opportunity at the beginning of 2026 that could be the perfect stock to buy whether you have $1,000, $5,000, or $10,000 or more to invest. That stock is NVIDIA ( NASDAQ: NVDA ). The name shouldn't be a surprise, but what might surprise you is how reasonable shares trade for. I'll also outline the opportunities ahead of NVIDIA in 2026 and why shares could see significant upside in the year ahead. From Gaming GPUs to AI Infrastructure Backbone NVIDIA's transformation is the business story of the AI era. What started as a gaming GPU company pivoted into accelerated computing at exactly the right time. The company went public in 1999, but the real inflection came when cloud companies realized GPUs could train AI models faster than anything else. By the time ChatGPT launched, NVIDIA had already built the CUDA software moat that made switching to competitors nearly impossible. The numbers tell the story. Over the past ten years, the stock has returned 24,361%. The five-year return stands at 1,164%. Even the one-year return of 35% beats the S&P 500 handily. However, even with all this performance in the rear-view mirror, 2026 is setting up well to be an absolutely epic year for NVIDIA. Blackwell Is the Catalyst Everyone's Waiting For The next leg up hinges on Blackwell, NVIDIA's latest GPU architecture. CEO Jensen Huang said on the Q3 earnings call: \"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out. Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference — each growing exponentially. We've entered the virtuous cycle of AI.\" Data Center revenue hit $51.2 billion in Q3, up 66% year-over-year. Networking revenue alone jumped 162%. Q4 guidance of $65 billion in revenue suggests momentum isn't slowing. With earnings scheduled for February 25, 2026, the market will get fresh confirmation that demand is still outpacing supply. Story Continues The big picture is NVIDIA's customers - hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet - are all spending massive sums on data centers this year. This comes at a time when NVIDIA's newest systems (the GB300) have dominated third-party testing and have little competition in terms of computing capabilities relative to cost. And NVIDIA has its foot on the throttle. The company is already starting limited production of its next-generation Vera Rubin systems. The fact of the matter is while we're years into the current AI boom, rival companies haven't really closed the gap with NVIDIA. Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) just announced a major partnership with NVIDIA to buy \"millions\" of Blackwell and Rubin GPUs for a reason: AI is an arms race, and NVIDIA is still the gold standard. What Kinds of Gains Could NVIDIA See in 2026? Let's talk about NVIDIA's 2026. Currently, the stock trades for about $186 per share. NVIDIA's current value is roughly $4.5 trillion, and the company had $99 billion in profits in the past year. That's a trailing P/E of 46X. On the surface, that looks like an outrageously expensive multiple to pay for a stock as big as NVIDIA. Yet, looking ahead, we find Wall Street expects NVIDIA to generate $7.76 in profits across the next year, which would be about 65% growth from this year. My bold call, NVIDIA will do closer to $9 per share in profits, and it's not unimaginable the company could generate $10 in earnings per share. The math is pretty simple: if NVIDIA does get to $10 per share in profits ( my most bullish case ), it would be trading at about 18.6X this year's earnings while more than doubling profits. Generally, when stocks are experiencing this level of earnings growth, they 're-rate,' that is to say they trade at higher multiples. Applying a 30X multiple to NVIDIA, we'd find the stock would trade at $270 per share if they hit $9 in EPS this year or $300 per share if they hit $10 in EPS. That means, NVIDIA shares - even after their incredible run the past decade - could still see 45% or more upside potential this year. On a $1,000 buy, that could be worth $450 in profits. On a $10,000 buy, it would be worth $4,500 in profits. Does all this mean NVIDIA will certainly have a great year? No. Every stock carries risk. However, I also laid out the case how NVIDIA could hit $200 per share back when it was trading at $130 per share ( video embedded below) and NVIDIA shares hit that price in less than a year. If you're thinking NVIDIA's run is over, the next twelve months could see its most epic performance yet. Data Shows One Habit Doubles American’s Savings And Boosts Retirement Most Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t. And no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it’s shocking more people don’t adopt the habit given how easy it is . Terms and Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices More Info",

      "content": "The Backbone of America: Why This Bank ETF Is a Must-Watch for Value Investors Todd Shriber, The Motley Fool Thu, February 19, 2026 at 12:20 PM CST 4 min read ^GSPC Despite the technological innovation seen in the U.S. and around the world, the banking system remains one of the most essential lubricants of the economic engine. Banks don't just take deposits, though that is one of the industry's important functions. These institutions extend the credit needed for companies to expand and for people to buy houses. Financial institutions support the vibrant functioning of capital markets, and banks backstop vital consumer needs, such as auto loans and credit cards. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks » This bank ETF offers value and the potential for rising dividends. Image source: Getty Images. Accounting for all of that, perhaps it's not surprising that financial services is the second-largest sector in the S&P 500 . Investors can access financial stocks broadly via an array of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including the Invesco KBW Bank ETF (NASDAQ: KBWB) . In fact, this ETF has the industry focus (and other positives) that bank investors may be seeking. With financial ETFs, details matter Investors seeking exposure to a basket of bank stocks need to examine the differences among the ETFs that track them. For example, the State Street Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF isn't a bank ETF. Instead, it represents the financial services stocks found in the S&P 500, meaning it includes credit card network operators, index providers, and insurance carriers, among other non-bank entities. Conversely, the Invesco bank ETF, which is the third-largest financial services ETF of any stripe, focuses solely on bank equities. Although this $6.1 billion ETF holds just 25 stocks, it features an admirable mix of investment, large-scale money-center , and regional banks. Among the Invesco ETFs' top 10 holdings, investors will find Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley , meaning the fund has leverage to what's happening on Wall Street, including possible upticks in initial public offering (IPO) and merger and acquisition activity. Those exposures don't mean this ETF is all about the \"Wall Street elite.\" Extensive exposure to regional banks underscores the fund's Main Street feel. More important than those vibes is the fact that regional banks are considered prime value destinations among banking stocks. That includes US Bancorp , Huntington Bancshares , and Western Alliance Bancorp , all of which are members of this ETF's portfolio. This ETF has dividend growth potential Seasoned investors know that, before the global financial crisis, it was tough to beat bank stocks for reliable dividend growth. However, that calamity led to a spate of payout suspensions that dramatically altered the banking industry's dividend complexion. Story Continues More than a decade removed from the crisis, bank dividends are on the mend as the most prominent U.S. financial institutions consistently pass the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests. Last year, multiple members of the Invesco KBW Bank ETF lineup, including most of the top 10 holdings, received the green light to boost shareholder rewards programs. The fund's trailing-12-month distribution rate of 2.01% implies ample room for long-term payout growth, which banks could use to attract more investors. This ETF's annual expense ratio is 0.35%, or $35 on a $10,000 investment. Should you buy stock in Invesco Exchange-Traded Fund Trust II - Invesco Kbw Bank ETF right now? Before you buy stock in Invesco Exchange-Traded Fund Trust II - Invesco Kbw Bank ETF, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Invesco Exchange-Traded Fund Trust II - Invesco Kbw Bank ETF wasn’t one of them.

      "content": "Stock Market Today, Feb. 19: Stocks decline after perplexing Fed commentary Noah Weidner Thu, February 19, 2026 at 12:17 PM CST 5 min read GC=F This live blog is refreshed periodically throughout the day with the latest updates from the market. To find the latest Stock Market Today threads, click here . Happy Thursday. This is TheStreet’s Stock Market Today for Feb. 19, 2026. You can follow the latest updates on the market here in our daily live blog. Update: 4:01 p.m. ET Closing Bell The U.S. markets are now closed. The Russell 2000 (+0.25%) finished out the day as the only index in the green, rallying in strength in the closing 15 minutes of trading. Meanwhile, large cap indexes such as the S&P 500 (-0.28%), Nasdaq (-0.31%), and Dow (-0.54%) struggled today amid geopolitical worries. The prospect of a conflict with Iran is hanging over markets, pushing up commodity prices like oil and gold, while weighing on equities. Worries from yesterday's FOMC Minutes also persisted into today, joined by fresh woes about the state of private credit. Fresh reverberations from the industry were a mainstay of the market today, with firms like Blue Owl leading alternative asset managers lower: Update: 3:40 p.m. ET Coming Up: P.M. Earnings Coming up after the market closes, Newmont Corp. , Comfort Systems , and Consolidated Edison will be among the largest reports. Also, Live Nation Entertainment , Texas Roadhouse , and Sprouts Farmers Market might offer an interesting perspective on the state of the consumer. Update: 1:07 p.m. ET Afternoon Update Heading into the latter part of the trading day, stocks are more or less where they opened the day, after an attempt at a comeback trade faded. The Dow (-0.55%) is off more than half a percentage point, while the Nasdaq (-0.39%), Russell 2000 (-0.39%), and S&P 500 (-0.36%) have crowded together amid a retreat in the broader market. Let's take a look at what stocks are winning and losing today: Winners Remitly Global (+26%) is having a dominant performance today, the top stock of the day after CEO Matt Oppenheimer announced he would step down and be succeeded by an executive at American bank Santander. Losers Klarna Group (-26%) was the worst performer of the day among firms worth at least $2 billion. Despite its revenue surpassing $1 billion, the company swung to a loss as costs rose at the business. Avis Budget Group (-23%) also had some trouble in its report, missing in its P.M. report yesterday. The company's loss was significantly higher than expected, while revenue failed to clear expectations. In other notable declines, Carvana fell 8% today after its P.M. report also spooked investors, drumming up conversation around short seller reports into the company. Story Continues Blue Owl Capital is also on today's loser list after suspending withdrawals from one of its retail-facing private credit funds. More on that in a short bit. Update: 9:30 - 10:00 a.m. ET Opening Bell The stock market is open. This morning, 60.7% (3,373) U.S. issues are declining according to FinViz, with yesterday's FOMC Minutes and this morning's economic data appearing to do a number on stocks this morning. At first glance, investors are still marinating on it. The Nasdaq (-0.08%) and S&P 500 (-0.13%) are both down by a few basis points out of the gate, while the Dow (-0.39%) and Russell 2000 (-0.51%) have undone yesterday's gains. However, with the session barely started, it appears the indexes' declines could be steepening. We'll check back in soon. S&P 500 In Focus In S&P 500 related antics, just five sectors of the index are in the green today, lifted by energy (+1.37%), utilities (+0.86%), and communication (+0.62%). On the flip side, financials (-0.68%), health care (-0.65%), and discretionary (-0.63%) are seeing the largest declines. On Iran Watch Per reports from the last few days, President Donald Trump appears keen to involve the U.S. in a conflict with Iran, which has pushed up the price of various commodities. Today, those commodities are more tempered, even as the President foreshadows the use of force in the region. Continuous futures in Gold (+0.38% to $5,028.30) and Silver (+0.55% to $78.025) are getting a nice bump from the worries. Crude Oil (+2.04% to $66.38) is leaping by even bigger amounts because of the possible effects. Dollar Time This morning, the Dollar Index hit a four-week high, at 98.074. That's a nice recovery after President Donald Trump's new Fed nominee, Kevin Warsh , briefly shook up the markets with worries about his more dovish attitude on the markets. Concurrently, the 10Y Treasury today is just 0.7 bips higher at 4.088%. Update: 9:01 a.m. ET A.M. Update Good morning. Stock futures this morning appear to be down, continuing a late day decline from yesterday. It appears to be related to the release of the Federal Reserve 's FOMC Minutes, which showed a mix of perspectives on the trajectory for interest rates. We'll have more on that once the market opens in about 30 minutes. Until then, let's take a look at this morning's earnings and economic data slate that awaits: A.M Earnings: Walmart, Deere, Rio Tinto This morning, retail giant Walmart reported earnings, joined by Deere , Rio Tinto , and Southern Company , among others. Stocks with their price in green have started off the day in the green after their earnings, a sign of a positive report. Economic Data + Events This morning has been anticipated for the sheer volume of economic data on the docket, much of which is already out: Initial Jobless Claims (Feb. 14) : 206K (down from 229K last week) Continuing Claims (Feb. 7): 1.869 million (up from 1.852 million) Both the Balance of Trade and Goods Trade Balance worsened as imports rose; exports declined. Despite that, the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index (Feb) came in at 16.3, up from 12.6 last month. There's also plenty more to come after the market opens: This story was originally published by TheStreet on Feb 19, 2026, where it first appeared in the Latest Business & Market News section.

A Palantir office building in Tokyo_ Image by Hiroshi-Mori-Stock via Shutterstock_ Amit Singh Thu, February 19, 2026 at 12:55 PM CST 3 min read PLTR Palantir (PLTR) stock, which was once viewed as one of the market’s most unstoppable AI plays, has pulled back sharply. Shares are down about 25% year-to-date (YTD) and now trade about 35% below their 52-week high despite the company’s solid performance. The recent weakness in PLTR stock is due to two primary concerns. First, valuation. For much of the past two years, Palantir commanded a premium valuation. Its extremely high valuation compared to peers weighed on investors’ sentiment. More News from Barchart QQQ Just Sent a Chilling Signal — Right Before Nvidia Earnings Has Palantir Bottomed? Probably, Based on Huge, Unusual Put Options Activity in PLTR SoftBank Just Sold $3.6 Billion Worth of Nvidia Stock. Should You Ditch NVDA Too? Tired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now! At the same time, a new concern emerged from the rapid rise of AI agents for the broader software ecosystem. Investors fear that powerful AI agents could hurt the prospects of software vendors like Palantir. So far, however, the company’s business momentum and solid outlook tell a different story. Palantir continues to post accelerating revenue growth, supported by strong demand for its AI Platform (AIP) across both government and commercial customers. Rather than being displaced by AI agents, Palantir appears to be positioning itself as an enabler, helping organizations deploy and operationalize AI at scale within complex, regulated environments. Further, Palantir's stock has gotten cheaper due to the recent selloff, easing some valuation concerns and improving the risk-reward profile. Also, analysts’ sentiment toward PLTR stock improved, supporting its investment case. www.barchart.com Palantir’s Outlook Indicates Solid Growth in 2026 Palantir entered 2026 with strong operating momentum, reflecting accelerating revenue growth, expanding margins, and significant demand for its AIP. After delivering 56% year-over-year (YoY) revenue growth in 2025, the company has guided 2026 revenue between $7.182 billion and $7.198 billion. At the midpoint, the guidance implies 61% YoY growth, indicating further acceleration. The key growth driver for Palantir will once again be its U.S. segment. The company’s U.S. commercial revenue surged 137% YoY in the fourth quarter, while U.S. government revenue expanded 66%. The commercial segment reflects increasing enterprise adoption of AIP for production-grade AI deployments. Palantir is likely to benefit from the expanding wallet share among existing clients and strong new customer acquisition. During 2025, Palantir closed $4.3 billion in U.S. commercial total contract value bookings, a 161% increase from the prior year. Remaining deal value in the U.S. commercial business climbed 145%, indicating significant growth ahead. Customer count in the U.S. commercial reached 571, up 49% YoY. Story Continues Looking ahead, U.S. commercial revenue is projected to exceed $3.144 billion in 2026, implying growth of at least 115%. Meanwhile, the U.S. government segment is expected to benefit from continued execution on existing programs and incremental contract awards. Importantly, Palantir’s strong revenue growth is translating into solid margins. In the fourth quarter, the company generated $798 million in adjusted operating income, representing a 57% margin. For 2025, adjusted operating income reached $2.3 billion, with a 50% margin, an expansion of 1,100 basis points from 2024. Adjusted free cash flow also totaled $2.3 billion, translating to a 51% margin and 82% YoY growth. The strong demand and solid margins indicate that Palantir is still in a high-growth phase and is likely to expand margins and generate strong cash flow. Will Buying the Dip in PLTR Stock Pay Off? Palantir continues to deliver strong growth supported by expanding commercial adoption and sustained government demand. While the stock’s valuation remains elevated, the recent decline has meaningfully eased some concerns. PLTR stock trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 70.84, which is significantly below its prior peak levels. Wall Street sentiment has also turned more constructive. Just one month ago, seven analysts rated the stock a “Strong Buy.” That number has now increased to 13, reflecting growing confidence in the company’s execution and long-term positioning in the AI space. The average analyst price target is $200.43, implying roughly 48% upside from current levels. Overall, Palantir’s strong growth trajectory, easing valuation concerns, improving analysts’ sentiment, and notable upside potential indicate that buying the dip could pay off. www.barchart.com On the date of publication, Amit Singh did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

A concept image showing a virus attacking blood cells by crystal light via Shutterstock Aanchal Sugandh Thu, February 19, 2026 at 4:47 PM EST 3 min read NVDA RXRX ARKK When artificial intelligence (AI) chip maker NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) heads for the exit, investors instinctively glance at the door. In its latest 13F filing, the chip giant disclosed that it had completely exited its position in the AI-driven drug developer Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX). At the end of Q3 2025, Nvidia held 7.71 million shares. The stake represented a modest slice of its expansive, meticulously managed AI portfolio. Still, the headline carried weight. Traders pushed the stock down as much as 14% during the session before buyers regrouped and lifted it to a nearly 2% gain by the close of Wednesday, Feb 18.

Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else. Yet Nvidia’s decision did not trigger a stampede for the exits. Shortly after the disclosure, Cathie Wood stepped in. ARK Invest (ARKK) purchased 1.25 million shares of Recursion across two ETFs, adding to a position it had steadily built in recent months. She saw opportunity where others saw uncertainty. The contrast could not look clearer. Nvidia redeployed capital while ARK accumulated shares. One AI heavyweight stepped aside while another has pressed forward. So, let us examine which stance makes the most sense on the stock. About Recursion Stock Headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, Recursion Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biotechnology company that industrializes drug discovery by integrating biology, chemistry, automation, data science, and engineering. With a market cap of roughly $1.8 billion, it advances multiple therapies across oncology, rare diseases, and infectious conditions. However, the market has shown little patience. Over the past 52 weeks, RXRX stock has fallen 66.1%. Over the last six months alone, it has dropped 27.6%. www.barchart.com Valuation adds another layer to the debate. RXRX stock is currently trading at 29.82 times sales, a multiple that stands above the industry average and signals a premium. A Closer Look at Recursion’s Q3 Earnings On Nov. 5, 2025, Recursion reported its Q3 fiscal 2025 results, wherein the company generated $5.2 million in revenue, marking an 80.2% year-over-year (YOY) decline and falling well short of the $16.98 million which analysts had expected. Story Continues The bottom line told a similar story. Recursion posted a net loss of $162.3 million, widening 69.4% YOY. Loss per share came in at $0.36. Although that figure beat the consensus estimate of a $0.31 loss per share, it still deepened 5.9% from the previous year's quarter. Management, however, reinforced its financial footing. After utilizing its at-the-market facility, the company reported approximately $785 million in cash and cash equivalents as of Oct. 9, 2025. Leadership expects that capital to fund operations through the end of 2027 under current plans, without additional financing. Operationally, Recursion has also advanced its long-term strategy. It secured a $30 million milestone payment from Roche and Genentech for delivering a second neuro map focused on microglial immune cells. The achievement pushed total upfront and milestone payments from partnerships above $500 million, underscoring tangible validation from industry heavyweights. Looking ahead, Recursion is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2025 results on Wednesday, Feb. 25, before markets open. Analysts expect Q4 loss per share to narrow 47.2% YOY to $0.28. For full-year 2025, they project a 5.9% improvement to a $1.59 loss per share, followed by another 35.2% narrowing to $1.03 in fiscal year 2026. What Do Analysts Expect for Recursion Stock? Despite the recent pullback, Wall Street has not abandoned RXRX stock. Analysts currently assign the stock an overall “Moderate Buy” rating. Among nine covering the name, two issue “Strong Buy” ratings, one recommends “Moderate Buy,” and six advise “Hold.” Price targets further reinforce the measured confidence. The average price target of $7 represents potential upside of 88%. Meanwhile, the Street-high target of $11 suggests a gain of 195.7% from current levels. If the company delivers on expectations, those projections could turn today’s caution into tomorrow’s reward. www.barchart.com www.barchart.com On the date of publication, Aanchal Sugandh did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "content": "Trump Policy Reversal Sparks $65 Billion Dollar Bleed in EV Sector Haley Zaremba Thu, February 19, 2026 at 5:00 PM EST 4 min read Last week, the Trump administration delivered “ one of the single largest deregulatory actions in U.S. history ” when it ended the 2009 “endangerment finding,” which definitively and legally classified carbon dioxide as a threat to public health. This legislation fundamentally underpinned any legal authority at the federal level to restrict greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. As such, this action rescinds all emissions standards for cars and trucks effective immediately, with enormous implications for the electric vehicles market, the gas-powered automotive industry, and for the climate. The end of the “endangerment finding” is just the latest in a laundry list of anti-EV and anti-climate policies that Trump has taken since he took office last year. The Trump administration previously rolled back a Biden-era $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles in September. As a result, the domestic and international EV sector has already been showing major signs of distress, even before emissions standards were repealed this month. As a result of these policy pivots, in addition to a landscape previously shaped by “overstated enthusiasm for the green transition,” EV makers are now reporting enormous losses and slashing programs left and right. On a global level, EV producers have registered $65 billion in write-offs since the end of the U.S. EV tax credit last fall, according to reporting from. Ford, for example, recently disclosed a US$19.5bn writedown and the cancellation of its electric F-150 pick-up truck. But the problem is not limited to U.S. automakers; many European firms were also counting on U.S. markets. Stellantis, an automaker based in the Netherlands, planned for electric cars to represent half of its U.S. sales by 2030. Current projections put U.S. EV demand at just 5% of the new vehicle market over the next few years. As a result, Stellantis “took a $26 billion hit after scrapping several fully electric models and reviving its 5.7-litre engine for the US market” according to reporting from nonpartisan news outlet Semafor. While the EV market suffers, the Trump administration promises that these policy changes will provide a windfall for traditional automakers. The administration reportedly estimates that “an average cost savings of over $2,400 per vehicle for traditional manufacturers.” While EV market contraction is intimately related to the 180 in EV policy between the Biden and Trump administrations, it is also a reflection of wider issues in the sector: overestimating EV demand, failing to produce affordable EV models, and under-developing charging infrastructure. In short, automakers got ahead of themselves and failed to make markets realistic for consumers. “Everyone got caught up in the kind of euphoria of ‘look at the valuations Tesla was getting’ . . . and they didn’t bring the customers with them,” Bernstein analyst Stephen Reitman recently told EV magazine. Story Continues However, despite the major contraction in global EV markets, electric cars are not dead in the water. While things are looking grimmer than ever for EVs in the United States, especially in light of the fresh slashing of lawmakers' ability to regulate emissions, other EV markets around the world are still going strong. While many European automakers are reeling from the loss of the U.S. market, there is still strong and growing demand elsewhere – in the European Union, sales of fully ?electric vehicles overtook those of gas-only vehicles for the first time in history in December. And emerging markets are showing strong demand for EVs, “leapfrogging legacy auto markets in the process.” Ember, a global think tank, reports that emerging markets are embracing EVs with vigor, with particularly strong growth in Southeast Asia, India, Mexico and Brazil. In 2025, over a quarter of new vehicle sales in emerging markets were electric. “Emerging markets will shape the future of the global car market,” the December report says. “The choices made now on charging infrastructure and early support will determine how fast this momentum continues.” Of course, a supportive policy environment is key.

The system used to underpin massive revenue streams from margin loans and securities-based lending to settlement and custody fees. But a new frontier is emerging at the edges of that system. Tokenized equities — real shares wrapped or reissued as blockchain tokens — threaten traditional brokerages. What if investors could hold actual stock exposure and unlock liquidity without selling the shares? That future might come sooner than expected — perhaps even this year. Most Read from MarketWatch The S&P 500 is undergoing a historic shift that could reshape the stock market Here’s what’s driving the U.S. dollar to its strongest position in almost a month — and it’s not just Iran tensions The sobering way most Americans plan to use their tax refunds this year What a fiasco. Trump’s tariffs are an economic and legal mess. What are tokenized stocks — and why do they matter? Tokenized stocks are, in essence, digital representations of traditional equities. The idea is straightforward: A firm holds real shares in regulated custody and issues a blockchain token that represents each share (or a fraction of one). That token can then trade on blockchain-enabled platforms, carry economic exposure to the underlying company, and — depending on the structure — might even carry certain shareholder rights. Proponents say tokenization offers a number of compelling advantages: Importantly, and often understated, tokenized equities remain tied to the traditional financial-asset universe; they are not “crypto-only” fictions but rather a bridge between legacy asset classes and blockchain infrastructure. But tokenization doesn’t magically erase regulation or risk — therein lies the tension. While tokenized equities promise a “digital upgrade,” realizing their benefits at scale requires navigating legal, structural and market-microstructure challenges. The buildup starts now Tokenization of real-world assets — including equities — is no longer niche . Mainstream financial institutions are exploring token-friendly custody and settlement, global exchanges are piloting digital-asset divisions, and asset managers are assessing tokenized share classes On the retail side, leading platforms are already live. Kraken has built a product called “ xStocks ,” where tokenized representations of real stocks and ETFs (backed 1:1 by underlying equities) are issued on-chain, and can be traded — in principle — outside of traditional market hours. Kraken’s xStocks product lets traders access tokenized shares of major U.S. stocks and ETFs and trade them 24 hours a day during weekdays on its platform Story Continues The platform’s traction is growing: In late 2025, Kraken reported its tokenized equities business surpassed $10 billion in total transaction volume. Meanwhile, Galaxy Digital and Superstate launched an onchain version of GLXY Class A common stock on Solana via Superstate’s “Opening Bell,” positioning it as the first tokenization of SEC-registered public equity on a major public blockchain. In this structure, existing shareholders can move shares into tokenized form, and ownership updates are handled through the regulated transfer-agent workflow rather than a purely synthetic “price-tracking” token model — an important proof point for full-fidelity tokenized equities. Industry analysts argue that tokenization could reshape aspects of capital markets: instant settlement, fractionalization, global access and on-chain ownership records — all attributes that may appeal to both retail and institutional investors. Taken together, these developments suggest that 2026 could be the inflection point when tokenized equities shift from experimentation to infrastructure. What’s at stake: Winners, losers and the coming shift The rise of tokenized stocks doesn’t just create new opportunities — it threatens cornerstone revenue models of traditional brokerages and their associated infrastructure. Potential Winners The strategy is already visible in the market. Kraken has moved to consolidate its tokenized equities stack by acquiring Backed , the issuer behind its xStocks products. The deal folds issuance, custody coordination and distribution into a single platform — mirroring how traditional brokerages vertically integrated clearing and custody over decades. If tokenized equities scale, this kind of control over both the rails and the asset layer may prove decisive. Potential losers For shareholders, the key question isn’t whether tokenization works, it’s how much of your broker’s earnings depend on activities tokenized stocks could displace. At brokerage giant Charles Schwab SCHW, for example, net interest income from cash sweeps and securities lending made up nearly half of total revenue in the second-quarter of 2025 ($2.82 billion of $5.85 billion). At Interactive Brokers Group IBKR, fourth-quarter 2024 net interest income hit $807 million — driven by margin loans and credit balances — versus just $477 million in commissions. Robinhood Markets HOOD, meanwhile, derived 42% of its second-quarter 2024 revenue from net interest ($285 million of $682 million total), with net-interest revenue growing 25% year over year by the fourth quarter of 2024. Even Morgan Stanley’s MS Wealth Management division, with $6.2 trillion in client assets , depends on sticky balances and net interest spreads from E*Trade and workplace channels. Each of these firms are telling shareholders that net-interest income on client cash and margin is durable and scalable. But if tokenized equities indeed become a mainstream way to unlock liquidity in 2026, that assumption faces a real test. Beyond brokerages, clearinghouses and legacy settlement infrastructure also face pressure. If settlement moves on-chain and peer-to-peer, centralized clearing and post-trade processes become less central — threatening a whole layer of traditional capital-markets infrastructure. Regulatory reality and practical hurdles Tokenization doesn’t bypass existing securities regulations. While the SEC has been developing an “innovation exemption” concept to ease certain compliance pathways, major exchange and industry groups — including the World Federation of Exchanges and Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association — warn that broad exemptive relief could let tokenized venues sidestep core securities rules around best execution, market surveillance and investor protection. This push-pull matters for tokenized equities specifically, because the eventual rule shape will influence whether tokenized stock venues look more like regulated exchanges (with familiar protections) or more like lightly-gated on-chain markets (with novel risks). They remain legally regulated securities (or at least must navigate securities-law frameworks), and many structural, legal and practical challenges remain. Tokenized stocks can lack certain traditional investor rights and protections. Regulators and critics warn that for many tokenized offerings, buyers do not gain real shareholder rights (voting, governance, dividend-distribution mechanisms). Liquidity remains a persistent issue . While many real-world assets have been tokenized, trading volume remains low and secondary markets are thin, even when tokens promise 24/7 tradability. Why 2026 is pivotal The case for 2026 as a turning point is anchored in specific regulatory and infrastructure milestones converging that year: Nasdaq’s tokenization push: The most tangible catalyst is Nasdaq’s rule filing to let investors trade tokenized U.S. stocks and exchang",

Wajeeh Khan Thu, February 19, 2026 at 4:37 PM EST 2 min read ETSY EBAY Etsy (ETSY) stock closed nearly 10% higher on Feb. 19, after the e-commerce firm divested Depop, its fashion resale platform, to eBay (EBAY) for $1.2 billion in cash. On Thursday, Etsy reported better-than-expected per-share earnings for its fiscal Q4 as well, which helped its stock price push briefly above its 20-day moving average (MA). While this technical setup often precedes a relief rally, neither fourth-quarter release nor Depop sale warrant buying ETSY stock at current levels.

Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else. Despite today’s gains, Etsy remains down about 25% versus its year-to-date high. www.barchart.com Investing in Etsy Stock Is a Risky Proposition Etsy sold its fashion resale platform for $1.2 billion, much less than the $1.62 billion that it spent on buying it nearly five years ago. The divestiture completes Etsy’s exit from its failed “house of brands” strategy — a diversification push that evidently didn’t create shareholder value. Investors are cautioned against chasing the rally in ETSY shares also because its gross merchandise sales declined significantly on a currency-neutral basis in Q4 as the company’s core marketplace experienced contraction instead of growth. Moreover, the NYSE-listed firm is losing its ability to attract active buyers as evidenced by a 2% year-over-year decline in users to 93.54 million, despite aggressive marketing investments. Options Data Suggests Downside Head in ETSY Shares Etsy stock remains unattractive as a long-term holding also because the company guided for up to $2.43 billion in gross merchandise sales for its fiscal Q1 — a huge step down from $2.8 billion last year. This signals deteriorating consumer demand as inflationary pressures and economic uncertainty continues to weigh on discretionary spending. Moreover, since ETSY remains decisively below its longer-term MAs (50-day, 100-day, 200-day), it’s reasonable to assume that the stock’s broader downtrend remains intact. According to Barchart, the put-to-call ratio on options contracts expiring early March sits at 4.56x currently, indicating significant skew to the downside. The lower price of $43.83 on those contracts suggests Etsy could lose nearly 9% over the next few weeks. Story Continues How Wall Street Recommends Playing Etsy Despite aforementioned headwinds, Wall Street firms maintain a mean target of about $66 on Etsy shares. However, downward revisions could follow after the company’s muted Q4 release on Feb. 19. www.barchart.com This article was created with the support of automated content tools from our partners at Sigma.AI.

The strategy is driven by a favorable ROI where the $34 average acquisition cost in Q4 is immediately offset by a $40 annual membership fee and $10 in transactional revenue. Revenue growth of 9% was supported by all reporting segments, though advertising and commerce experienced softness that management expects to persist into Q1 2026. The transition to a paid subscription model aims to reduce reliance on the volatile advertising market by building a stable, predictable revenue base. Operating margins were temporarily pressured by the immediate expensing of marketing costs while membership revenue is recognized ratably over 12 months. Management noted a divergence in the travel market where luxury travel remains robust while the lower-end segment faces more significant economic challenges. 2026 Outlook and Scalability Membership fees are projected to account for approximately 25% of total revenue this year as the subscriber base matures. Management plans to increase member acquisition spending in 2026 compared to 2025, provided the quick payback and positive ROI metrics hold. Profitability is expected to improve as the first major cohorts of members reach their renewal dates, generating revenue without associated acquisition costs. The company raised the U.S. membership fee to $50 effective January 1, 2026, to further enhance the unit economics of the subscription business. Travelzoo META experiences are now scheduled for a Q2 2026 launch and will be integrated as a core benefit for Club Members. Operational and Structural Adjustments G&A expenses saw a non-permanent increase in Q4 due to a one-time cost associated with a global company meeting. A $0.08 reduction in Q4 EPS was specifically attributed to the accounting mismatch between immediate marketing expenses and deferred revenue recognition. Jack's Flight Club shifted focus toward profitability in Q4, maintaining premium subscriber levels to offset attrition rather than pursuing aggressive growth. The company launched a 24/7 Travel Enthusiast Hotline in partnership with Allianz to increase the perceived value and retention of the membership product. Q&A Session Insights Drivers of advertising softness and membership revenue cadence Our analysts just identified a stock with the potential to be the next Nvidia. Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Story Continues Management attributed advertising softness to a lack of aggressive luxury offers and a heavy internal focus on the membership transition. The slight slowing in membership revenue growth was characterized as a rounding issue, with expectations for acceleration in 2026. Sustainability of marketing spend and cash flow impact Marketing spend will remain aggressive as long as acquisition costs stay below the membership fee threshold. Operating cash flow remains protected because members pay the full annual fee upfront, effectively self-funding the acquisition costs. Member churn and retention of the 2025 cohort Management stated it is too early to judge churn as the first major 2025 cohorts are only now reaching their renewal windows. New benefits like airport lounge access and the Allianz hotline are intended to 'lock in' members regardless of immediate booking activity. Impact of the U.S. membership fee increase to $50 The increase applies to all new members and any existing members who did not take advantage of a $40 renewal grace period in January. The fee hike is currently limited to the U.S. market to test price elasticity and improve margins. One stock. Nvidia-level potential. 30M+ investors trust Moby to find it first. Get the pick.

Stock indexes settled lower on Thursday, led by losses in chipmakers and AI-infrastructure stocks, amid renewed caution over the outlook for artificial intelligence.  Concerns remain that AI could disrupt entire sectors of the economy and that the huge investments in the technology may not pay off.  Stocks also face some negative carryover from Wednesday, when the minutes of the Jan 27-28 FOMC meeting stated that “several” policymakers suggested the Fed may need to raise interest rates if inflation stays above its goal.

Geopolitical risks also undercut stocks on Thursday.  WTI crude oil (CLH26) rose more than +1% to a 6.5-month high on comments from the head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, who said the US military buildup in the Middle East means Iran’s window to reach a diplomatic agreement over its nuclear activities is at risk of closing.  Also, President Trump said Thursday that “really bad things will happen” if there is no deal with Iran. Thursday’s US economic news was mixed for stocks.  On the positive side, weekly jobless claims fell to a 5-week low, and the Feb Philadelphia business outlook survey unexpectedly rose to a 5-month high.  Conversely, the Dec trade deficit widened more than expected to a 5-month high, and Jan pending home sales unexpectedly declined. Hawkish comments on Thursday from Fed Governor Stephen Miran were bearish for stocks, as he said he now sees a \"less accommodative\" interest rate path, given that US employment has held up better than anticipated and goods inflation has been more stubborn. US weekly initial unemployment claims fell -23,000 to a 5-week low of 206,000, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of 225,000. The US Feb Philadelphia business outlook survey unexpectedly rose +3.7 to a 5-month high of 16.3, stronger than expectations of a decline to 7.5. Story Continues The US Dec trade deficit was -$70.3 billion, wider than expectations of -$55.5 billion and the biggest deficit in 5 months. US Jan pending home sales unexpectedly fell -0.8% m/m, weaker than expectations of a +2.0% m/m increase. The market’s focus is on corporate earnings results and economic news. On Friday, Q4 GDP is expected to expand by +3.0% (q/q annualized), and the Q4 core price index is expected to climb by +2.6%.  Also, Dec personal spending is expected to rise by +0.4% m/m and Dec personal income is expected to be up +0.3% m/m.  In addition, the Dec core PCE price index (the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge) is expected to be up +0.3% m/m and +2.9% y/y.  The Feb S&P manufacturing PMI is expected to slip by -0.1 to 52.3, and Dec new home sales will be released.  Finally, the University of Michigan Feb consumer sentiment index is expected to be revised slightly lower to 57.2 from 57.3. Q4 earnings season is nearing its end, with more than three-quarters of the S&P 500 companies having reported earnings results.  Earnings have been a positive factor for stocks, with 74% of the 418 S&P 500 companies that have reported beating expectations.  According to Bloomberg Intelligence, S&P earnings growth is expected to climb by +8.4% in Q4, marking the tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth.  Excluding the Magnificent Seven megacap technology stocks, Q4 earnings are expected to increase by +4.6%. The markets are discounting a 6% chance for a -25 bp rate cut at the next policy meeting on March 17-18. Overseas stock markets settled mixed on Thursday.  The Euro Stoxx 50 closed down -0.72%.  China’s Shanghai Composite is closed for the week-long Lunar New Year holidays.  Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.57%. Interest Rates March 10-year T-notes (ZNH6) on Thursday closed up +0.5 of a tick.  The 10-year T-note yield fell -1.2 bp to 4.071%.  T-notes recovered from early losses on Thursday and settled slightly higher as heightened geopolitical risks with Iran knocked stocks lower and boosted safe-haven demand for government debt. T-notes initially moved lower on Thursday after better-than-expected US economic news showed weekly jobless claims fell to a 5-week low, and the Feb Philadelphia business outlook survey unexpectedly rose to a 5-month high. T-notes also have negative carryover from Wednesday’s hawkish minutes of the Jan 27-28 FOMC meeting, where “several” policymakers suggested the Fed may need to raise interest rates if inflation stays above their goal.  In addition, Thursday’s jump in WTI crude oil by more than +1% to a 6.5-month high lifted inflation expectations, a bearish factor for T-notes. European government bond yields were mixed on Thursday.  The 10-year German bund yield rose +0.4 bp to 2.743%.  The 10-year UK gilt yield fell -0.6 bp to 4.368%. The Eurozone Feb consumer confidence index rose +0.2 to -12.2, weaker than expectations of -12.0. Swaps are discounting a 2% chance of a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at its next policy meeting on March 19. US Stock Movers Chipmakers and AI-infrastructure stocks were under pressure on Thursday, dragging the broader market lower.  Western Digital (WDC) closed down more than -4%, and Seagate Technology Holdings (STX) closed down more than -3%.  Also, Microchip Technology (MCHP), NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI), Intel (INTC), and Texas Instruments (TXN) closed down more than -2%.  In addition, Qualcomm (QCOM), Lam Research (LRCX), Micron Technology (MU), and ASML Holding NV (ASML) closed down more than -1%.

      "content": "Walmart Inc. Q4 2026 Earnings Call Summary Moby Intelligence Thu, February 19, 2026 at 4:33 PM EST 3 min read WMT Walmart Inc. Q4 2026 Earnings Call Summary - Moby Strategic Execution and Operational Drivers Performance was driven by the power of the omnichannel model, with adjusted operating income growing at over twice the rate of sales growth in the fourth quarter, marking the third consecutive year that profit growth outpaced sales growth. Management attributed market share gains to households earning over $100,000, while noting that lower-income wallets remain stretched and focused on convenience alongside price. Strategic positioning is shifting toward 'agentic commerce,' utilizing AI assistants like Sparky to move from traditional search to intent-driven shopping experiences. Operational efficiency improved through supply chain automation, with 60% of U.S. stores now receiving freight from automated distribution centers. The 'build one, scale globally' philosophy is being applied to technology platforms to lower marginal costs and ensure consistent customer experiences across international markets. Inventory management remained a primary driver of health, with levels growing at approximately half the rate of sales due to better visibility from AI and computer vision tools. Outlook and Strategic Assumptions Full-year guidance assumes continued margin expansion driven by a favorable business mix, specifically higher contributions from advertising and membership fees. Management adopted a 'measured approach' to guidance, citing potential macro headwinds such as a hiring recession, student loan delinquencies, and subdued consumer sentiment. The financial framework assumes eCommerce will remain the primary growth driver, with modest increases expected from physical store and club sales. Capital expenditure is expected to peak this year at approximately 3.5% of sales, focused heavily on supply chain automation and store remodels. Guidance incorporates a 100 basis point headwind for the full year due to maximum fair pricing legislation impacting the pharmacy business. Structural Shifts and Risk Factors The acquisition of VIZIO is now fully integrated into the base, with management highlighting its triple-digit advertising growth as a key future revenue stream. A $30 billion share repurchase program was authorized, reflecting management's confidence in consistent multi-year cash flow generation. The organizational structure was realigned in January to move marketplace, advertising, and data services to an enterprise level for global scaling. Management flagged a 300 basis point headwind in the prior year from increased claims expenses and a 'bumpy' tariff environment that they are now lapping.

Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Customers engaging with the Sparky AI assistant show an average order value approximately 35% higher than non-users. Management views AI as a tool to transition from search-based retail to intent-driven commerce, which strengthens digital unit economics through higher conversion. Profitability trajectory of the marketplace and fulfillment services Management is prioritizing growth over immediate marketplace profitability, noting that 52% of sellers now use Walmart Fulfillment Services. The strategy focuses on building a large digital platform where the marginal cost of adding the next percentage of growth is very low. Consumer health and the impact of GLP-1 medications GLP-1 users show increased 'Fresh' category consumption, which typically acts as a double-digit percentage basket driver, making the overall impact 'kind of a wash.' Lower-income consumers are increasingly managing spending 'paycheck to paycheck' and were impacted by shifts in government benefits early in the quarter. Sustainability of high-margin advertising and membership growth Advertising and membership fees represented nearly 1/3 of operating income this quarter, with significant 'runway' remaining compared to best-in-class competitors. The VIZIO acquisition provides a new high-growth channel for advertising that is just beginning to be leveraged across the ecosystem. One stock.

      "content": "GATX Corporation Q4 2025 Earnings Call Summary Moby Intelligence Thu, February 19, 2026 at 4:32 PM EST 3 min read GATX GATX Corporation Q4 2025 Earnings Call Summary - Moby Strategic Integration and Operational Synergy The acquisition of 101,000 railcars from Wells Fargo Rail effectively doubles GATX's North American fleet to 208,000 cars, managed under a single commercial umbrella to provide seamless customer service. Management attributes the 11% EPS growth in 2025 to robust secondary market demand and record performance in the engine leasing segment, which saw its strongest growth to date. The North American rail market is characterized as 'supply-led,' where low new car production and steady scrapping are driving net fleet shrinkage and supporting high utilization. Strategic portfolio optimization is being accelerated by leveraging the expanded fleet size to increase asset disposition gains, targeting $200 million in 2026. Operational efficiencies are being realized by consolidating maintenance providers for the acquired fleet, reducing the shop network from 80 to a smaller group of preferred third-party partners. Engine leasing strength is driven by global supply chain constraints and limited repair capacity, which has increased the value and lease rates of the existing installed base of spare engines. 2026 Outlook and Growth Framework Full-year 2026 EPS guidance of $9.50 to $10.10 assumes a 10% increase, overcoming the typical early-year GAAP dilution associated with large-scale operating lease acquisitions. The Lease Price Index (LPI) for the consolidated North American fleet is expected to remain strong in the high teens to low 20% range, reflecting a solid existing car market. Maintenance expense is projected to rise to $500 million in 2026, primarily due to the added scale of the Wells Fargo fleet and a busy regulatory compliance calendar. Management plans to exercise the first option to increase its equity stake in the Brookfield joint venture by 3.5% in June 2026 for approximately $66 million. The investment pipeline remains active with over $1 billion in planned capital deployment outside of the Wells Fargo transaction, focused on rail assets in North America and International markets. Structural Changes and Risk Factors GATX will consolidate 100% of the new joint venture into its financial statements, with Brookfield's 70% share of earnings deducted as 'net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.' A new $300 million share repurchase authorization was approved to replace the exhausted 2019 program, serving as a tool for returning excess capital after asset investments. The quarterly dividend was increased by 8.2%, a higher step-up than previous years, signaling management's confidence in the cash flow stability of the enlarged franchise. Macroeconomic sensitivity is noted in specific car types like boxcars, which are experiencing more pricing pressure compared to the stable heavy-haul bulk and tank car segments. Story Continues Q&A Session Key Takeaways Our analysts just identified a stock with the potential to be the next Nvidia. Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Secondary market demand and upside to asset sale targets Management noted that the $200 million gain target has a historical variance of $10 million to $15 million depending on the timing of lumpy transactions. The high volume of capital seeking rail investments and the lack of new car supply create a very supportive environment for selling assets from the now-doubled portfolio. Synergy capture and accretion timing for the Wells Fargo fleet The $0.20 to $0.30 accretion projected for 2026 includes management fees of approximately $55 million and early-stage operational synergies. Management expects modest accretion in 2026 and plans to apply its 'cyclically-aware' management philosophy to the acquired portfolio, though they are not yet factoring in significant incremental synergies beyond that first year. Maintenance strategy for the acquired bank-owned fleet Because Wells Fargo was a bank and could not own shops, 100% of their maintenance was third-party; GATX will eventually move some of this work in-house as its own shop capacity expands. Immediate value is being added by applying GATX's mechanical expertise to pair down the number of third-party shops used, driving better pricing and quality control. One stock.

Q4 2025 Earnings Call Summary - Moby Strategic Execution and Market Positioning Achieved 6.2% organic revenue growth in 2025 by aligning services with global megatrends including the energy transition, digitalization, and sustainability requirements. Expanded adjusted EBITDA margins by 300 basis points to 25.9%, significantly exceeding long-term targets through improved laboratory utilization and technology-enabled employee productivity. Navigated geopolitical uncertainties and trade policy shifts by leveraging a diversified global footprint and the essential nature of safety certification services. Executed a strategic realignment of the Software & Advisory segment into 'Risk and Compliance Software' to focus on high-quality digital platforms like ULTRUS. Divested the non-core employee health and safety (EHS) software business for $210 million to concentrate resources on core TIC-aligned software offerings. Integrated technical advisory services into the Industrial segment to better pair specialized expertise with standards-driven testing and certification workflows. Invested $197 million in capital expenditures to expand global testing infrastructure, specifically targeting high-growth sectors like EV batteries, HVAC, and automotive EMC. 2026 Outlook and Strategic Priorities Projecting 2026 consolidated organic revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range, with the Industrial segment expected to outpace the Consumer segment. Targeting adjusted EBITDA margin expansion to a range of 26.5% to 27.0%, driven by continued operating leverage and benefits from the ongoing restructuring program. Anticipating capital expenditures of 7% to 8% of revenue to support new laboratory facilities and match sustained customer demand in emerging technology sectors. Expecting the restructuring plan to be substantially completed by Q1 2027, with an estimated annual operating income improvement of $25 million to $30 million. Forecasting a 2026 effective tax rate of approximately 26%, reflecting the continued implementation of OECD Pillar 2 provisions. Structural Changes and Risk Factors Recorded $37 million in pretax restructuring charges in Q4 2025 as part of a broader plan to exit non-strategic service lines representing approximately 1% of revenue. Increased the regular quarterly dividend by 11.5%, reflecting confidence in robust cash flow generation and a commitment to shareholder returns. Identified a 50 basis point revenue tailwind from forward FX forecasts for 2026, with the majority of the benefit expected in the first half of the year. Noted that Q1 2026 growth may be more modest due to strong prior-year comparisons and the timing of the Lunar New Year holiday in Asia.

Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Margin expansion is underpinned by a continuous improvement philosophy focusing on price, volume, and increased utilization of lab capacity and staff. Approximately 120 basis points of the Q4 2025 margin improvement was attributed to the absence of non-restructuring severance expenses from the prior year. Demand drivers within the data center ecosystem Digitalization trends are driving double-digit growth in data center services as customers require new standards for complex thermal dynamics and high-voltage DC power. Demand spans multiple categories including power automation, renewables, wire and cable, and specialized fire suppression for built environments. Strategic rationale for shifting advisory services to Industrial Management determined advisory services are more tightly coupled with TIC work than software, particularly in energy ecosystems and medical devices. The move aims to capture synergies in project identification and team utilization while allowing the software segment to focus on pure digital product roadmaps. Trends in manufacturing shifts and China exposure Management is not seeing a significant shift out of China but rather a 'China Plus One' strategy where customers add capacity in India, Malaysia, and Thailand. The China business remains strong and continues to grow, albeit at a lower slope compared to emerging manufacturing hubs. One stock.

Executives said its results got a boost from infrastructure spending and investments in building AI data centers. Deere's stock is building on its winning streak. Shares of Deere & Co. ( DE ) jumped nearly 12% to a fresh high Thursday, extending their recent record-setting rally, after the farm and construction equipment maker posted earnings that exceeded expectations. Deere reported earnings per share of $2.42 on revenue that rose 13% year-over-year to $9.61 billion in its fiscal first quarter. Both figures topped analysts' projections compiled by Visible Alpha. More from Yahoo Scout What are Deere's full-year financial outlook projections? What drove Deere's earnings to exceed analyst expectations? Which business segments are driving Deere's recovery prospects? How is AI infrastructure spending impacting Deere's business? Deere's Manager of Investor Communications Chris Seibert said in Thursday's earnings call that infrastructure spending by the Trump administration and data center construction projects helped bolster its results, according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense. Why This Matters to Investors Deere shares have rallied this year amid optimism about a rebound in the company's construction and small ‌agriculture businesses, along with a boost from AI infrastructure spending. \"While the global large agriculture industry continues to experience challenges, we're encouraged by the ongoing recovery in demand within both the construction and small agriculture segments,\" CEO John May said in a statement. Those positive demand trends have the company expecting this year could be \"the bottom of the current cycle\" May said, leaving Deere poised for stronger sales growth in 2027 and beyond. Looking ahead, Deere said it expects net income of $4.5 billion and $5 billion for the full year, up from the previous range of $4 billion to $4.75 billion, and above the $4.43 billion analysts were looking for. The company said sales from its Production & Precision Agriculture segment are seen falling 5% to 10%, while small agriculture and construction sales are projected to rise about 15%. With Thursday's move, Deere shares have gained more than 40% since the start of the year. Read the original article on Investopedia Terms and Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices More Info",

Vestwell is one that’s clearly enjoying the breeze. The New-York based workplace savings fintech just raised $385 million in Series E funding with Blue Owl Capital and Sixth Street Growth leading the round. The haul more than doubled Vestwell’s total fundraising to $660 million, with participation from new and existing investors including Neuberger Berman, Morgan Stanley and Franklin Templeton. The infusion will be used, in the words of the firm, to expand distribution “across all channels where income is earned and benefits are delivered.” So, it’s leaving its options open. “We’re focused on an ambitious goal to close the $50 trillion savings gap in America,” Vestwell founder and CEO Aaron Schumm said in a statement. “This capital allows us to move faster on the work that matters most.” SUBSCRIBE: Receive more of our free Advisor Upside newsletter.

The financing doubles Vestwell’s valuation since its 2023 Series D funding round, according to the announcement, and the firm has surpassed $200 million in annual recurring revenue. Its platform already covers millions of savers: More than 2 million active savers are using Vestwell-powered programs. More than $50 billion in assets administered across workplace, institutional and government channels. “The financing reflects investor confidence in Vestwell’s role as the infrastructure layer for how Americans save,” Schumm added. “It reflects strong confidence from leading investors in our unified savings platform and our ability to scale across payroll, partners and products.” The AI Angle. Schumm said the funding will support AI-driven capabilities and extend savings pathways beyond retirement by embedding Vestwell’s services more deeply into payroll, benefits platforms, financial institutions and government-led public programs. The company is also expanding access to professionally managed investments that go beyond age-based defaults.. “Vestwell has built a resilient platform with strong underlying economics and a clear path for continued expansion,” said Tim DeGrange, a principal of Blue Owl Capital. “Vestwell is building long-term infrastructure for the savings ecosystem, enabled for today’s age of AI.” This post first appeared on The Daily Upside .

How to use it wisely Jing Pan Thu, February 19, 2026 at 4:17 PM CST 7 min read GC=F WLTH ^GSPC Saul Loeb / Getty Images Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below. With tax season now underway, working Americans may soon see a financial windfall, according to President Donald Trump — and he says it’s all due to one piece of legislation. “Tax Refunds this year, because of ‘THE GREAT BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL,’ are substantially greater than ever before,” Trump wrote in a recent post on Truth Social (1). “In some cases, estimates are that over 20% will be returned to the Taxpayer.” Top Picks Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP Most Americans earn a dismal 0.39% APY on their cash at big banks. Unlock up to 4.05% APY and pay $0 in account fees instead with a Wealthfront Cash Account Trump also urged Americans to recognize what he described as the benefits of the legislation. “So, when you get your Tax Refund, think about what a wonderful President you have — NO TAX ON TIPS, NO TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY FOR OUR GREAT SENIORS, NO TAX ON OVERTIME, INTEREST DEDUCTIONS ON CAR LOANS AND MUCH MORE,” he wrote. While the message may sound promotional, experts do expect refund amounts to trend higher this season. A study by investment firm Piper Sandler projects that refunds could average about $1,000 higher than usual this year — with some taxpayers potentially seeing refunds of an extra $10,000 or more (2). Meanwhile, the Tax Foundation has estimated that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act reduced individual taxes by $129 billion for 2025, noting that refunds “will undoubtedly rise for millions of taxpayers” this season (3). According to the IRS, taxpayers generally have until April 15 to file their returns (4). Those who file electronically and opt for direct deposit typically receive refunds within three weeks (5). Still, Trump offered a characteristically simple piece of advice to taxpayers expecting a larger check. “Don’t spend all of this money in one place!” he wrote. For many households, that raises an immediate question: What’s the smartest way to use a sudden cash infusion? Whether you’re thinking about shoring up your finances, preparing for uncertainty or putting that extra money to work, here are a few ways Americans may consider investing their potential windfall. ‘The best thing to do,’ according to Warren Buffett The U.S. stock market has been a powerful engine of wealth creation. Trump has pointed to that strength, recently saying that “the only thing that’s really going up big? It’s the stock market and your 401(k)s (6).” Story Continues The benchmark S&P 500 returned 16% in 2025 and has gained roughly 75% over the past five years. Of course, consistently picking winning stocks isn’t easy. That’s why legendary investor Warren Buffett argues that most people don’t need to pick individual companies at all to benefit from the stock market’s long-term growth. “In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is own the S&P 500 index fund,” Buffett has famously stated (7). This approach gives investors exposure to 500 of America’s largest companies across a wide range of industries, providing instant diversification without the need for constant monitoring or active trading. The beauty of this approach is its accessibility — anyone, regardless of wealth, can take advantage of it. Even small amounts can grow over time with tools like Acorns , a popular app that automatically invests your spare change. Signing up for Acorns takes just minutes: Link your cards and Acorns will round up each purchase to the nearest dollar, investing the difference — your spare change — into a diversified portfolio. With Acorns, you can invest in an S&P 500 ETF with as little as $5 — and, if you sign up today with a recurring deposit, Acorns will add a $20 bonus to help you begin your investment journey.

Read More: Non-millionaires can now invest in this $1B private real estate fund starting at just $10 Protect your wealth with a time-tested safe haven If a larger refund is headed your way, putting a portion into hard assets that have stood the test of time could be a strategic move — especially in uncertain economic environments. As Ray Dalio, founder of the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, recently said , “the most important thing is to have a well-diversified portfolio.” And when it comes to hedging against “bad times,” he has repeatedly pointed to one asset in particular: gold. In an interview with CNBC, Dalio said that “people don't have, typically, an adequate amount of gold in their portfolio,” adding that “when bad times come, gold is a very effective diversifier.” Gold has long been considered a go-to safe haven. It can’t be printed out of thin air like fiat money and because it’s not tied to any single currency or economy, investors often flock to it during periods of economic turmoil or geopolitical uncertainty, driving up its value. Despite a recent pullback, gold prices have climbed more than 70% over the past 12 months. Other prominent voices see further potential. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently said that in this environment, gold can “easily” rise to $10,000 an ounce. One way to invest in gold that also provides significant tax advantages is to open a gold IRA with the help of Priority Gold . Gold IRAs allow investors to hold physical gold or gold-related assets within a retirement account, thereby combining the tax advantages of an IRA with the protective benefits of investing in gold , making it an option for those looking to help shield their retirement funds against economic uncertainties. When you make a qualifying purchase with Priority Gold, you can receive up to $10,000 in precious metals for free. Let your cash hatch its own income You don’t need a massive investment portfolio to start building wealth. Even your spare cash — such as a tax refund — can earn income, rather than sitting idle in a low-yield account. To get started, a high-yield account like a Wealthfront Cash Account can be a great place to grow your emergency funds, offering both competitive interest rates and easy access to your cash when you need it. A Wealthfront Cash Account currently offers a base variable APY of 3.30% and new clients can get a 0.75% boost during their first three months on up to $150,000 for a total APY of 4.05% . That’s ten times the national deposit savings rate, according to the FDIC’s January report. With no minimum balances or account fees, as well as 24/7 withdrawals and free domestic wire transfers, your funds remain accessible at all times. Plus, Wealthfront Cash Account balances of up to $8 million are insured by the FDIC through program banks. Get expert guidance At the end of the day, everyone’s financial situation is different — from income levels and investment goals to debt obligations and risk tolerance — which means the best move for someone else might not be the best move for you. If you’re unsure where to start, it might be the right time to get in touch with a financial advisor through Advisor.com. Advisor.com is an online platform that matches you with vetted financial advisors suited to your unique needs. They can help tailor a strategy to your particular financial situation, whether you’re looking to grow wealth, diversify beyond stocks or plan for long-term financial security.

      "content": "Do You Earn More Than Your Peers In 2026? Here's The Average Income By Age in The U.S. Ryan Peterson Thu, February 19, 2026 at 4:01 PM CST 4 min read Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Quick Summary Earnings tend to rise through your 20s and 30s, peak in your early 40s, and decline as you approach retirement, making it important to understand how your income compares to others in your age group. Workers who want help translating income benchmarks into a long-term financial plan can use SmartAsset's free matching tool to connect with up to three financial advisors and compare options before making major savings decisions. The median full-time worker in the U.S. earned $63,180 per year in the third quarter of 2025, up 4.2% from the year before. But that number does not tell you much about whether you are on track for your age. Earnings rise sharply in your 20s and 30s, peak in your early 40s, and then begin to decline as people approach retirement. Where you fall on that curve matters, as it affects how much you should be saving, how aggressively you can invest, and whether you need to rethink your career trajectory. It is also the kind of benchmark many workers review alongside broader retirement projections, often with the help of financial planning tools like SmartAsset , which connects individuals with financial advisors to evaluate long-term strategy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks median earnings by age group, and the data shows clear patterns. People aged 16 to 19 earn a median of $32,344 per year, mostly from part-time or seasonal jobs. By ages 20 to 24, that jumps to $41,392 as more people enter the workforce full-time. That is a 28% increase, but still well below what older workers earn. The biggest jump happens between your early 20s and early 30s. Workers aged 25 to 34 earn a median of $59,800, a 44% increase from the 20-24 age group. This is when most people finish school, move beyond entry-level roles, and begin building specialized skills. If you are in your late 20s and still earning close to what you made right out of college, that is a signal to negotiate harder, switch jobs, or invest in training that leads to higher pay. Earnings continue climbing into your 30s and early 40s. The 35-44 age group has a median income of $72,020, the highest of any bracket. These are peak earning years for most workers. You have experience, credibility, and upward mobility. After 45, earnings begin to flatten and then decline. Workers aged 45 to 54 earn a median of $71,604. By ages 55 to 64, the median drops to $68,744. Some of that shift is voluntary. Others move into less demanding roles or reduce hours. But some of it is structural. Older workers who lose jobs often struggle to replace income at the same level. Story Continues For people 65 and older who are still working full-time, median income falls to $62,036. Some continue working by choice. Others remain because they cannot afford to retire. These numbers are medians, meaning half earn more and half earn less. They exclude part-time workers, unemployed individuals, and income from investments or side businesses. There is also a clear gender gap. Men aged 35 to 44 earn a median of $1,504 per week, while women in the same bracket earn $1,226, a 23% difference. The highest earning window is relatively short. Ages 35 to 54 provide the most income potential, and that span lasts only about 20 years. Waiting until your 50s to prioritize retirement savings means missing much of your peak earning capacity. Even small delays in contributing can reduce retirement balances by hundreds of thousands of dollars over time. But knowing whether you are on track is not always obvious. Savings rates, taxes, investment allocation, and career decisions all interact in complex ways. That is where professional guidance can help. SmartAsset's free matching tool connects you with up to three financial advisors based on location, asset level, and financial goals. After answering a short questionnaire, you can compare advisors side by side. Initial consultations are typically free, and there is no obligation to hire. For workers unsure whether their income and savings trajectory align with retirement goals, SmartAsset can provide a structured starting point . Income alone does not determine financial security. Someone earning $72,000 in their 40s who saves 15% is in stronger shape than someone earning $90,000 who saves nothing. Benchmarks provide context, but they do not replace a savings plan. If you are earning more than your peers but spending it all, you are not ahead.  For workers who want clarity on whether their earnings today translate into security tomorrow, comparing options through SmartAsset's advisor platform can help turn income data into an actionable plan. Check out the breakdown below to see how your income stacks up against others in your age group. Age Range Median Salary 16 to 19 $32,344 20 to 24 $41,392 25 to 34 $59,800 35 to 44 $72,020 45 to 54 $71,604 55 to 64 $68,744 65+ $62,036 Image: Imagn This article Do You Earn More Than Your Peers In 2026?

      "content": "Is bitcoin's price slump an investing opportunity? Here's how to buy bitcoin. Yahoo Personal Finance · NurPhoto via Getty Images Rachel Christian Thu, February 19, 2026 at 4:22 PM CST 11 min read Bitcoin ’s price volatility has been on full display in recent months. But many investors see price slumps as a buying opportunity — not an exit sign. If you want to purchase bitcoin , there’s good news. It’s no longer a chaotic financial frontier experiment — it’s fast, regulated, and integrated into institutional finance. New to bitcoin? Here’s everything you need to know. How to buy bitcoin in 2026 There are several ways to buy bitcoin. You can go through a crypto exchange, a fintech app, or a traditional brokerage that will allow you to buy into a bitcoin ETF. Before placing a trade, though, decide what you actually want: full ownership of your bitcoin and private keys — or easy price exposure inside a familiar, regulated system. Whichever avenue you take, it’s important to remember that bitcoin remains a high-risk, highly volatile asset compared to many other investments. Prices can surge or drop quickly, sometimes without warning. If you’re considering buying bitcoin, assume volatility is part of the deal. Step 1: Choose where to buy bitcoin Where you purchase your bitcoin determines your costs, your level of control, and how smoothly you can move, store, and manage your assets. Centralized crypto exchanges Centralized exchanges are platforms designed specifically for digital assets. They offer the widest range of features, including the ability to withdraw your bitcoin to your own private wallet, which dedicated crypto traders consider key. There are dozens of crypto exchanges, and most offer simple interfaces designed for new investors, as well as advanced tools for more experienced traders. You should choose one with a strong track record of protecting customer funds, along with solid regulation and reliable customer support. Coinbase remains the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., with an interface designed to be as intuitive as a banking app. It offers built-in educational resources that reward you with small amounts of crypto. Kraken and Gemini are two other major exchanges. All three are based in the U.S. and offer a wide selection of cryptocurrencies (Coinbase alone offers more than 375 coins). Trading apps and payment apps If you already have Robinhood, PayPal, or Cash App, you can buy bitcoin through the app. Convenience is the big win here. There’s no new password to create, and in most cases, no need to wait for a bank transfer to clear because your account is already funded. Popular financial apps that offer bitcoin include: Robinhood PayPal Venmo Cash App Webull Public Robinhood has become a heavyweight in crypto by offering \"zero-commission\" trading. However, don’t be fooled — zero-commission isn’t truly free. Robinhood and its competitor Webull make money through a gap between the market price and what you pay, which is known as the spread. As of July 24, 2025, Robinhood earns about $0.85 for every $100 in crypto trades routed to its market maker — roughly 0.85% of the trade amount. That built-in cost will be reflected in the price you pay when buying or selling bitcoin. With PayPal and Venmo, you’ll pay a 2.2% fee for trades involving less than $75 worth of bitcoin, with the fee dropping as the order size increases. You may pay additional fees to cash out or transfer your assets to an external wallet. With Cash App, you’ll pay a flat fee of $0.49 to $1.49 for orders up to $100, then the fee structure switches to between 1% and 2% for orders totaling $100 to $5,000. A drawback of fintech apps used to be limited control over moving your bitcoin to a private wallet without cashing out first. However, in 2026, several platforms — including Cash App, Robinhood, and Public — now allow bitcoin transfers to external wallets. Bitcoin ETFs If you have an IRA or a standard brokerage account, you can now buy \"shares\" of bitcoin just like you buy shares of Apple or an S&P 500 index fund. In January 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission gave bitcoin ETFs the green light , and since then, investors have poured billions into the funds: Roughly $110 billion flowed into a dozen different bitcoin ETFs during the first year alone, according to the Wall Street Journal. Bitcoin ETFs allow retail investors who are new to crypto to gain exposure without a dedicated wallet, private keys, or a centralized exchange. They let you trade bitcoin like a stock through your existing brokerage. You buy shares in a fund — managed by firms such as BlackRock and Fidelity — that holds the actual bitcoin for you. The ETF’s price tracks the coin's price movements directly, offering the simplest, most hands-off way to buy bitcoin. Holding bitcoin ETFs inside a traditional or Roth IRA also comes with powerful tax advantages: tax-deferred or even tax-free growth. You’ll also avoid capital gains tax and the hassle of managing wallets or private keys. The catch? You’ll pay an annual fee to the company managing the ETF, known as an expense ratio (typically around 0.25% to 0.40%). If you invest in bitcoin through an ETF, you don’t actually own bitcoin — you own shares in a fund that does. Step 2: Create your account and verify your identity After picking your platform, you’ll go through the account setup process. It’s designed to be relatively painless and should take just a few minutes. If you’re opening a new account to buy your bitcoin, you’ll need to confirm your identity with information including your name, address, and Social Security number. If you’re buying bitcoin through an app in which you already have an account, you can go straight to investing. The Know Your Customer process KYC is the identity check financial platforms use to verify who you are and comply with anti-fraud and anti-money laundering laws. Most will ask for a photo of a government ID (driver’s license or passport) and a quick selfie. Modern verification systems match your face to the ID in real time. Thanks to automated verification, most people are approved and ready to buy within minutes. While no-KYC platforms still exist, they offer fewer protections — so they’re best for beginners to avoid. Step 3: Fund your account Now that your account is live, you need to move some traditional currency — like U.S. dollars — onto the platform. You have several ways to do this. ACH bank transfer : Generally, this is the most common option. It's usually free, but funds can take three to five business days to fully clear. Many platforms let you buy right away, though you may not be able to withdraw until the transfer settles. Debit card or credit card : This is the fastest option — your purchase happens instantly. The downside is higher fees (often 3% or more). Wire transfer : This is best for large deposits, typically clears within 24 hours, and allows higher limits. PayPal or Apple Pay: Convenient and quick, this method is usually more expensive than a standard bank transfer. Step 4: Buy your bitcoin Once your account is funded, you’re ready to buy your first bitcoin. Most platforms give you two main order options. A market order is a “buy now” option. You choose how much to spend, and the platform instantly buys bitcoin at the current price. A limit order is another approach that lets you set the exact price you’re willing to pay. If bitcoin is $65,000 and you only want to buy at $62,000, your order will not be executed until the price drops to that level. For beginners with long-term investing in mind, the tried-and-true strategy of dollar-cost averaging works just as well for bitcoin as it does for other investments. Many apps let you automate recurring buys — for example, $50 every week on Tuesdays. This removes the stress of timing the market and helps smooth out your average purchase price over time. Step 5: Keep your bitcoin safe Buying bitcoin is one thing, but keeping it safe is perhaps the most",

What this transaction means for investors Hess Midstream is recognized for generating steady income in the energy sector, valued for converting pipeline volumes into consistent cash distributions. This stability relies on reliable throughput and disciplined balance sheet management. Hess Midstream owns and operates pipelines, gas processing plants, storage facilities, and export terminals that transport oil and natural gas from production sites to market. Its revenue is primarily fee-based and supported by long-term agreements with producers, which provides visibility into cash flow. Unlike upstream companies, its profitability does not depend on oil price fluctuations. Instead, its value proposition centers on stable throughput, disciplined capital spending, and the ability to convert operating cash flow into consistent distributions. Story Continues Investors should monitor the company’s cash flow coverage of distributions and the stability of its volumes. If cash flow continues to support distributions and debt remains controlled, Hess Midstream remains attractive as an income-focused infrastructure investment. The balance between dependable fee-based cash flow and upstream production activity shapes the stock’s risk and return profile. Should you buy stock in Hess Midstream right now?

      "content": "Asset Sales, debt reduction and gas growth mark some Q4 E&P moves Oil & Gas 360 Thu, February 19, 2026 at 4:30 PM CST 1 min read SM NG=F OXY (By Oil & Gas 360) – Capital discipline continues to define strategy across the U.S. energy sector. Asset Sales, debt reduction and gas growth mark Q4 E&P moves- oil and gas 3600 SM Energy announced an agreement to sell its South Texas assets to Caturus Energy for $950 million, further streamlining its portfolio and reinforcing liquidity. The transaction reflects an industry trend toward concentrating capital in core operating areas while monetizing non-core positions. Occidental Petroleum reported a strong quarter and highlighted progress on debt reduction following the sale of its OxyChem business. Strengthening the balance sheet remains a priority for the company as it positions itself to manage commodity price volatility while maintaining shareholder returns. Expand Energy also posted solid fourth-quarter results and outlined plans to increase natural gas production in 2026. The growth target signals confidence in longer-term gas fundamentals, particularly as U.S. LNG export capacity expands and power generation demand remains resilient. Collectively, the announcements point to a sector focused less on aggressive expansion and more on capital efficiency, balance sheet strength, and selective growth tied to durable demand trends. In an environment of moderated oil prices and repositioning natural gas markets, operators appear committed to financial resilience and measured execution rather than rapid production growth.

      "content": "2 Incredibly Cheap Dividend Stocks to Buy Now Eric Volkman, The Motley Fool Thu, February 19, 2026 at 4:01 PM CST 4 min read ^GSPC EPD BMY It isn't easy to find bargains on the stock market these days. According to a recent analysis by FactSet , the average forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) for the S&P 500 index currently stands at 21.5, which is notably above the 17.6 ratio it stood at 10 years ago. So it's gotten a bit tougher to find good choices in the big haystack of equities out there, but there are still some needles in this haystack worth considering. Even better, a few of them pay generous dividends. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks » Here's a brief look at two of these discounted stocks, Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) and Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) , and why they are worth considering at the moment. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Enterprise Products Partners Enterprise Products Partners is a large midstream energy company that operates an enviable portfolio of assets, from pipelines to storage facilities to deepwater docks. All things being equal, the midstream segment of the energy sector is steadier than the upstream (exploration and production) and downstream (retail) segments. That's because it tends to operate on long-term contracts and facilitates the movement of energy assets, rather than extracting them from the earth or selling their end products. With that advantage, Enterprise has been consistently profitable, with net margins generally coming in a bit over 10%. Strong operating cash flow leaves plenty of room not only for dividend payments, but also for significant capital expenditures to help widen the company's revenue base. This year, for instance, it'll spend anywhere from $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion for this purpose. Despite a recent rally in Enterprise's share price, the stock is still surprisingly inexpensive and trades at a forward P/E just above 13. That works out to a dividend yield of just under 5.9%, which is more than five times the average of all S&P 500 index components. 2. Bristol Myers Squibb A business transformation is never easy, especially in the capital-intensive pharmaceutical industry. For years, Bristol Myers lived well on a pair of blockbuster drugs -- multiple myeloma treatment Revlimid and blood thinner Eliquis. Yet Eliquis is fast approaching its patent cliff, and last month, Revlimid tumbled off it entirely. These days, the two medications are bundled into the company's so-called \"legacy\" portfolio -- its collection of drugs that are no longer the revenue-increasing powerhouses they once were. At the same time, it's pumping up its fresher \"growth\" portfolio -- anchored by cancer treatment Opdivo -- of drugs shielded by patents or other legal protections. In its fourth quarter of 2025, the latter's revenue rose 16% year over year. Story continues However, that was mitigated by the legacy portfolio's 15% decline, and the still-considerable size of that collection is weighing on Bristol Myers stock. Combined, total revenue only inched up by 1% year over year in said quarter, and that's not the kind of robust improvement investors expect of Big Pharma these days. Bristol Myers' shares remain a bargain play on that yet-to-be-completed transformation; its forward P/E sits below 10. That's unforgivably cheap for a big pharma player with a growing collection of blockbuster drugs, not to mention a frequent dividend raiser with a payout that currently yields a generous 4.2%.

Griffin’s Citadel added approximately $2.52 billion worth of Amazon ( AMZN ) stock , taking its position to more than $3.2 billion , per its latest 13F filing. The hedge fund also doubled its stake in AI bellwether Nvidia ( NVDA ) , cementing a position that’s worth nearly $4 billion . The massive bets clearly point to Griffin wanting more exposure to the relentless AI arms race. Amazon stock has wobbled of late, on the back of its aggressive $200 billion capital spending plan linked to AI. For perspective, the stock is down 11.3% year to date , and more than 14% in the past month. However, from a fundamental standpoint, Amazon continues to impress, spearheaded by a healthy AI-powered backlog and its robust cloud sales. Even with investors getting spooked about AI, the data still point to healthy demand that remains as solid as ever. For perspective, Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater also piled into Nvidia, a massive $253 million bet , adding roughly 1.35 million shares , which took its total stake to nearly $721 million at year-end. On top of that, billionaire investor David Tepper has been shopping in tech, with Appaloosa putting millions to work in Micron, Google, and Meta Platforms. Griffin remains unfazed by the volatility in tech and is positioning Citadel for what this year could look like if AI spending effectively turns from promise into profits.

Ken Griffin is considered one of the most prolific investors of the past five decades, having grown Citadel into a global hedge fund juggernaut. Things started off modestly for Griffin, trading from his Harvard dorm room back in the mid-1980s and applying quantitative models to guide his bets. He later launched his first fund in 1987 and efficiently navigated the “ Black Monday ” crash with considerable aplomb through well-timed short positions. More Fund Managers: Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater invests $253 million in major AI stock JPMorgan builds $2.93 billion stake in health care stock Jim Simons’ Renaissance drops $520 million on surging tech stock Griffin officially founded Citadel in the 1990s and grew its presence across stocks, fixed income, and commodities, quickly turning the hedge fund into a dominant market-leading operation. Story Continues Citadel has also consistently shared its success with clients when performance is strong, rather than simply allowing the fund to swell in size. For perspective, in December 2025 , reports showed that Citadel effectively planned to return nearly $5 billion of 2025 profits to its investors in early 2026 , Investing.com reported. With that payout cleared, the firm was expected to begin 2026 with nearly $67 billion in assets under management , down from $72 billion before the distribution. Moreover, at a personal level, Griffin consistently ranks among the richest individuals on Wall Street , boasting a net worth of nearly $49.6 billion , according to Forbes .

Amazon stock took a big hit following its most recent earnings report, which prompted investors to fixate on a single eye-popping $200 billion capex number. Of late, investors are in “show me” mode with AI, putting Amazon and other tech players under duress. Related: Moody’s delivers blunt 6-word verdict on economy However, Griffin’s looking at the bigger picture with Amazon continuing to impress on the fundamentals side. Amazon posted a whopping $716.9 billion in 2025 net sales , up 12%, with $80 billion in operating income . Its cloud service in AWS alone is delivering a tremendous $128.7 billion in revenue , surging 20%, with an eye-catching $45.6 billion in operating income to boot. Amazon’s free cash flow has tightened as well, hovering at around $11 billion , but with AWS’s backlog at around $244 billion , it’s clear that demand is still there. And Amazon wasn’t the only major mega-cap AI stock Griffin leaned into. Citadel also expanded its Nvidia position by a sizeable margin, now worth nearly $4 billion , even with the stock facing weakness. In a recent piece, TheStreet tech expert Vuk Zdinjak notes that Bank of America remains bullish on Nvidia stock, reiterating a buy rating and a $275 price target . BofA’s Vivek Arya argues that despite the stock’s recent wobbles, Nvidia remains at the heart of the hyperscaler spending boom, lifting AI data-center addressable market estimates to a whopping $1.4 trillion by 2030.

The Facebook ​parent declined to comment. Meta and other Big Tech companies are competing to outbuild each other with massive data centers to get ahead in Silicon Valley's heated AI race. The social media company said ‌in January that it ⁠expected capital expenditure for 2026 to be between $115 billion and $135 billion. Meta has slashed equity-based awards for ⁠the bulk of its employees for the second year in a row, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. Last ​year, the ​company had cut the stock ​award by roughly 10%, ‌which shocked some staff at the time, the FT report said. Meta last month laid off about 10% of employees within its Reality Labs group, which had about 15,000 workers, as the company redirects resources from some of its virtual reality products ‌to wearables. The unit — which has accumulated ​more than $70 billion in losses since ​2021 — includes Meta's ambitious \"metaverse\" ​bet. Meta is building several gigawatt-scale data centers across ‌the United States, including one ​in rural Louisiana, ​a project President Donald Trump said would cost $50 billion.

      "content": "Trump’s Energy Dominance Clashes with Soaring Bills at Home Irina Slav Thu, February 19, 2026 at 4:00 PM MST 5 min read NG=F The Trump Administration could face an energy dilemma ahead of the midterm elections. The U.S. energy dominance agenda and booming LNG exports – pillars of the Administration’s policy – are boosting domestic natural gas demand and raising American energy bills. U.S. LNG exports are hitting record highs , and are set to continue setting records in the coming months and years as new plants are being commissioned, built, and approved, with the strong backing of the Trump Administration. However, soaring demand for feedgas from the export facilities is putting upward pressure on residential gas prices in the United States and on power prices, too, since the power sector is the top domestic gas consumer. Industry is the second-largest user of natural gas, while feedgas for LNG exports has now climbed to third, having outpaced residential gas use in recent years. Record Gas Output, Soaring LNG Exports The U.S. is estimated to have exported 15.0 billion cubic feet per day of LNG last year, up by over 25% from 2024, per data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) in its latest Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO). LNG exports are set to continue rising to an annual average of 16.4 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) this year, and further up to 18.1 Bcf/d in 2027, according to the EIA’s estimates. Higher natural gas demand and prices are set to incentivize more drilling in the gas-directed shale basins Haynesville and Appalachia, while associated gas output from the Permian basin’s oil production is also set to rise as the increasing gas-to-oil ratio (GOR) will drive natural gas production growth despite wobbling oil prices. As a result of these factors, total U.S. natural gas production is set to reach record highs in 2026 and 2027, the EIA reckons . U.S. natural gas marketed production will increase by 2% to average 120.8 Bcf/d in 2026 and then further rise by another 1% to a record-high 122.3 Bcf/d in 2027, according to the administration. Appalachia, the Permian, and the Haynesville basins will drive this production growth. So far, so good. Higher prices will drive higher production, which, in turn, could ease the upward pressure on gas and electricity prices. However, the slight rise in supply faces soaring feedgas demand from LNG export facilities and surging demand for gas-fired generation to meet the power-hungry Big Tech firms and their plans to accelerate data center build-out. The U.S. sees unprecedented power demand growth—AI infrastructure, data centers, and advanced manufacturing are driving the first meaningful growth in U.S. power consumption since the 1990s. The growth is set to average about 2% each year over the next decade, making new electricity generation capacity critical to supporting the advance in AI and the onshoring of manufacturing. 繼續閱讀 And natural gas would play a critical role in meeting part of this increase in power generation. “Natural gas will benefit significantly from the rising electricity demand and the requirement for 24/7 uninterrupted supply. It is most flexible among all energy sources and an abundant domestic resource,” Goldman Sachs said in a report last year. With steadfast support and favorable pro-fossil fuel policies of the Trump Administration, gas will be a winner in the U.S. power demand surge. Structurally Higher Gas Prices But the more prominent role of gas would drive higher prices, which are already filtering down to wholesale and consumer prices. Average wholesale day-ahead electricity prices at most major trading hubs in the Lower 48 states rose in 2025 compared to 2024, driven largely by higher natural gas prices to electric generators, the EIA says . The rising energy bills will not see a relief, at least not this year, as booming LNG exports are intensifying competition for America’s domestic gas output. Exporters can afford higher benchmark gas prices in the U.S. more easily than other domestic consumers, because the LNG export price at which they sell their LNG cargoes abroad is currently about double the Henry Hub price, Reuters columnist Gavin Maguire argues . The continued growth in LNG exports could further tighten the gas supply for U.S.-based consumers, including industry, power generators, and residential customers. This could be a thorny issue for the Trump Administration in the midterm elections this year as retail customers could vote with their wallets and express dissatisfaction that they haven’t seen President Trump’s campaign promise to “slash energy bills” fulfilled. Beyond the near-term prospects of U.S. natural gas demand and prices, long-term projections are not in favor of the U.S. consumer, either. According to Wood Mackenzie, the LNG export growth and the data center boom will boost U.S. gas demand by nearly 40% in the next 10 years , lifting domestic Henry Hub prices to an average US$4.9/MMbtu, or 15 euros per MWh, in the 2030-2035 period. This would be an almost 50% jump compared to 2025 levels, WoodMac noted, and concluded, “Effectively, US LNG supply growth will come at a cost to US consumers and benefit those in Europe.” By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com U.S. Attacks Alleged Drug Boats as Venezuela Oil Crackdown Escalates Libya Awards Fuel Supply Deals To Western Firms, Aims To Cut Russian Imports U.S. to Redirect Venezuelan Oil Royalties Into a Treasury-Controlled Fund Oilprice Intelligence brings you the signals before they become front-page news.

      "content": "This private credit fund just suspended withdrawals — is it a warning for the economy? Noah Weidner Thu, February 19, 2026 at 4:30 PM MST 5 min read Wall Street doesn't know whether it should love or be afraid of private credit. By the time it finds out, it might be too late. Since its popularization after the pandemic, institutional investors ' new favorite asset class has had quite the splash. Dozens of investment firms have made a modest fortune cutting out banks and offering an alternative directly to both borrowers and lenders. Only, the riskier profile of private credit has proven to be a quarrelsome thing. As \"shadow banks\" are not restrained by the same regulations as actual banks, many have turned up risk and shrugged off rigorous underwriting in search of deals — many of which are being sold to other investors for a healthy fee. The result has been some pretty fantastic failures. That's especially the case in the auto industry, where a number of high-profile failures shook up the financial sector in November. The failure of First Brands Group, for example, cost non-bank lenders over $1 billion. Those risks were cast aside in January as CNBC reported that many non-bank lenders raised multi-billion-dollar follow-on rounds . Perhaps, in their mind, the risk was one of the features of a private credit vehicle. It's easy to say that when you think you can get your money back. As some investors in Blue Owl Capital Corp II (OBDC II) are finding right now, that's not always a given. Blue Owl suspends withdrawals On Wednesday, the $1.7 billion investment vehicle permanently restricted withdrawals from OBDC II, a private credit investment vehicle which primarily focused on \"US middle-market companies.\" It primarily did this by originating senior secured, floating-rate credit to software and tech firms. The decision comes after the ailing fund faced over $150 million of redemption requests over nine months, during which the firm is alleged in one class action lawsuit to have misled investors about risks to its asset base, stressing that there was \"no meaningful pressure.\" In reality, there were. The firm then controversially attempted to roll the struggling OBDC II into a larger, publicly traded fund operated by itself. However, shareholders revolted as they realized they would take a 20% haircut. That proposal was quickly shelved, while the firm continued to allow withdrawals. But with redemptions rising, exacerbated in part by fears that AI will consume the sort of imperiled businesses that shadow banks lent to, Blue Owl has pressed the pause button and will now pursue a full liquidation of the fund. It took a step towards winding down OBDC II by selling $600 million in assets from OBDC II, about 30% of the fund's worth. Those investments were sold, per the Financial Times , for roughly what they were worth. And while that's sure to settle some fears that the private credit risk rooster is coming to roost, there's little consolation for anybody, bar maybe the borrowers who got cash for their business (and the companies charging the fees for access to the credit, of course). Story Continues Risks may vary For lenders, a liquidation isn't going to make up for the pittance of performance. Reuters' Jonathan Guilford likened the situation to the fall-off in nontraded REITs after the pandemic. Those assets, to this day, have not recovered to their former levels. But one fund is still one fund, so to generalize the problem with Blue Owl (which is having problems across more than this one fund, but has continued to examine big data center-focused deals with Meta and Oracle, for example) might be a little preemptive. At a minimum, it points to some serious liquidity issues. If we get to the core of the problem here, what's at stake is whether shadow banking offers the benefits it says it does. If lenders (who provide the money to the investors to invest) don't get great returns or have worries about the sector, that could end up being a problem which compounds. How Did the Market React? Private credit flubs generally invite reappraisal of the sector and whether or not the gravy train will continue to print. That is, if the risk is worth the returns. Today, that question is stoking carnage among the private credit crop: Blue Owl fell over 9% intraday, joined by declines from other alternative investment managers like Blackstone , Apollo Global Management , KKR , and Carlyle . But is it an existential problem? While economist Mohamed Aly El-Erian is making headlines warning about a \"canary-in-the-coalmine\" situation in private credit similar to Aug. 2007, it feels too early to decisively say whether the scale of the problem will be disruptive enough to shake the entire economy. There has been a concentration of private credit failures in the auto industry, for instance. However, those issues have not been systemic enough to cause non-banks or other financial institutions to fail. Instead, portfolios have taken the hit, offering the industry a lesson about underwriting. Of course, you have to remember that a feature of private credit funds is risk; these \"cockroaches\", as they call them, might just be part of the product. Ultimately, it remains to be seen if these issues are more pervasive and far-reaching than with this one fund. If, for example, the problems with this $1.7 billion investment vehicle were representative of the whole private credit industry? Well, then we might have a problem.

Both types of companies make good additions. The former offers you a combination of security and growth, while the latter often offers you innovation at a bargain price. Right now, let's talk about future winners. And the perfect place to find them is in the biotech industry. Here, companies are working on amazing techniques to treat and even cure various diseases. In many cases, these players could skyrocket once they reach their goals -- and even as they hit milestones along the way. Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » Let's check out two exciting biotech stocks that may climb 58% and 200%, according to Wall Street. Image source: Getty Images. 1. CRISPR Therapeutics CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CRSP) reached a major goal in recent years: It won approval in 2023 of its first gene editing treatment , Casgevy for blood disorders. This marked an important moment because it was the world's first approval of a CRISPR-based gene editing therapy and demonstrated the ability of this technology to treat disease. CRISPR gene editing involves the cutting of DNA and the leveraging of a natural repair process to fix a faulty gene. Because the technique repairs genes responsible for disease, it acts as a functional cure -- this makes it a true game changer. Casgevy's launch took time, due to the months-long treatment process, but trends are positive: In the fourth quarter, Casgevy generated $54 million in revenue, and for the full year, it brought in $116 million. The company expects readouts from clinical trials spanning various disease indications this year, suggesting there may be several catalysts for stock performance just ahead. For example, CRISPR Therapeutics aims to release updates on zugo-cel in autoimmune diseases, as well as on CTX310 for a condition that may lead to heart disease. I also like the fact that CRISPR Therapeutics has more than $1.9 billion in cash so that it may support the development of its pipeline. Wall Street expects this stock to climb 58% over the coming 12 months, making now a great time to pick up shares of this biotech innovator . 2. Viking Therapeutics Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX) hasn't yet commercialized a product, but it's progressing through late-stage clinical trials -- and with a candidate that could enter one of the biggest growth markets in healthcare. I'm talking about the obesity drug market. Viking is developing VK2735 in injectable and oral formats. The injectable format is involved in a phase 3 trial right now, while the oral format is set to enter phase 3 in the third quarter of the year. Story Continues Both forms of VK2735 have delivered solid trial results so far and aim to enter the GLP-1 drug market in the not-too-distant future. This class of drugs works by stimulating hormonal pathways involved in digestion, and by doing so, GLP-1 drugs help regulate blood sugar levels and appetite. Today's commercialized GLP-1 drugs -- made by Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk -- have helped people worldwide easily shed pounds, and that's why they've become so popular. Viking also aims to launch a clinical trial for a new type of weight loss candidate this year -- one that interacts with amylin and calcitonin receptors, which play a key role in metabolism. Analysts predict an obesity drug market of almost $100 billion by the end of this decade, so there could be plenty of room for the market giants and certain newcomers to generate blockbuster revenue in this space. Viking stock may soar as much as 200% over the coming 12 months, according to the average Wall Street estimate. If such a gain happens -- even over a longer period of time -- early investors will score a major win. Should you buy stock in CRISPR Therapeutics right now?

      "content": "Civil War-Torn Sudan Sits On Unexplored Mineral Riches Worth Billions Alex Kimani Thu, February 19, 2026 at 5:00 PM MST 5 min read GC=F HG=F Long dominated by its agricultural and oil sectors, Sudan is now keen to unlock its vast mineral wealth as Africa's third-largest, and the world's thirteenth-largest, nation in terms of mineral diversity. Sudan is a major African gold producer, with the sector becoming a crucial source of foreign exchange following the loss of 75% of its oil revenue after the secession of South Sudan in 2011. However, ~75% of its resources remain unexplored, with deposits of copper, iron ore, chromite, zinc, base metals, uranium and various rare earth elements largely untouched. Now, in the throes of a civil war that erupted in April 2023, Sudan is courting investors to help develop the industry, hoping to take advantage of the Western world’s panic to secure non-Chinese rare earths supplies. In an interview with a visiting Turkish mining delegation in Khartoum, Ahmed Haroun Altom, director?general of Sudan’s General Authority for Geological Research, outlined the scale of the opportunity. Haroun highlighted state efforts to simplify licensing procedures and offer investment incentives, part of a broader strategy to boost foreign direct investment and diversify government revenue sources. He said the authority’s role encompasses geological surveying, evaluation and the dissemination of technical data to potential partners, efforts designed to reduce the risk premium for investors considering the country is still recovering from conflict and political instability. Related: Oil Demand Slumped by 614,000 Bpd in December on U.S. Decline The Turkish delegation with interests spanning mining, energy, petrochemicals, and electric vehicles, described Sudan’s untapped geology as a key lure, underscoring the opportunity for strategic partnerships in mineral extraction and downstream processing. Haorun says Sudan’s geological base is “rich and diverse”, particularly for gold, energy minerals, and industrial ores”, despite detailed exploration and valuation work remaining limited. Sudan's mineral sector has expanded sharply in recent years, with gold becoming one of the country’s most valuable exports. The country achieved record gold output of 64.4 tonnes in 2024, generating approximately $1.6 billion in government revenue despite the ongoing civil war. Last year, Sudan’s gold production set yet another record at 70 tonnes, generating about $1.8 billion, or nearly 4% of GDP. This production was largely driven by continued operations in 90% of mining areas and increased regulation. Story Continues Despite the sector’s size, Sudan’s industrial mining remains embryonic: according to research from Chatham House, much of the country’s output comes from artisanal and small?scale mining, which made up more than 80% of declared production. An estimated 1.5 million Sudanese people work in these small gold mines, operating outside formal government control. Both the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) control different, resource-rich regions, using smuggling routes to neighboring countries including Chad, Eritrea, and Egypt as well as the UAE. The RSF largely controls gold mines in Darfur and the west, while the SAF controls areas in the north and east. The Sudanese government aims to attract foreign investments into the country’s minerals sector using a variety of legislative and tax incentives including tax holidays, duty exemptions and profit repatriation, alongside developing infrastructure to improve access to mining sites. The National Investment Encouragement Act protects foreign investors from nationalization and provides mechanisms for international dispute resolution. Sudan is also focusing on modernizing its geological database through the Geological Research Authority of Sudan (GRAS) to provide accurate maps and information, critical for investor confidence. The Sudanese government is prioritizing the rehabilitation and development of infrastructure to bolster the mining sector, which has shown significant recovery in recent years. The Ministry of Minerals has approved a 2026 strategic plan aimed at increasing the production of strategic minerals by enhancing infrastructure, including road and rail networks to facilitate exports. The plan aims to strengthen monitoring and increasing production rates while also streamlining operations through Port Sudan to improve the export of minerals. Sudan's infrastructure, particularly roads and transport, requires substantial, sustained investment of nearly $4.2 billion per year over the next decade to improve connectivity and economic efficiency. Further, the government is focusing on integrating renewable energy, particularly solar power, to supply electricity to remote and off-grid mining sites. This aligns with broader national efforts to move away from heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels for power generation.The World Bank is actively supporting the energy transition in Sudan, including a $76.3 million project that features the installation of 500 renewable energy systems, aimed at boosting electricity access and supporting businesses. That said, Sudan continues to derive significant benefit from its neighbor's oil economy. Last year, the country lifted a nearly year-long force majeure on South Sudanese oil exports, allowing repairs on the Petrodar pipeline and the resumption of shipments. This move followed new security agreements with Juba to ensure the safety of the pipeline, which was previously halted due to war damage in Sudan. South Sudan pays significant oil revenues--sometimes in-kind--to Sudan, primarily as fees for transporting its crude through Sudanese pipelines to international markets. Sudan receives ~$9 per barrel from its neighbor to the south for transportation and processing fees depending on the pipeline, plus a Temporary Financial Arrangement (TFA) payment to compensate for Sudan's loss of oil fields. South Sudan exports more than 90% of its 90,000 bpd oil output via pipelines running through Sudan to Port Sudan.

Shares declined as higher crude oil prices pressured airline margins, with investors watching the company’s 10‑K filing and an upcoming safety-related vote. The company’s trading volume reached 63.5 million shares, which is nearly 15% above compared with its three-month average of 55.3 million shares. American Airlines Group went public in 2005 and has fallen 31% since its IPO. How the markets moved today S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) slipped 0.29% to finish Thursday’s session at 6,862, while the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) declined 0.31% to close at 22,683. Among airlines, industry peers Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) closed at $67.44 (-5.16%) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) finished at $110.05 (-5.88%), reflecting sector pressure from higher fuel costs. What this means for investors Crude oil hovering near six-month highs pressured airline stocks Thursday, driving a broad selloff across the sector. This pressure comes as American Airlines targets $1.70 to $2.70 in adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2026. The company posted record revenue last quarter but missed earnings expectations, leaving less room for error if fuel expenses keep rising. Since jet fuel is one of an airline’s highest operating costs, even modest increases in crude prices can quickly erode margins. The company’s 10-K filing and an upcoming safety-related vote added to the cautious tone, keeping regulatory and operational risks in view during a volatile session. Investors will closely watch whether American Airlines can protect margins and still deliver on its 2026 earnings target. Should you buy stock in American Airlines Group right now?

Every urban hotel aspires to being a cynosure of the city it’s in. Those that have succeeded can probably be counted on two hands. Having at least a century of operational history helps, as does an unassailable location. Above all such a hotel needs to be a repository of stories, both its own and the ones people create for themselves in it. Which brings us to the Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok, currently celebrating its 150th birthday. I lived for a while in south-east Asia, so I have my own little volume of memories made on its premises. I once checked my mother and father in after a sweaty adventure across Cambodia, and the hotel’s concierges sorted massages, private temple visits, longtail boat rides deep into the khlong canals and family-style Thai feasts at the river’s edge; it was one of the most joyful times we’ve ever spent together. Years later, when I was based in Bangkok itself, I decamped there when my relationship cratered in decidedly unjoyful circumstances and I needed to be anywhere but the flat I shared with my partner (the hotel’s GM, who was by then a friend, sent up alternating pots of chamomile and bottles of Billecart-Salmon). The Authors’ Wing of the Mandarin-Oriental Bangkok © Jack Hardy The Chao Phraya Suite © Jack Hardy The hotel’s Oriental Spa © Jack Hardy The hotel sent up alternating pots of chamomile and bottles of Billecart-Salmon The Oriental, as its many devotees call it, was founded in 1876, when Thailand was still Siam. By the late 1880s it was the hub of the city’s social scene. There are books dedicated to its roll call of luminary guests and historic happenings: a young merchant seaman by the name of Józef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski – later, Joseph Conrad – visited in 1888. The 1920s and 1930s brought Noël Coward and W Somerset Maugham, whose repeat stays sealed The Oriental’s enduring reputation as a writer’s refuge. The early 1940s saw it occupied by Japanese forces, who gutted the ornate interiors and filled the suites with prisoners of war. Postwar, it recovered with the help of expat American silk magnate (and high-ranking OSS agent) Jim Thompson, who quickly became a denizen of its new Bamboo Bar, which remains one of Asia’s most rollicking good-fun places to listen to live jazz. The Authors’ Wing in the 1880s Live music in The Bamboo Bar, 1949 And so it went, through the construction of two new wings, an enormous spa in its own teak pavilion, and an eventual merger with the Mandarin hotel group. The lobby most evenings is an assemblage of diners, drinkers and garden-variety gawkers come down from the hostels and guesthouses in the sois of Thonglor to snap photos in front of the towering floral arrangements. Regular guests know to get their lengths in early at the pool, tiled in orchid motifs and surrounded by burnt-orange towel-clad loungers, before the sunbathers infiltrate. The hotel has prepped a fresh face for its big birthday. Every room and suite has been remade; those in the Garden Wing are clad in pale hessian and Thai takes on De Gournay statement walls; the loft-like rooms in the River Wing have sleek velvet sectionals and tables set into bay picture windows, so when you look up from room service or your emails there’s the king of views laid out before you. The hotel lobby © Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok A Deluxe Premier room at the hotel © Jack Hardy The China House restaurant © Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok Female chefs are gratifyingly present: Anne-Sophie Pic has brought her two Michelin stars to Le Normandie, the French restaurant atop the Garden Wing, which she joined last September. But there’s also 35-year-old Phatchara “Pom” Pirapack, who oversees Baan Phraya, the hotel’s (excellent) new Thai fine-dining venue, wearing her signature Peaky Blinders cap. The terrace at Sala Rim Naam is still the place for more easy-going local food. Or get the club sandwich at The Verandah restaurant, any time of day; in the travelsphere it enjoys its own little cult of personality. The Mandarin Oriental Hotel Company – Hong Kong-based, with 45 hotels and residential projects in 28 countries – has a dynamic new CEO who’s ex-LVMH, and a huge pipeline in the offing: Mallorca is imminent, as are projects in Bali, Suzhou and Vietnam, and in a couple of years there will be an entire Egypt circuit complete with a Nile cruiser. It’s a growth strategy that’s now endemic to the big luxury brands. How can you express soul at such ambitious scale? Good thing MOHC brass has an edge to leverage: the stories, and the magic, of their first and forever best in class.

Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD ) on Tuesday rejected the latest hostile takeover bid from Paramount Skydance (NASDAQ: PSKY ), giving the David Ellison -led company until February 23 to submit its \"best and final offer.\" This offer can be matched by Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ) under the terms of the merger agreement, Warner Bros said in a statement. In the pre-market trading session on Tuesday, shares of Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount climbed 2.72%, each, while Netflix was trading 0.70% higher at last check. Don't Miss: Bad Ads Live Forever — See How This AI Helps Fortune 1000 Brands Avoid Them Disney Was Built on Character IP — This Pre-IPO Company Is Using the Same Playbook Paramount had informally proposed a higher share price of $31, which seemed to have piqued the interest of the Warner Bros board. However, Warner Bros Chairman Samuel DiPiazza Jr. and CEO David Zaslav clarified in a letter to the Paramount board that their proposal has not been deemed superior to the Netflix merger. They reiterated their commitment to the transaction with Netflix. Netflix-Paramount Merger Battle Intensifies This development follows a series of events in the ongoing merger saga. Earlier this month, activist investor Ancora took a stake in Warner Bros and opposed Netflix’s offer as Paramount sweetened its bid for the HBO owner. Paramount’s revised bid included a \"ticking fee\" payable to its shareholders for any potential delays in receiving regulatory approval for the deal, and a $2.8 billion termination fee payout to Netflix. Trending: Blue-chip art has historically outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, and fractional investing is now opening this institutional asset class to everyday investors. In December, Netflix agreed to buy Warner Bros. studios and HBO Max for $27.75 per share, following WBD's planned cable network spin-off. Paramount then launched a hostile all-cash bid for the entire company, including CNN and TNT, sparking a high-stakes battle. So far, Warner Bros. Discovery's board has remained committed to the Netflix deal, citing better value and regulatory clarity, despite Paramount's push to sway shareholders.

      "content": "Con Edison Earnings Climb as Infrastructure Spend Ramps Up Charles Kennedy Thu, February 19, 2026 at 9:00 PM CST 4 min read ED Consolidated Edison posted net income for common stock of $2.02 billion, or $5.66 per share, for 2025, up from $1.82 billion, or $5.26 per share, in 2024. On an adjusted basis, earnings rose to $5.70 per share from $5.40 a year earlier. The utility’s performance was underpinned by rate base growth at its core subsidiaries - Consolidated Edison Company of New York (CECONY) and Orange and Rockland Utilities (O&R) - as well as continued infrastructure investment tied to grid reliability and clean energy integration. More from Yahoo Scout Why did fourth-quarter results decline year-over-year? What drove Con Edison's 2025 earnings growth? How will Con Edison fund its $37 billion capital plan? What are Con Edison's 2026 earnings expectations? Fourth-quarter results were softer year over year. Net income for the quarter came in at $297 million, or $0.82 per share, compared with $310 million, or $0.90 per share, in the prior-year period. Adjusted fourth-quarter EPS declined to $0.89 from $0.98, reflecting higher operating and maintenance costs, increased corporate expenses, and dilution from share issuance. For 2026, Con Edison expects adjusted earnings per share in a range of $6.00 to $6.20. The company is targeting a five-year adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate of 6% to 7%, using the midpoint of its 2026 guidance as a baseline. That growth outlook is anchored by a substantial capital spending program. Con Edison plans to invest approximately $6.6 billion in 2026 and $6.8 billion in 2027. Between 2028 and 2030, the company expects to deploy an additional $24.3 billion, bringing total planned capital investment through 2030 to more than $37 billion. The spending will focus on electric transmission and distribution upgrades, gas system modernization, and projects that support electrification of buildings and transport—core pillars of New York State’s climate policy framework. To fund the buildout, Con Edison expects to rely on a mix of internally generated cash, long-term debt issuance, and equity offerings. The company plans to issue up to $3.2 billion in long-term debt in 2026 and up to $3.0 billion in 2027, including refinancing of maturing securities. Equity issuance is also expected, with up to $1.1 billion in common equity planned for 2026 and roughly $1.2 billion in 2027, alongside additional issuance through dividend reinvestment and employee plans. While the capital plan supports rate base expansion and earnings growth, it also implies continued balance sheet management and potential dilution—key variables for investors monitoring returns in a higher interest-rate environment. Operating revenues climbed to $16.9 billion in 2025 from $15.3 billion in 2024, driven primarily by higher electric and gas revenues. Operating income increased to $2.94 billion from $2.67 billion. Story Continues At CECONY, higher electric and gas rate bases and increased allowance for funds used during construction were significant contributors to year-over-year earnings growth. These gains were partially offset by higher interest expense and the dilutive impact of common share issuance. O&R benefited from a gas base rate increase, though higher borrowing costs weighed on results. The company also recorded charges tied to its investment in Honeoye Storage and transaction costs related to a strategic review of its interests in the Mountain Valley Pipeline and Honeoye. These items were excluded from adjusted results. Following the 2023 sale of its Clean Energy Businesses, Con Edison has sharpened its focus on regulated transmission and distribution. Recent regulatory approvals in New York—including investment plans that increased the authorized return on equity—provide improved earnings visibility and underpin the company’s multiyear growth trajectory. Con Edison also marked its 52nd consecutive annual dividend increase, reinforcing its appeal to income-focused investors. As electrification accelerates across the Northeast and grid resilience becomes a policy priority, Con Edison is positioning itself as a capital-intensive but steady-growth utility, leveraging predictable rate structures to deliver mid-single-digit earnings expansion through the end of the decade.

      "content": "Alliant Energy to Boost Capital Spending After 2025 Profit Growth Charles Kennedy Thu, February 19, 2026 at 7:50 PM CST 2 min read LNT Alliant Energy said 2025 GAAP EPS rose to $3.14 from $2.69 in 2024, while ongoing (non-GAAP) EPS increased to $3.22 from $3.04, representing 6% growth. The company affirmed 2026 ongoing EPS guidance of $3.36–$3.46. Management framed the year’s performance around execution on a growing regulated investment plan and “growing customer demand,” including an updated arrangement tied to QTS, a major data center operator, after renegotiating an electric service agreement based on a new project location. More from Yahoo Scout How much will Alliant invest in capital projects? What role do data centers play in growth? What drove Alliant Energy's 2025 earnings growth? Why is Alliant investing heavily in renewables? Alliant pointed to higher earnings primarily from increased revenue requirements tied to authorized rate base increases, reflecting ongoing investments in generation and energy storage. Temperature effects also supported results on a full-year basis, with the company estimating a $11 million net operating income tailwind from weather versus a $51 million headwind in 2024. Those gains were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance costs, including increased generation costs from planned maintenance and new resource additions, alongside higher development costs tied to longer-term growth. Depreciation and financing costs also rose as the capital program expanded. For 2025, ongoing EPS excludes $0.05/share tied to an asset valuation charge in the non-utility business and $0.03/share related to remeasurement of deferred tax assets driven by higher projected utility revenues from commercial and industrial customers, including data center agreements in its service areas. Alliant updated projected capital expenditures for 2026–2029, showing annual totals of: 2026: $3.13 billion 2027: $3.58 billion 2028: $3.63 billion 2029: $3.07 billion By category, the plan features sizeable allocations to renewables and energy storage (roughly $1.06–$1.50 billion per year over 2026–2029) and gas projects (peaking at $1.52 billion in 2027), alongside steady investment in electric and gas distribution systems. For regulated utilities, the core earnings engine remains rate base growth—deploying capital into projects that regulators allow utilities to earn a return on, then recovering costs through rates over time. Alliant’s emphasis on renewables/storage plus gas and grid spending tracks a broader U.S. utility trend: balancing reliability needs with decarbonization goals while preparing for incremental load growth, including from large commercial users such as data centers.

Q4 2025 Earnings Call Summary - Moby Strategic Pivot and Operational Drivers Transitioned from a consumer-centric model to a Payor fee-for-service model, achieving a 24% revenue CAGR since 2022 driven by a 56% increase in Payor sessions. Attributed growth to strategic initiatives that drive high-intent referrals from partners like Amazon and Zocdoc, alongside deeper directory integrations with insurance providers. Leveraged AI to optimize the member journey, resulting in a 49% increase in patients completing a third session within their first month of care. Expanded the Payor channel by investing in psychiatry services, military contracts, and Medicare enrollment to cater to higher acuity and underserved populations. Utilized a 'curated network' strategy to align clinician availability with specific utilization trends and geographic demand, ensuring efficient capacity management. Maintained strong brand awareness while significantly reducing marketing spend through search optimization and increased visibility in general-purpose large language models. Reported that 66% of teens in the NYC Teenspace program showed clinical improvement, validating the public-private partnership model for youth mental health. 2026 Outlook and Strategic Assumptions Projecting 2026 revenue between $275 million and $290 million, assuming the Payor business remains the primary growth engine with visibility from existing members. Anticipating adjusted EBITDA growth of 90% to 122%, with margins expected to exit the year in the mid-teens due to continued operating leverage. Planning the market launch of 'TalkAI' in late Q2 2026, a specialized, HIPAA-protected AI agent designed for clinical safety and human-in-the-loop escalation. Expects Direct-to-Enterprise (D2E) revenue to grow in the low single digits, accounting for typical Q1 renewal attrition and the roll-off of one-time implementation fees. Assumes a continued intentional decline in Consumer revenue as the company prioritizes higher-margin Enterprise and Payor channels. Strategic Acquisitions and Market Dynamics Acquired Wisdo, an AI-powered social health platform, to address loneliness in Medicare Advantage populations and enter pharma partnerships via group coaching. Noted that Payor reimbursement rates are seeing single-digit increases, a rare trend in healthcare driven by the high demand for scalable mental health solutions. Highlighted that Q4 2025 performance benefited from non-recurring implementation revenue associated with new enterprise account launches. Identified 'Generative Engine Optimization' (GEO) as a critical new marketing frontier to capture traffic from users searching for care via general-purpose AI tools. Story Continues Q&A Session Highlights Our analysts just identified a stock with the potential to be the next Nvidia. Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Commercialization and differentiation of the TalkAI agent Management plans to launch TalkAI as a direct-to-consumer product first to test pricing and engagement before expanding to enterprise clients. The agent is positioned as a safer, clinically-supervised alternative to general LLMs, specifically trained to identify 10 areas of clinical risk in real-time. Early beta testing with approximately 1,000 users shows high engagement, with users often more willing to share sensitive information with an AI than a human. Impact of Directory Integrations on member acquisition costs Talkspace is expanding from one major directory integration in 2025 to at least three in early 2026, which lowers friction by allowing booking directly within payor portals. These integrations act as a 'narrowing of the network' by payors, effectively giving Talkspace an outsized share of traffic from insurance portals. Management noted they often have a 'seat at the table' in designing these search algorithms because many payors are implementing such integrations for the first time. Sustainability of Medicare and Medicare Advantage growth The company is participating in the CMS Innovation Center's access programs, which are outcome-based models that align with Talkspace's data-tracking capabilities. The Wisdo acquisition is specifically helping penetrate the Medicare Advantage market by addressing social isolation, a key metric for those plans. Management remains confident in Medicare growth despite broader healthcare cost pressures, as outpatient mental health is a small but cost-saving portion of total spend. One stock.

Q4 2025 Earnings Call Summary - Moby Strategic Performance Drivers Record 2025 performance was driven by an 11% increase in Permian volumes and record NGL transport, fractionation, and LPG export throughput. Management attributes growth to a combination of existing customer drilling activity and significant commercial success, adding several billion cubic feet per day of gas volumes beyond legacy dedications. The company is executing an aggressive 8-plant expansion plan over two years to provide 2.2 billion cubic feet per day of incremental processing capacity to meet rising demand. Strategic positioning in the Delaware Basin is intensifying due to a more diverse customer set and upward revisions in producer activity forecasts. The 'wellhead-to-water' strategy integrates G&P with downstream assets, allowing Targa to capture margins across the entire value chain while ensuring flow assurance for producers. Operational resilience was demonstrated during January winter storms, where assets remained online and ready to receive volumes immediately as temperatures improved. Outlook and Capital Strategy Management expects 2026 Permian volume growth to remain in the low double digits, consistent with previous long-term guidance. Post-2027 capital spending is projected to stabilize at approximately $2.5 billion annually, assuming a pace of roughly three new plants per year. The completion of the Speedway pipeline and LPG export expansion in late 2027 is expected to drive run-rate adjusted EBITDA over $6 billion and significantly increase free cash flow. Guidance for 2026 adjusted EBITDA of $5.4 billion to $5.6 billion assumes conservative marketing gains and relies on high fee-based margin stability. Future growth capital assumes minimal NGL transport and LPG export spending for several years following the current major project cycle. Strategic Developments and Risks Targa announced the new Yeti II processing plant and Fractionator 13 to support NGL supply growth through 2028 and beyond. The acquisition of Stakeholder and other bolt-on transactions added approximately 500,000 dedicated acres and 2 million acres in areas of mutual interest. Waha natural gas prices are expected to remain volatile through 2026 until new egress pipelines like Blackcomb and Traverse come online. Management noted that lead times for critical infrastructure like compression and power generation are lengthening, requiring earlier capital commitments. Q&A Session Highlights Drivers of Permian volume resiliency versus industry peers Our analysts just identified a stock with the potential to be the next Nvidia. Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Story Continues Growth is fueled by a large footprint across both Delaware and Midland basins and strong producer relationships that led to significant commercial wins in 2024 and 2025. Management expressed increased optimism for 2027 and beyond based on bottoms-up producer forecasts and continued step-out project opportunities. Impact of rising Gas-to-Oil Ratios (GOR) on production Gas production is expected to grow at a rate approximately 4% higher than crude oil growth due to increasing GORs and targeting of gassier zones. Targa expects to continue outperforming general basin growth rates due to its specific acreage dedications and infrastructure positioning. Marketing optimization and Waha basis exposure The company captured $150 million in higher-than-expected optimization in 2025, primarily from utilizing transport positions during price dislocations. While 2026 guidance is conservative regarding marketing gains, Targa maintains significant transport capacity to ensure flow and capture spreads if volatility persists. Capital expenditure bridge and long-lead item strategy The $4.5 billion 2026 CapEx budget includes spending for Yeti II, Frac 13, and long-lead items for two additional 2028 plants. Increased spending also reflects higher field gathering and compression costs necessary to support recent commercial successes and acquisitions. One stock.

      "content": "Meta Just Made a Striking Move. And It's Excellent News for Nvidia. Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool Thu, February 19, 2026 at 8:30 PM CST 5 min read NVDA META AMD ^GSPC AMZN Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has been one of the most noteworthy names in the artificial intelligence (AI) space over the past couple of years. The company, known for its social media apps, has spoken of its intentions to pursue AI and even bring superintelligence to people around the world. As part of this, Meta has been spending billions of dollars to build out data centers, create large language models, and offer AI features to app users and its advertising customers. What's the relationship between Meta and AI chip leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) ? Meta is one of Nvidia's biggest customers, buying the tech giant's graphics processing units (GPUs) to power key tasks such as the training of its AI models. Though Meta is a significant Nvidia customer, the company has also turned to rival chip designer Advanced Micro Devices in the past, and Meta even makes its own chips. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks » Meta isn't alone. Some of Nvidia's other customers -- Amazon , for example -- operate in the same way: They seek chips from a variety of sources. And this has prompted investors to worry that Nvidia eventually may lose market share. But, in recent days, Meta made a striking move, and it's excellent news for Nvidia. Let's check it out. Image source: Getty Images. An early focus on GPUs First, though, let's start off with a quick summary of Nvidia's business so far. Even before AI became a high-growth industry, Nvidia recognized the potential of the technology and decided to design its GPUs to suit it. This early market presence helped Nvidia build an AI empire that now includes a variety of products from software to networking tools. Importantly, this focus on AI from the earliest days has brought Nvidia expertise and kept the company a step ahead of rivals: Nvidia's GPUs continue to maintain their reputation as the most powerful on the market. On top of this, Nvidia has committed to updating these chips annually, a move that makes it very difficult for competitors to slip ahead. Still, investors have worried about the increasing strength of products from rivals such as AMD -- and even moves by Meta, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and others to create their own chips. These new chips are cheaper than Nvidia's GPUs, offering them a clear selling point. Now, let's turn to the move Meta just made that should relieve investors' concerns. Meta has signed a new deal with Nvidia for the purchase of millions of chips, including GPUs, stand-alone central processing units (CPUs), and networking and security technologies. The value of the deal wasn't released, but CNBC cited Creative Strategies analyst Ben Bajarin as saying it may be worth \"tens of billions of dollars.\" Story Continues Nvidia's CPUs for data centers A key point here is that Meta is turning to Nvidia for CPUs, the main processor in a computer, and will use these chips on their own in data centers -- this represents the first big move by Nvidia, a GPU specialist, in the CPU for data centers market. And the really good news here is that this deal shows the strength of Nvidia's leadership. Though Meta has developed its own chips and could also turn to other players for chips, the company instead has chosen Nvidia as the backbone of its AI infrastructure. Meta has put an enormous focus on AI , so it's clear this company is looking for the very best products to shepherd it along the path -- and once again, it's chosen Nvidia. So, what does this mean for investors? This doesn't suggest that other AI chip companies won't be successful. There is plenty of room for more than one company to generate significant revenue in this space. But this deal makes it clear that Meta's development of its own chips and even potential moves to buy chips from other companies aren't meant to replace Nvidia. And it's very likely that other Nvidia customers are taking the same route, diversifying supply while still relying on the AI giant. All of this should relieve worries about Nvidia losing market share -- and spur optimism about Nvidia's next chip launch later this year. Should you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

Management attributes U.S. glaucoma growth to the successful advancement of the interventional treatment paradigm, shifting the standard of care toward earlier surgical intervention. International glaucoma net sales grew 13% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter, reflecting broad-based scaling of infrastructure despite emerging competitive trialing headwinds in major markets. The FDA approval of Epioxa is viewed as a 'complete reset' for the corneal health franchise, transitioning from the legacy Photrexa to a non-invasive, epithelium-on therapy. Strategic positioning has evolved from a MIGS-focused company to a diversified leader across glaucoma, rare corneal diseases, and retinal health. Operational execution focused on expanding the 'site of care' network, which now covers nearly 50% of the U.S. population for the upcoming Epioxa launch. 2026 Outlook and Strategic Assumptions Full-year 2026 revenue guidance of $600 million to $620 million assumes over 20% growth, led by a 30% increase in U.S. glaucoma sales entirely attributed to iDose TR. The Epioxa launch strategy anticipates a 'warehousing effect' in Q2 and Q3 as patients navigate prior authorization hurdles before a permanent J-code becomes effective in July 2026. Management expects continued sequential quarterly growth for iDose TR throughout 2026, even in seasonally lower procedure periods like Q1. Financial strategy targets reaching cash flow breakeven during 2026 by balancing aggressive commercial investments with disciplined capital allocation. International guidance assumes high single-digit growth, factoring in competitive headwinds and the expiration of favorable currency tailwinds in the second half of the year. Operational Risks and Structural Changes The transition from Photrexa to Epioxa is expected to cause significant revenue volatility in mid-2026 due to the phase-out of the legacy product and initial payer adoption lags. Medicare Advantage mix shifts in Q4 2025 created slight sequential deceleration in iDose growth due to different patient out-of-pocket dynamics compared to fee-for-service. The company is aggressively investing in a 'best-in-class' patient hub and specialty pharmacy infrastructure to mitigate the high denial rates typical of rare disease drug launches. Ongoing clinical risks include the transition of iDose TREX into Phase IIb/III trials and the upcoming Phase III program for third-generation iLink therapy. Story Continues Q&A Session Summary Payer feedback and pricing pushback on Epioxa launch Our analysts just identified a stock with the potential to be the next Nvidia. Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Management reported no formal or informal pushback on Epioxa pricing from the top commercial payers engaged thus far. Early positive coverage determinations have already been secured from several Medicaid societies and a large Blue Cross Blue Shield plan prior to drug availability. Impact of iDose TR unlimited re-administration labeling The new label allows for repeat treatments in patients with healthy corneas, which management believes creates a 'halo effect' for initial starts by ensuring long-term disease management options. While re-administration is not a material driver for 2026 guidance, it is expected to be a significant contributor to the revenue mix starting in 2027 and 2028. Operating expense trajectory and path to profitability Operating expenses are projected to grow in the mid-teens to approximately $555 million to $560 million in 2026. Management emphasized that this spend level still provides operating leverage while funding the dual launches of iDose and Epioxa. Status of MAC reimbursement and professional fees for iDose The company expects to establish coverage with Palmetto in the coming days or weeks, adding to progress already made with other Medicare Administrative Contractors such as WPS and CGS. The company is focusing 2026 efforts on optimizing the 'process' for commercial and Medicare Advantage claims to reduce administrative barriers for surgeons. One stock.

The decline in new pool starts to approximately 60,000 units represents a 40% drop from 2022 levels, reflecting broader macroeconomic pressures on discretionary construction activity. Gross margin expansion to 29.7% was driven by disciplined pricing strategies, supply chain efficiencies, and the growth of higher-margin exclusive brands. Operational focus shifted from rapid facility expansion to 'capacity absorption,' prioritizing value extraction from the existing network of 456 sales centers. Digital transformation reached a record 15% of annual sales, with the POOL360 platform's AI features enhancing customer engagement and operational agility. Regional performance was impacted by tough year-over-year comparisons in Florida due to prior-year hurricane recovery, while Texas showed early signs of recovery late in the year. Management highlighted a 'pent-up demand' thesis, suggesting that deferred upgrades and projects will return to the market once consumer confidence stabilizes. 2026 Outlook and Strategic Priorities The 2026 guidance assumes new pool construction remains flat at approximately 60,000 units, with growth driven by maintenance and market share gains. Net sales are projected to grow in the low single-digit range, supported by a 1% to 2% pricing benefit from vendor cost pass-throughs. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $10.85 and $11.15, assuming no significant recovery in discretionary spending trends. Operating margin improvement is anticipated through network optimization, though gains will be partially offset by a $10 million to $15 million increase in incentive compensation. Capital allocation will prioritize reinvesting 1% to 1.5% of net sales into the business and allocating $25 million to $50 million for opportunistic acquisitions. Operational Risks and Structural Factors Inventory levels increased 13% to $1.45 billion as a proactive strategy to secure products ahead of estimated 2026 cost increases. Self-insured medical costs are rising significantly above general inflation rates, creating a persistent headwind for operating expenses. The 2026 tax rate is estimated at 25%, with management noting no projected benefit from ASU tax items in the upcoming year. A 'focus list' strategy is being applied to underperforming branches to drive profitability through better customer engagement and cost-to-serve efficiencies. Story Continues Q&A Session Highlights Incentive compensation sensitivity to flat revenue scenarios Our analysts just identified a stock with the potential to be the next Nvidia. Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Management clarified that the incentive compensation reset is a sliding scale; if revenue remains flat, the $10 million to $15 million expense increase would not trigger. If the market lags further, the company would implement additional cost-saving measures to align SG&A with actual market demand. Gross margin sustainability and product mix levers Management expects first-quarter margins to benefit from early-buy inventory investments before normalizing mid-season. Tailwinds include the continued shift toward proprietary brands and the potential for renovation/remodel projects to outpace new construction. Regional recovery trends in Texas and Florida Texas is showing signs of firming up, particularly in Dallas and Austin, while Houston continues to lag slightly. Florida remains a cornerstone market with positive 2-year growth stacks despite the volatility of storm-related comparisons. Demand creation through technological modernization of pool equipment Management sees a significant opportunity to expand the Total Addressable Market (TAM) by encouraging the replacement of legacy equipment with high-tech, automated systems. The company is launching 'Prozone' in showrooms to actively educate builders and servicers on the benefits of modernizing the 'pool pad' for homeowners. One stock.

The company is successfully moving upmarket, with customers contributing over $50,000 in ARR now representing 61% of total ARR, up from 57% a year ago. Strategic positioning focuses on a three-pillar platform—Unified Endpoint Management (UEM), Security Operations, and Data Protection—to drive solution consolidation and reduce vendor sprawl for customers. Operational efficiency was bolstered by opening a new R&D center in India to deepen engineering capacity while maintaining a 30% adjusted EBITDA margin. The VAR (Value-Added Reseller) channel expansion is providing a new outbound motion, particularly for UEM solutions in enterprise environments struggling with tool complexity. 2026 Outlook and Strategic Priorities The 2026 plan assumes steady demand and stable retention, with the high end of guidance calling for 20% more net new ARR dollars on a constant currency basis than in 2025. Management expects a second-half weighted performance in 2026 as new product initiatives, currently in customer preview, reach general availability. Strategic focus will shift toward 'N-zo,' an AI workflow assistant designed to close the IT skills gap by automating complex scripting and diagnostic tasks. TAM expansion initiatives include the mid-2026 launch of Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS) and Google Workspace coverage to address rising business continuity expectations. Guidance methodology assumes FX rates of 1.17 for the euro and 1.34 for the pound, with a focus on improving unlevered free cash flow through India-based development synergies. Risk Factors and Structural Dynamics The democratization of coding via AI is identified as a risk factor that increases the speed and sophistication of cyberattacks, necessitating deeper domain expertise from providers. Non-GAAP earnings per share in Q4 2025 experienced a $0.02 negative impact due to one-time fees related to a new $400 million debt facility. Gross margins decreased from 84% in 2024 to 81% in 2025. Management highlighted that 75% of new security operations lands are greenfield, indicating a significant portion of the market still operates without professional security operations tools.

Confidence in accelerating constant currency ARR growth for 2026 Growth is underwritten by steady to slightly improved gross retention and a list of new SKUs gaining traction, such as AI-powered XDR. The strategy relies on a multipronged approach: improved retention, better expansion on new SKUs, and accelerated reach within the VAR community. Monetization strategy for AI-driven product innovations Management outlined a three-pronged AI strategy: infusing AI into existing products to improve retention, launching in-product AI agents like N-zo, and creating standalone AI-specific SKUs. AI is viewed as a labor unlock for MSPs, allowing them to scale and service more customers without proportional headcount increases. Adlumin cross-sell performance and greenfield market opportunity Success is driven by the solution's ability to ingest logs from any firewall or EDR, making it vendor-agnostic and highly attractive for complex environments. Approximately 70% to 75% of opportunities are greenfield, suggesting the market for security operations is still in early-stage adoption for many MSPs. One stock.

Q4 2025 Earnings Call Summary - Moby Strategic Transformation and Performance Drivers Management characterized 2025 as a foundational year focused on leadership mobilization and strategic clarity, transitioning to a 'year of execution' in 2026. Revenue declines in IT Staffing (7%) and Data and Analytics (24%) were attributed to a deliberate shift toward higher-value work and a challenging year-over-year comparison from 2024 backlog reversals. The company achieved record-high average bill rates of $87.32 by exercising pricing discipline and consciously exiting non-strategic, low-margin staffing positions. Operational stability was maintained through the EDGE (Efficiencies Driving Growth and Expansion) initiative, which optimized the cost structure to free up capacity for future investments. Strategic positioning is shifting toward an 'AI-first' model, deepening partnerships with GCP, Snowflake, and Informatica to bridge the 'pilot to scale' gap for enterprise clients. Performance in the IT Staffing segment was specifically impacted by a top-10 customer's decision to in-source roles, a trend management expects to persist through the first half of 2026. 2026 Outlook and Strategic Priorities The 2026 strategy focuses on three pillars: delivering sustainable growth, unlocking customer value through AI, and investing in differentiated capabilities. Management plans to disproportionately invest in go-to-market strategies, leadership, and AI-powered industry solutions starting in Q1 2026. Targeted growth will focus on Global 2000 customers within the Health Sciences, Financial Services, and Retail sectors due to their high potential for AI-driven disruption. The company noted a volatile macro environment where policy shifts typically take one to two quarters to impact enterprise IT spending behaviors. The company intends to leverage its strong cash position of $36.5 million for organic capability building and potential opportunistic M&A. Structural Changes and Risk Factors The company incurred $5 million in severance and finance/accounting transition costs during 2025, though these transitions are now considered complete. A new $5 million share repurchase program was authorized, effective February 16, 2026, following the expiration of the previous program. Headcount in IT Staffing fell 16.7% year-over-year, reflecting both the in-sourcing headwind and a strategic pivot away from high-volume, low-margin business. Management flagged limited near-term visibility due to macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, though underlying demand for modernization remains steady. Story Continues Q&A Session Highlights Our analysts just identified a stock with the potential to be the next Nvidia. Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Sustainability of cost savings and future investment levels Management confirmed that the finance and accounting transition is complete, with no further material severance or transition costs expected. Savings from the EDGE program are being actively reinvested into senior leadership for AI analytics and new logo acquisition in the banking sector. Revenue growth expectations versus market headwinds Nirav Patel emphasized that growth is the 'paramount' goal for 2026, despite a volatile macro backdrop. Early Q1 discussions show 'reasonable confidence' from clients, with no radical shifts in spending behavior observed yet. Drivers behind the 37% increase in Q4 bookings The surge in bookings was largely driven by strong renewals, which management views as a validation of their relevance to existing clients. These renewals provide a stable platform to upsell new AI-first services and 'reimagining' workflows to the current customer base. One stock.

IonQ , Rigetti Computing , and D-Wave Quantum delivered the kind of returns that make investors who missed out feel queasy. But for all the hype, there's something quantum bulls don't love to admit: The \"smart money\" isn't convinced. Wall Street's exposure to the pure-play quantum computing stocks that dominate Reddit threads and YouTube thumbnails is limited. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks » Most institutional buying in quantum pure plays isn't what it looks like Yes, institutional investment in the sector rose dramatically last year, but most of that capital flowed in from passive exchange-traded fund (ETF) and index fund managers, not active hedge funds. When you see that BlackRock \"owns\" 30 million shares of IonQ, it's easy to misunderstand this as implying BlackRock likes the stock. It doesn't. Instead, it reflects mechanical buying driven by IonQ's inclusion in an index like the Russell 2000 . This passive buying is responsible for the vast majority of Wall Street activity in quantum pure plays, but even the active side of things is misleading. Most of these are hedge funds that trade on momentum, looking to take advantage of short-term trends. They're not buying with conviction and holding for the long term. It's easy to see why. Image source: Getty Images. The numbers don't lie Rigetti posted $1.95 million in revenue last quarter. IonQ is growing faster, but still reported an adjusted loss of nearly $49 million in its most recent quarter. Both companies have had to raise massive amounts of capital -- IonQ through a $2 billion equity offering, Rigetti through a $350 million raise -- just to extend their runways. Every dollar comes with shareholder dilution attached. These are companies hoping quantum computing can reach commercial viability in a few years' time. There is a very good chance that this technology could take much longer to mature -- decades, even. In fact, there's still a question of whether real, viable quantum computing will ever be possible outside of a lab. Wall Street's real quantum bet is hiding in plain sight So where is Wall Street actually putting its money? It may not be as exciting as the pure plays, but the answer is hiding in plain sight: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) -- parent company of Google. And just to be clear, Wall Street isn't buying it because of quantum computing, but they love that quantum is one more reason among many to believe that Alphabet is a long-term wealth builder. Story Continues When you buy IonQ, you're betting everything on quantum working, and within a reasonably short time frame. When you buy Alphabet, you're getting a dominant, diversified business that also happens to be a leader in the quantum race. Alphabet can afford to wait -- its competitors can't The quantum industry has a habit of overpromising on timelines, and investors should be appropriately skeptical. Real-world quantum computing applications, the kind that generate the sort of revenue that would justify the sky-high market capitalizations of Rigetti and its peers, could be a decade or more away. And Alphabet doesn't need quantum to work anytime soon -- that's the key difference. The company generated more than $73 billion in free cash flow last year. Its R&D budget alone is bigger than the combined market capitalizations of all the pure plays combined. IonQ, Rigetti, and D-Wave all have to worry about their very survival if the technology is further off than they claim. Alphabet can patiently wait, however long it takes. Wall Street loves Alphabet because it is a cash machine that dominates the current tech landscape and has shown a remarkable ability to innovate over the years, often at the forefront of technological change. The worst-case scenario is that you own one of the most profitable businesses in history. The best case is that you also own the company that defines quantum computing's commercial future, whenever it arrives. Should you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

Management attributed commercial success to a fundamental shift in customer behavior from single-project focus to a 'portfolio approach,' where operators develop multiple greenfield assets in parallel to achieve industrialization. The transition away from legacy projects is nearly complete, with legacy work now representing less than 10% of the Subsea backlog, significantly derisking project execution and margin profiles. Operational momentum is supported by a record-high Subsea Opportunity list of approximately $29 billion, reflecting six consecutive quarters of value growth despite high award activity. Strategic positioning as both 'architect and builder' allows the company to engage with clients earlier in the cycle, shifting the conversation from pricing to the reduction of cycle time and improved project returns. Surface Technologies' margin expansion was driven by a strategic pivot toward high-grading the portfolio, focusing on international markets like Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi while reducing exposure to volatile North American activity. Outlook and Strategic Initiatives The 2026 outlook assumes continued Subsea inbound strength of approximately $10 billion, with expectations for further order growth in 2027 and beyond as the opportunity list accelerates. Management expects to deliver $2.1 billion in total company adjusted EBITDA at the midpoint for 2026, representing 15% growth over 2025 when excluding foreign exchange impacts. Strategic focus is expanding from the seabed to the 'water column' (SURF), aiming to apply configure-to-order efficiencies to the entire subsea environment to drive further margin upside. Guidance for 2026 includes a commitment to return at least 70% of free cash flow to shareholders, supported by a disciplined asset-light model with capital expenditures capped at approximately 3% of revenue. Restructuring actions initiated in late 2025 are expected to deliver sustainable operating efficiency improvements starting in 2026 and increasing in subsequent years. Operational Context and Risk Factors The company recorded $52 million in restructuring and impairment charges in Q4 2025, specifically tied to simplification and industrialization actions aimed at 2026 efficiency gains. Subsea margins in Q4 were impacted by seasonally lower vessel-based activity and higher scheduled fleet maintenance, which reduced overall availability. Management highlighted that while the North American Surface Technologies market remains difficult, the segment's 65% international revenue mix provides a structural hedge against domestic volatility. The shift toward gas-directed subsea projects is noted as a complexity driver, as gas equipment typically requires higher unit costs and more differentiated technology due to corrosive environments. Story Continues Q&A Session Insights Margin expansion potential from industrializing the SURF process Our analysts just identified a stock with the potential to be the next Nvidia. Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Management is expanding configure-to-order applications from the seabed to the water column (SURF), expecting efficiency gains similar to those seen with Subsea 2.0. The focus is on reducing cycle time and improving project certainty, which allows the company to share in the greater economic value created for the client. Sustainability of Subsea inbound levels beyond $10 billion The $10 billion figure is not a 'magic number'; management expects the growing and accelerating Subsea Opportunity list to drive further inbound growth in 2027 and beyond. The client base has expanded 3x to 4x historically, as the iEPCI 2.0 model enables smaller companies to pursue subsea developments previously reserved for majors. Impact of the 'portfolio approach' on project content and visibility Executing projects like bp's Tiber and Kaskida simultaneously allows for a single project team and a continuous supply chain, avoiding the 'on-off' inefficiencies of historical methods. Being the 'architect' allows TechnipFMC to incorporate its own technologies into the field design from the outset, potentially increasing content per project. Free cash flow conversion and working capital tailwinds While 2026 will see improved working capital, management cautioned against assuming perpetual improvements, suggesting a 'neutral' working capital assumption for long-term modeling. The business remains low capital intensity, which supports strong through-cycle free cash flow power regardless of short-term working capital swings. One stock.

Q4 2025 Earnings Call Summary - Moby Strategic Performance Drivers and Operational Context Fourth quarter room night growth of 9% exceeded expectations, fueled by resilient travel demand and strategic investments in the U.S. and Asia markets. Management attributed significant margin expansion to the Transformation Program, which achieved a $550 million annual run rate savings target by the end of 2025. The Connected Trip strategy continues to gain traction, with multi-vertical transactions growing in the high 20% range as flights serve as a critical customer acquisition funnel. The Genius loyalty program remains a primary growth engine, with high-tier members now accounting for over 50% of room nights and demonstrating higher direct booking rates. Management emphasized their unique supplier value proposition, noting that nearly 90% of bookings come from independent partners who rely on Booking's global scale and fintech capabilities. Generative AI is being integrated across the traveler journey to enhance personalization and search, while simultaneously driving down customer service costs per booking. 2026 Outlook and Strategic Reinvestment Framework The company is targeting 2026 constant currency top-line growth approximately 100 basis points ahead of its long-term 8% algorithm, supported by aggressive reinvestment. Management plans to reinvest $700 million into strategic priorities, including GenAI, fintech, and international expansion for OpenTable, expecting $400 million in incremental 2026 revenue. Guidance for 2026 assumes travel industry growth remains consistent with recent years, with a target of 50 basis points in adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. The Transformation Program is expected to deliver $500 million to $550 million in in-year savings for 2026, effectively self-funding the majority of new growth initiatives. A 25-for-1 stock split was announced to take effect in April 2026, alongside a 9.4% increase in the quarterly cash dividend. Structural Changes and Risk Factors A $44 million accrual for an indirect tax matter impacted fourth quarter fixed operating expenses. The merchant mix increased to 70% of total gross bookings, driving higher payment revenues but also resulting in increased payment processing expenses. Management noted slightly lower ADRs and shorter lengths of stay in the U.S., suggesting some consumer segments are becoming more thoughtful regarding discretionary spending. FX volatility remains a factor, with a projected positive impact of 2.5 percentage points on 2026 reported gross bookings growth based on current rates. Q&A Session Highlights Marketing spend deleverage and tactical investment strategy Our analysts just identified a stock with the potential to be the next Nvidia. Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Story Continues Management explained that Q4 marketing deleverage was a tactical choice to 'strike while the iron is hot' in social media and performance channels. They emphasized that these investments are enabled by structural savings elsewhere in the P&L, allowing for aggressive customer acquisition without sacrificing overall margin targets. Economic uplift and product cadence for agentic AI Early data from agentic tools shows increased engagement, faster search, and lower cancellation rates, though the absolute numbers remain small. Management declined to provide a specific rollout playbook but highlighted that AI is already delivering tangible P&L benefits through a 10% reduction in customer service costs per booking. Competitive dynamics with Large Language Models (LLMs) Glenn Fogel argued that OTAs are protected by the extreme complexity of being a 'merchant of record,' involving 100+ payment methods and dense global regulations. He suggested LLMs are more likely to remain at the top of the funnel as advertising partners rather than building the deep supplier integrations and customer service infrastructure required for travel execution. Growth trajectory for alternative accommodations While growth has moderated, management remains optimistic, noting an 8% increase in listings to 8.6 million globally. The U.S. market was highlighted as a specific area where alternative accommodation supply is growing faster than the global average. One stock.

Kraft Heinz Co logo on building by- JHVEPhoto via iStock Larry Ramer Thu, February 19, 2026 at 6:30 PM CST 4 min read KHC BRK.A After Kraft Heinz (KHC) announced that it would postpone its breakup into two entities and spend $600 million to improve itself, I believe that the moves could potentially help the company in the longer term. Still, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B), which owned 27.5% of KHC as of January, may still decide to unload its entire stake in the packaged-foods giant, putting a great deal of downward pressure on its shares. Moreover, Kraft Heinz reported discouraging fourth-quarter results, and multiple macro trends are weighing on the name. For all of these reasons, I would not recommend buying KHC stock at this point, despite its high dividend and low valuation.

Sign Up Now! About Kraft Heinz Kraft Heinz, as its name indicates, owns and markets the Kraft and Heinz brands. Based in Chicago and Pittsburgh, it also owns many other consumer packaged food brands, such as Oscar Mayer, Jell-O, and Philadelphia Cream Cheese. The company has a market capitalization of $29.36 billion. Last September, the firm announced that it would split itself into two companies, with one entity focusing primarily on “sauces, spreads and seasonings.” The other spun-off firm was going to include the Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles, and Lunchables brands. But in January, Kraft Heinz's new CEO, Steve Cahillane, stated that KHC would postpone the split to focus on “returning the business to profitable growth.” The CEO indicated that the company would stay united for all of 2026. In Q4, the food giant's sales dropped 3.4% versus the same period a year earlier to $6.35 billion, while its operating income, excluding certain items, tumbled 15.9% year-over-year (YoY) to $1.16 billion. Also falling was its adjusted gross profit margin, which dropped 1.3 percentage points to 33.1%. The shares have a forward price-earnings ratio of 11.9 times, and analysts on average expect its earnings per share to fall 21.5% in 2026 to $2.04, versus the EPS of $2.60 that it generated in 2025. www.barchart.com New Investments Can Potentially Help the Company As I reported in my last column on KHC, the many consumers who are concerned about their health have been purchasing fewer of the company's products, a high proportion of which are not very healthy. Therefore, I believe that Kraft Heinz can use a portion of the funds that it intends to invest in its U.S. business to develop new, healthier products and market them to U.S. consumers. The firm could also launch new products, enter new markets, and potentially make sizeable acquisitions in emerging markets, where its sales rose an impressive 4.6% last quarter, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestments. Story Continues In 12 to 18 months, these investments could begin helping the company. But on the other hand, they may not move the needle for KHC stock during that time frame. Other Adverse Macro Trends and Berkshire's Potential Stock Sale Potentially exacerbating Kraft Heinz's problems with health-conscious consumers, the GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, by giving individuals greater control of their eating habits, are meaningfully lowering consumption of snacks. Further, the company noted in its Q4 earnings release that it had faced “inflationary pressures in commodity and manufacturing costs that outpaced (its) efficiency initiatives.” With inflation in the U.S. still running fairly high, the latter trends are likely to continue to weigh on the firm's profitability. Finally, amid high inflation, many cost-conscious consumers have been buying cheaper store brands instead of Kraft's offerings, and that trend could continue or even intensify. Meanwhile, Warren Buffett, Berkshire's former CEO and current chairman, said last year (when he was still CEO) that the merger between Kraft and Heinz “certainly didn’t turn out to be a brilliant idea” and did not state that Berkshire would avoid selling its KHC stock. Moreover, Berkshire last month in an SEC filing disclosed that it could sell up to 99.9% of its stake in KHC. Although Berkshire's current CEO, Greg Abel, effusively praised Kraft Heinz's decision to postpone its separation, he also did not appear to have committed to Berkshire retaining its stake in the food conglomerate. Therefore, Berkshire could very well decide to sell most of or a significant portion of its KHC stock. The Bottom Line on KHC Kraft Heinz has a relatively low valuation and a high dividend yield of 6.6%. But the company could drastically lower its dividend down the road, and it's still facing multiple adverse macro trends, while it reported weak Q4 results, and Berkshire may unload most of its stake in the company. Further, given the company's challenges, there's a good chance that its turnaround efforts may not boost its stock. As a result of all of these factors, investors should avoid holding KHC stock at this point.

(NASDAQ: AKBA ) is one of the best growth stocks to buy for the next 20 years . On February 6, Piper Sandler analyst Allison Bratzel lowered the firm’s price target on Akebia to $4 from $6 and kept an Overweight rating. This adjustment was made as part of a broader review of commercial-stage companies, with the firm updating estimates and price targets following several year-end preliminary reports and ahead of official Q4 2025 results. In Q3, Akebia Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:AKBA) reported total revenue of $58.8 million with a net income of $540,000, successfully pivoting from a $20 million net loss in Q3 2024. While the launch of its dialysis drug Vafseo saw lower-than-expected revenue of $14.3 million due to operational and adherence hurdles, the company expanded its patient access to 70,000 and reached a milestone of over 700 active prescribers. Despite an anticipated temporary revenue dip in Q4 due to inventory adjustments at US Renal Care, management projects growth to resume in Q1 2026. The company remains focused on its 2026 pipeline outlook, including the initiation of a Phase 2 rare kidney disease study, while maintaining that its current cash reserves are sufficient to fund its path toward sustained profitability.

(NYSE: RAMP ) is one of the best growth stocks to buy for the next 20 years . On February 6, DA Davidson lowered its price target on LiveRamp to $35 from $45 with a Buy rating. Although the company exceeded top and bottom-line expectations in FQ3 2026, management left its fiscal year 2026 guidance unchanged. The analyst attributed this cautious outlook to the timing of specific project-based expenses shifting into FQ4 and marketplace growth that came in softer than previously anticipated. In its FQ3 earnings report posted a day prior, LiveRamp Holdings Inc. (NYSE:RAMP) announced revenue growth of 9% year-over-year to $212 million. Management highlighted a significant strategic partnership with Publicis and the expansion of its Data Marketplace to include AI models and agents, which they believe positions the firm for double-digit growth in fiscal year 2027. While the company is successfully growing its high-value million-dollar-plus accounts, subscription net retention compressed to 101%, and gross margins are expected to dip slightly as backend platform upgrades conclude. Looking ahead to FQ4, LiveRamp projected a sequential increase in operating expenses of $15 million due to seasonal events and compensation adjustments, while providing a full-year revenue guidance range of $810 million to $814 million.

Brandon Renfro, CFP® Thu, February 19, 2026 at 9:00 PM PST 5 min read Financial advisor and columnist Brandon Renfro SmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below. I am 70 and I have $1.4 million in traditional IRAs. Is it best to do $160,000 in Roth conversions for the next 1-3 years to reduce my high RMDs in about 5-10 years? That would put me in the 24% tax bracket and $330 Medicare premium rate. Please give me advice. – Dennis I do think you’re on the right track to at least be considering this. There are plenty of good reasons that Roth conversions could make sense. As I’m sure you’re aware, a lot depends on the specifics of your circumstances and what your end goals are. I’ll go through some of the considerations here that will hopefully help you decide what is best for you. Do you need additional help with decisions like Roth conversions? Speak with a financial advisor today . When Do Roth Conversions Make Sense? There are several reasons why a Roth conversion could make sense. From a tax perspective, Roth conversions make sense when you believe you are in a lower marginal tax bracket now than you might be in later. Since the money will be taxed at some point, why not decide to do it when you’ll take the smallest tax hit? Roth conversions also increase the control you have over your retirement savings since Roth IRA accounts aren’t subject to required minimum distributions (RMDs) . This means it’s up to you to decide when you’ll withdraw money, based solely on your individual wants and needs. Converting pre-tax accounts into Roth accounts may also make sense if you think you’ll end up leaving the money to heirs who are in a higher tax bracket than you. If they inherit a pre-tax account, they will have to withdraw the money and include it on their own tax return . By converting the money into Roth assets, you will increase the after-tax value of their inheritance. (A financial advisor can help you learn and decide on a Roth conversion.) How to Decide A retiree looks over his IRA balances and calculates his RMDs. It sounds like you’re primarily thinking about the tax implications of Roth conversions, and possibly the flexibility that reduced RMDs may offer. If so, I suggest estimating what you think your taxable income is going to be in a few years if you don’t do any Roth conversions. Then, compare it to what it might be if you do. This will require you to make some assumptions about the return you expect for your investments since your RMDs are a function of your age and account balances. You can then compare your tax liability now with what you think it might be in the future. When you do this comparison, you’ll also have to make some assumptions about future tax rates. Story Continues From a pure tax perspective, it would make sense to convert if you think paying 24% now will save you money over time. And yes, you are absolutely correct to consider ancillary effects like Medicare surcharges or changes to your combined income for Social Security taxation . (But if you need more help with your retirement income plan, consider matching with a financial advisor .) Current Tax Rates vs. Future Tax Rates Politicians decide tax laws, and I am the last person who would have you believe that I have any insight into what they may or may not do. I am also not in the business of predicting the future. However, my personal belief is that tax rates are likely to be higher in the future than they are today for a few reasons. The simplest reason is the current tax law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) is due to sunset at the end of 2025. Unless Congress extends provisions of the law, the personal federal income tax rates will return to pre-TCJA levels in 2026. This is simply the truth as we know it today. I personally use this as the baseline assumption when working through this decision with clients. Then, there is logic. We are in a whole dadgum lot of debt as a country. We will eventually have to pay for that debt somehow. Couple that with the fact that our current income tax environment is very low compared to historical averages and it seems reasonable that we should expect taxes to go up in the future. (A financial advisor can help you interpret tax laws and how they could affect your retirement plans.) Bottom Line A couple looks over their retirement accounts together. Roth conversions make sense if you believe you’ll save money by paying taxes now rather than later. They can also work if you want more control over your withdrawals or want to leave your heirs tax-free assets. While you can’t predict future tax rates, you’ll have to make some assumptions about what your tax rate may be later on in order to calculate whether Roth conversions are viable. My personal belief is that tax rates will go up at some point, and using the expiration of the TCJA can be a baseline to start with. Tips for Finding a Financial Advisor Finding a financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have free introductory calls with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If you’re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now . Consider a few advisors before settling on one. It’s important to make sure you find someone you trust to manage your money. As you consider your options, these are the questions you should ask an advisor in an interview. Keep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks .

      "content": "Is Walmart’s Yearly ‘Humble Brag’ Obscuring the Retailer’s Strength? Sean Craig Thu, February 19, 2026 at 9:01 PM PST 3 min read WMT AMZN DASH New Walmart CEO John Furner took on the company’s hallowed role of greeter Thursday (or “ customer host ” as they’re now called) on his first earnings call as top boss. So fresh in the job that he updated his LinkedIn page a couple of weeks ago (CEOs, they’re just like us!), Furner had good news: US same-store sales rose a better-than-expected 4.6% in the latest quarter, the last of Walmart’s fiscal 2026. But the retailer’s stock fell 1.4% as the new boss carried on a company tradition: a cautious, conservative outlook that many analysts view as a buy signal.

READ ALSO: Tariff Costs Triple for Midsized US Businesses: JPMorgan and DoorDash Delivers Fresh Profits with a Soggy Forecast ‘A Beatable Bar’ Because of Walmart’s longtime status as America’s biggest brick-and-mortar retailer, its results double as a bellwether of consumer spending. Revenue rose 5.6% year over year to $190.7 billion in the fourth quarter, good for an earnings beat. Furner’s also taking the reins at a crossroads, with his company trying to expand its position in the hypercompetitive e-commerce sector. On this point, Thursday saw another plus: Walmart’s US online sales rose 27%, marking the 15th quarter in a row of double-digit increases. It suggests that forward-thinking initiatives, such as a partnership with OpenAI to enable Walmart purchases within ChatGPT, are beginning to pay dividends. It’s worth noting that Furner said the majority of gains came “from households making more than $100,000,” continuing a trend of wealthy shoppers turning to bargain retailers for respite from inflation and consumer anxiety. And therein lies the reason that Walmart shares slid on Thursday. The company’s guidance, which calls for sales growth of 3.5% to 4.5% in fiscal 2027, trailed the 5% Wall Street expected because of consumer uncertainty. Take your pick of “whatever your favorite macro statistic to point to is” and you’ll find reason for caution, Furner said. He flagged “the hiring recession” (or what economists have dubbed the job market’s “ low-hire, low-fire ” mode), elevated student loan delinquencies , and trade uncertainty. Walmart’s conservatism seems to fit the US economy’s peculiar imbalance of sound GDP growth with a tough labor market and historically weak consumer sentiment . But caution is also something of a company ritual to start the year, one that can obscure the stock’s true value: “While Walmart is winning profitable market share and driving positive traffic, historically, management tends to be conservative when providing its initial guide for the year ahead,” Evercore ISI analysts wrote before the report. “We suspect that [Walmart] wants to set a beatable bar,” D.A. Davidson said in a note to clients. “Any weakness on that guide should be bought, in our view.” Walmart shares have climbed 12% this year, outpacing the S&P 500, and the company plans to spend $30 billion on new buybacks. Story Continues Welcome to the Jungle: Despite its strength, Walmart will have to settle for being the second-biggest company in the world by revenue, as it fell behind e-commerce rival Amazon, which made $716.9 billion last year. The torch was officially passed when Fortune said Thursday that Amazon will now sit atop the Fortune 500, ending a 13-year streak for Walmart and its measly $713.2 billion in 2026 revenue.

The delivery giant’s revenue in the winter quarter climbed 38% from the same time last year for a total that’s flirting with $4 billion. The app notched about 903 million orders, a 32% jump, as coffee-table diners double-dashed breakfast burritos and ramen. Orders were boosted by DoorDash’s October acquisition of British delivery app Deliveroo — without the new app, DoorDash orders still climbed about 20%. But feast could turn to famine this year. DoorDash, whose shares have dropped nearly 20% this year, lowered its first-quarter forecast. The company expects supersized investments into its technology, along with an international push and winter storms, to bite into its earnings.

READ ALSO: Is Walmart’s Yearly ‘Humble Brag’ Obscuring the Retailer’s Strength? and Tariff Costs Triple for Midsized US Businesses: JPMorgan Spending Money to Make Money DoorDash shares had their biggest one-day drop ever in November, when the company announced plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars improving its platform and business. Investors at the time had already grown skittish about large investments into unguaranteed futures as tech companies poured hundreds of billions into AI. Now, investors know more about the details of DoorDash’s self-improvement plan, and yes, it does include AI: DoorDash is working to integrate its three delivery businesses — DoorDash, Deliveroo and EU-favorite Wolt — into a single platform that it says will be more efficient. The company’s spending push also focuses on both agentic and physical AI. The AI agents could facilitate more orders for the delivery company, while AI-powered autonomous vehicles could cut costs. DoorDash said its research and development expenses had already surged 41% last year. DoorDash is also investing in the last mile of delivery with robots and drones (some of the bots have heart eyes ). These last-mile solutions could give DoorDash an edge in grocery delivery compared with rivals like Amazon. Global Ambitions: DoorDash is looking to make its plan pay off in the second half of the year, which could catapult it higher up the list of apps people order fried rice on. In the US, DoorDash dominates the delivery industry with more than double the order volume of its closest competitor, Uber Eats, according to Consumer Edge and Fortune . Deliveroo and Wolt, meanwhile, have strong presences abroad but still face stiff competition from rivals like Just Eat. This post first appeared on The Daily Upside .

Last year, in spite of (or because of) the White House’s aggressive tariff campaign, the US trade deficit of goods reached a record high, according to data Thursday from the US Commerce Department. In other words, tariffs haven’t really altered the behavior of US consumers and companies. But according to a JPMorgan report published Thursday , the tariffs are definitely making life tougher for mid-sized companies. SUBSCRIBE: Receive more of our free The Daily Upside newsletter. READ ALSO: Is Walmart’s Yearly ‘Humble Brag’ Obscuring the Retailer’s Strength? and DoorDash Delivers Fresh Profits with a Soggy Forecast Beat the Rush Imports into the US climbed 4.7% last year to $4.3 trillion, while exports rose 6.2% to $3.5 trillion. That places the total trade deficit for goods and services at $901.5 billion, a slight tick down from 2024 levels but still one of the highest on record since 1960. Part of the increase — but not all of it — can be attributed to the rush of imports at the beginning of the year, when ports were overwhelmed by companies trying to frontload supply ahead of the expected tariff regime. The deficit proved as volatile as the on-again, off-again nature of global trade negotiations, plummeting to the lowest point since 2009 in October before stabilizing at normal levels in December, according to the Commerce Department. So what does that mean? For the most part, companies and consumers alike (who bear the bulk of tariff costs, according to New York Fed economists ) grit their teeth and pay the new import taxes. For midsized firms, which largely lack the ability to dictate trade terms or shuffle their supply chains, tariffs proved a major pain: According to an analysis of transaction data, JPMorgan found that midsized companies — those that make $10 million to $1 billion in revenue or have 50 to 499 workers — paid roughly triple the tariff payments they shouldered in 2024. Overall, outflows to foreign companies remained relatively stable in 2025. A majority of midsized firms conduct international transactions, and nearly half do business with at least two other countries. Relationship Game: Per JPMorgan analysts, long-term supplier relationships are valuable to midsized companies, which made many hesitant to find a new supplier in a different country. Still, business outflows to China dropped 27% last year — a figure that aligns neatly with the 30% overall decrease in Chinese imports reported by the Commerce Department. After all that, it seems tariffs didn’t change how much Americans import, but rather how they do so. This post first appeared on The Daily Upside .

      "content": "Wall Street keeps calm after the Supreme Court strikes down Trump's tariffs STAN CHOE Thu, February 19, 2026 at 9:21 PM PST 5 min read ^GSPC ^DJI ^IXIC NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street kept calm Friday after the Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs , which had triggered panic in financial markets when announced last year, and stocks ticked higher. The S&P 500 rose 0.7%. It had been flipping between small gains and losses before the court’s ruling, following discouraging reports showing slowing growth for the U.S. economy and faster inflation . The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 230 points, or 0.5%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.9%. Many on Wall Street were likely expecting such a ruling from the Supreme Court, according to Brian Jacobsen, chief economic strategist at Annex Wealth Management. That likely led to the relatively muted reactions across financial markets, and trading remained tentative as investors tried to suss out the long-term effects. Tariffs also aren’t going away , even with the Supreme Court’s ruling. Trump in the afternoon said he would use other avenues to put taxes on imports from other countries after calling the court’s decision terrible. “Just so you understand, we have tariffs, we just have them in a different way,” Trump told reporters in an afternoon briefing. He said he would sign an executive order to impose a 10% global tariff under a law that could limit it to 150 days. The president also said he’s exploring other tariffs through other avenues, ones that would require an investigation through the Commerce Department. “During that period of about five months, we are doing the various investigations necessary to put fair tariffs – or tariffs, period – on other countries,” Trump said. Earlier in his comments, Trump said that the Supreme Court’s ruling had other countries “dancing in the streets, but they won’t be dancing for long.” Among the tentative moves across markets, Treasury yields edged a bit higher in the bond market. If investors thought the tariff ruling would improve inflation significantly, it could have sent yields lower. On the other hand, if investors were worried about the U.S. government’s debt rising faster in the future because of the loss of revenue from tariffs, long-term yields could have jumped. For now, at least, yields held relatively steady. The stock price of Ralph Lauren, meanwhile, rushed from an early loss to a gain of 3.3% after investors learned of the Supreme Court’s ruling. But it quickly flipped back to a loss before finishing with a rise of 2.2%. During April last year, the stock had dropped nearly 23% in four days after Trump announced his tariffs because of worries about how they would hurt its profits. Story Continues In other markets, gold’s price slumped briefly after the ruling and then erased the loss. Stock indexes in Europe added to their gains from earlier in the day, while the U.S. dollar’s value edged down against other currencies. Heading into the day, the main event for markets had seemed to be discouraging reports showing slowing U.S. economic growth and accelerating inflation. They found a relatively muted response from investors. While the reports underscore the tricky situation the Federal Reserve faces as it sets interest rates, they did not change traders’ expectations much for what the Fed will ultimately do. Traders are still betting that the Fed will lower rates at least twice this year, according to data from CME Group. Some shifted bets for the timing of when the cuts could begin to slightly later in the summer. Lower interest rates would give the economy and investment prices a boost, but they also risk worsening inflation. Fed officials said at their last meeting that they want to see inflation fall further before they would support cutting rates further. The yield on the 10-year Treasury remained at 4.08%, where it was late Thursday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, inched up to 3.48% from 3.47%. On Wall Street, Akamai Technologies dropped 14.1% for one of the market’s sharpest losses. The cybersecurity and cloud computing company reported stronger results for the end of 2025 than analysts expected, but it gave a profit forecast for the upcoming year that fell short of estimates. Akamai plans to spend a bigger percentage of its revenue this upcoming year on equipment and other investments. It’s the latest potential indicator of how shortages of computer memory created by the AI boom are affecting customers throughout the economy. On the winning side of the market was Comfort Systems, which rose 6.5% after the provider of heating, ventilation, air conditioning and electrical services reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Brian Lane said his company is seeing “unprecedented demand.” Al told, the S&P 500 rose 47.62 points to 6,909.51. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 230.81 to 49,625.97, and the Nasdaq composite rose 203.34 to 22,886.07. In stock markets abroad, indexes rose in Europe following a more mixed finish in Asia. The Hang Seng fell 1.1%, but South Korea’s Kospi jumped 2.3% to a record, led by major defense contractors like Hanwha Aerospace. The company is one of many benefiting from a ramp up in military spending in many countries. ___ AP Writers Matt Ott, Elaine Kurtenbach and Seung Min Kim contributed.

(ORLY) ranks among the premier automotive aftermarket retailers. Valued at approximately $78.3 billion, it equips professional repair shops and do-it-yourself customers with replacement parts, maintenance supplies, tools, equipment, and private-label products Over the past 52 weeks, O'Reilly’s shares have risen nearly 9%, slightly trailing the S&P 500 Index ($SPX), which gained 11.7% over the same period. Year-to-date (YTD), the stock has climbed 3.3%, neatly outpacing the broader index’s modest uptick.

Compared with its sector, the State Street Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLY) climbed 2.8% over the last 52 weeks but dropped 2.7% YTD, highlighting O'Reilly's relative stability amid sector volatility. www.barchart.com On Feb. 4, ORLY stock edged lower and then slid another 4% the next day after O'Reilly posted its Q4 fiscal 2025 earnings results. During the quarter, revenue rose 7.8% year over year to $4.41 billion, essentially in line with the $4.39 billion analyst estimate. EPS came in at $0.71, just shy of the $0.72 estimate. However, it grew 12.7% from the year-ago period. Still, the quarter carried more muscle than the headline suggested. Comparable store sales rose a robust 5.6% in Q4, pushing full-year 2025 comps to 4.7%, which reached the high end of revised guidance. Management also set a confident tone for fiscal 2026, guiding EPS to a range of $3.10 to $3.20, which implies 6.1% growth at the midpoint over 2025. Growth does not stop at earnings. The company plans to open 225 to 235 net new stores in 2026, including expansion into Canada. For the full fiscal year 2026, ending in December, analysts expect diluted EPS to grow 8.1% year over year to $3.21. While O'Reilly beat EPS estimates in two of the past four quarters and missed in the other two, it has consistently operated within a close range of expectations. Wall Street continues to assign ORLY stock an overall rating of “Strong Buy.” Of the 28 analysts covering the stock, 20 recommend “Strong Buy,” three suggest “Moderate Buy,” while five call for “Hold.” www.barchart.com Sentiment has remained mostly unchanged from three months ago, when 20 analysts also assigned the stock a “Strong Buy” rating. Story Continues Recent analyst actions add further texture. On Feb. 6, Michael Baker of DA Davidson reiterated his “Buy” rating and maintained a $110 price target, underscoring continued faith in execution. On Feb. 10, Steven Zaccone of Citigroup Inc. (C) also maintained a “Buy” rating, though he trimmed the price target from $114 to $110, signaling a slightly more cautious valuation stance while preserving confidence in the company’s trajectory. Importantly, upside potential still frames the broader narrative. ORLY’s average price target of $108.04 represents potential upside of 14.7%. Meanwhile, the Street-high target of $120 suggests a gain of 27.4% from current levels.

      "content": "Ask an Advisor: Can I Retire at 60 With $1.1M Cash, $880K in a 401(k), Pensions and Social Security? Brandon Renfro, CFP® Thu, February 19, 2026 at 11:00 PM PST 6 min read I am 60 years old, married, with no mortgage. We also have $1.1 million in liquid cash and $880,000 in a 401(k).  I will have two pensions, which have not started yet, and my wife will have one pension, all three adding up to approximately $3,500 a month if we took them today. Also, we have paid into Social Security. At 65 years old, we’ll pull in roughly $5,000 a month combined. I will have medical and dental insurance through my state government for me and my wife as long as we live. Not sure if I can retire now or wait a few more years to build on my pension? -Fred The answer to questions like this is always, “It depends.” Yes, there is certainly a heavy dose of math involved in arriving at your answer. But you still need to interpret that math and its conclusions in a way that you are comfortable with based on your own situation and attitudes toward money, security and risk. I’ll highlight some of the things you should consider as you work through your decision, but there is no way to give you a concise answer here. I strongly encourage you to do a significant amount of research if you plan to do this by yourself or consult a financial advisor . Your Expenses in Retirement Ask an Advisor: I Am 60 Years Old, Have $1.1M Cash, $880K in a 401(k), Several Pensions and Social Security. Should I Retire Now? Incomes and expenses are different for everyone in retirement, so we can’t know if your income is sufficient without knowing your expenses. Regardless of income streams (pensions or Social Security ) and the savings you have to supplement them (cash and 401(k)), it’s important to also estimate the amount you’ll need to spend each month. Doing this allows you to compare your income and expenses, just like you do while you’re still working. One way to get a rough draft of your retirement budget is to start with what you currently spend each month. From there, you can adjust based on any planned or expected changes once you retire. This might be buying a new car, taking a celebratory vacation or accounting for changes to your health insurance premiums . The fact that you have paid off your house is a major plus. Sources of Income Once you’ve estimated your expenses, consider the different sources of income you have in retirement. Some are guaranteed, while others are subject to risk through market volatility . Here’s what to look at. Pensions and Social Security I like to look at guaranteed income first. For you, that would be pensions and Social Security. Rather than dig into the nuance of when you claim your benefit (although claiming strategies are certainly something to consider), let’s go with the numbers you mentioned. At 65, you’d have about $8,500 per month coming in from fixed sources. As a side note, check to see if your pension includes an annual inflation adjustment. Story Continues Compare that with your expected expenses. How much does it cover? One third? Half? All? Of course, the ability to cover a larger portion of your expenses means more security. If you can cover them entirely, you are in a really good position, although for most people that isn’t necessary. At this step, you might also divide your expenses into necessities and wants. Separately think about how much of your necessities might be covered. If you can cover all of those with fixed sources, great. That could make you less anxious about needing to cover the remainder with your savings. A financial advisor can help you break down your budget and structure a plan. Savings Withdrawals You will need to cover the rest of your expenses by taking money from your savings. For this, you’ll want to spend some time understanding different withdrawal methods. That’s because you’ll need to decide on a distribution plan that allows you to be comfortable taking the withdrawals necessary to pay for any remaining expenses not covered by your pensions and Social Security. The big fear for most people is that they will end up running out of money too soon. A simple way to evaluate this risk would be to look at your planned withdrawal rate . As an example, let’s say you determine you’ll need to withdraw $40,000 per year from your savings. If we round your savings to $2 million, that’s a 2% withdrawal rate. Most planners would tell you that is a very conservative withdrawal rate and should leave you feeling pretty confident. Higher withdrawal rates, 10% for example, introduce significant risk. But again, you need to be comfortable with whatever you decide. Base your choice on an understanding of your income needs and the risk you are willing to take. There isn’t an objective mark to hit. Your Feelings About Risk Ask an Advisor: I Am 60 Years Old, Have $1.1M Cash, $880K in a 401(k), Several Pensions and Social Security. Should I Retire Now? As you consider your choice, consider how you feel about the different risks you’ll face. The easiest way to see this is through your investments, but they aren’t the only source of risk in retirement. Your investments necessitate a tradeoff. The more aggressive your investments are, the more chance they have to grow and support you throughout retirement. But that also means they will be more volatile and could cause you concern when the markets are rough. Very conservative investments might not be as scary to hold, but the risk is that they may not grow enough to sustain you throughout retirement. I notice that you hold roughly half of your savings in cash. Of course, I don’t know why – you may have recently inherited money or sold property and are still deciding what to do with it – but this would initially indicate to me that you are a very conservative investor. The cash can serve as a good buffer against market volatility and be especially helpful during those few years between retirement and when Social Security starts. This could also be a source of risk too since the real value of cash will fall over time as inflation withers away at its purchasing power. Consider consulting a fiduciary financial advisor for your retirement planning. What to Do Next None of what I’ve said here directly answered your question. But that’s because any answer I could give you would be incomplete and assume too much about you. There is a lot of nuance to these decisions and they are very personal. I can’t stress enough how important it is to make sure you understand your situation, your appetite for the various risks you might face and the options available to you. Make your decision based on that understanding and choose something you are comfortable with.

Wellington-Altus Chief Market Strategist James Thorne argues buying Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC ) means betting Trump’s economic reforms succeed, while buying gold is betting America fails—framing the two assets as opposing verdicts on the country’s future. The Two-America Thesis Thorne argued on X gold no longer functions as a simple inflation hedge. Rising gold demand reflects growing disbelief that Trump’s economic program can reform an economy drowning in debt. “It is the old guard’s confession that they see only one way out of excessive leverage: print, debase, and hope the music doesn’t stop,” Thorne wrote. Don't Miss: Professional traders demand transparency — see why Kraken Pro has become one of crypto's most trusted advanced trading platforms. This AI Helps Fortune 1000 Brands Avoid Costly Ad Mistakes — See Why Investors Are Paying Attention Meanwhile, the Bitcoin case rests on reform. Trump, Treasury Secretary Bessent , and Fed nominee Kevin Warsh argue America can stop paying banks to sit on cash and redirect capital from Treasury holdings back into the productive economy. If that works, growth shrinks debt rather than printing it away—making Bitcoin the right bet: “Bitcoin is a bet on Trump’s success,” Thorne wrote. Gold (NYSE: GLD ) buyers see that outcome as unlikely. They believe excessive debt leaves only one exit: devalue the currency and hope growth eventually catches up. Under that scenario, gold preserves wealth while Bitcoin’s value erodes alongside the reform narrative. Trending: Most Retirement Plans Ignore Taxes — See If Yours Does The Brutal Reckoning Ahead Thorne said gold holders face steep losses if Trump succeeds. Gold bought as protection against failure becomes a poor investment the moment America demonstrates it can grow its way out of debt. The reverse holds equally. If reforms stall, Bitcoin’s speculative premium disappears while gold’s thesis is validated. Both assets cannot be right simultaneously—the next two years will determine which verdict was correct. The Technical Decision Points See Also: Own the Characters, Not Just the Content: Inside a Fast-Growing Pre-IPO IP Company Both assets sit at critical junctures. Bitcoin is down 1% today, with the Supertrend at $67,464 flipped green just below price—an extremely thin margin. A close below $67,464 flips momentum back bearish immediately. A descending trendline from January highs and ascending trendline from the $62,000 capitulation low converge at current price. La historia continúa Breaking above $70,000 targets $75,000-$77,000. Breaking below $67,464 confirms another leg down. Meanwhile, gold is also forming a symmetrical triangle. Breaking below $4,900-$4,925 targets the 200 EMA at $4,823 or $4,700 horizontal support. Holding allows a move toward $5,100-$5,200.

Despite stable Q4 2025 results and a positive outlook for the long term, the market was concerned by persisting pressures driven by global tariffs and supply chain issues. For the full fiscal 2026, ending in October, analysts expect Agilent to deliver an EPS of $5.93, up 6.1% year-over-year. Further, the company has a steady earnings surprise history. It has surpassed or met the Street’s bottom-line projections in each of the past four quarters. Among the 18 analysts covering the Agilent stock, the consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on 12 “Strong Buy” ratings, one “Moderate Buy,” and five “Holds.” www.barchart.com This configuration is more bullish than three months ago, when there were nine “Strong Buy” ratings. Last month, HSBC initiated coverage on Agilent Technologies with a “Buy” rating and a $180 price target. Agilent’s mean price target of $171.25 represents a 35.5% premium to current price levels.

      "content": "Prediction: This Will Be Nvidia's Stock Price by the End of 2026 Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool Fri, February 20, 2026 at 1:05 AM EST 4 min read NVDA ^GSPC INTC Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been among the best performers in the stock market over the past few years, but it hasn't had a great 2026 so far. Its stock is essentially flat, as is the S&P 500 . All of that could change after it reports Q4 earnings on Feb. 25, as those results could ignite the stock to its usual form. I think 2026 could be a huge year for Nvidia stock for several reasons, but the ultimate question is, what will Nvidia's stock price be by the end of the year? The answer may shock some investors, as I think Nvidia's stock has a huge runway. Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » Image source: Nvidia. Nvidia has a few bullish catalysts emerging Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) primarily used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications. As we've heard from some of the biggest names in the AI world, capital expenditures are expected to be massive in 2026. Amazon expects to spend $200 billion, Alphabet anywhere from $175 billion and $185 billion, while Meta Platforms intends to spend $115 billion to $135 billion. Those are massive projections, and don't include any numbers from some players like OpenAI or Microsoft . It's clear that 2026 will be a monster year for AI spending, and Nvidia is one of the primary companies that's set to cash in. Another growth driver in 2026 will be the return of sales to China. In April 2025, President Donald Trump and his administration barred Nvidia and its peers from exporting computing units to China. This was a problem, as Nvidia specifically developed a GPU to meet export restrictions that it was now stuck with. However, it appears that Chinese sales have been approved once again, though Nvidia will have to pay an export tax. China is a massive AI market, and the impact will be felt in Nvidia's fiscal year (FY) 2027 results, ending January 2027. All of this adds up to what's expected to be a far better year, and the projections back it up. Wall Street analysts project that Nvidia's growth rate will be 65% in FY 2027, up from 57% in FY 2026. On the earnings per share (EPS) side, they expect Nvidia's to increase from $4.69 to $7.74. That $7.74 in earnings per share is what we'll base our valuation on. Nvidia's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio decreased in 2025 to average about 45 times trailing earnings. NVDA PE Ratio data by YCharts To bake a bit of conservatism into this projection, I'll set an end price of 40 times earnings for Nvidia's stock. If it does that and meets analyst EPS projections, then Nvidia's stock price would be $309.60. That's a massive jump from today's $185 share price, and if Nvidia beats EPS estimates, like it has consistently done over the past few years, and trades for a higher multiple, that price could be even greater. Story Continues Nvidia stock is a no-brainer buy right now, and I could see it crossing over $300 per share before 2026 is over. Should you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "content": "Beyond SoFi Stock: This Other Cash-Gushing Bank Stock Is Worth Your Money Thomas Niel, The Motley Fool Fri, February 20, 2026 at 1:20 AM EST 4 min read SOFI NVDA INTC Investors may have decided to \"sell the news\" on SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI) . However, while shares could stay in a slump in the near term, the digital-first bank's growth story remains intact. SoFi's membership growth continues at a moderate pace. This points to further revenue growth at a moderate pace, and to even more rapid earnings growth. In turn, this could help SoFi sustain its elevated valuation, with the stock moving higher over time, in line with earnings growth. Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » However, while you may want to hold onto existing SoFi positions, or perhaps buy this stock if you've yet to do so, I've got another promising bank stock to include in a diversified, long-term-focused portfolio. Image source: Getty Images. An undervalued bank stock on the grow For the year that ended Dec. 31, 2025, SoFi reported 37% year-over-year revenue growth and a 111% increase in adjusted net income. In terms of guidance, SoFi's management anticipates revenue and earnings-per-share (EPS) growth of 30% and 54%, respectively, next year. Over a longer time frame, sell-side analysts anticipate SoFi's EPS to grow by 31% in 2027, 17.5% in 2028, and nearly 14% in 2029. In short, the bull case for SoFi Technologies is pretty straightforward. As the growth story continues, it's easy to envision shares rallying in line with increased earnings. Furthermore, the bull case behind SoFi reminds me a lot of the bull case with another bank stock, one considered an undervalued stock rather than a growth stock. Don't get me wrong. I'm not about to drop on you some sort of value-trap bank stock, or a bank trading at a low valuation, but with questionable growth potential. Rather, the bank I'm thinking about, Citigroup (NYSE: C) , could be considered an undervalued bank stock \"on the grow.\" That is, shares are cheaply priced, despite it being is in the midst of a growth resurgence. Why Citigroup is a top buy-and-hold choice Since late 2023, Citigroup shares have been surging higher. This is due to the success of CEO Jane Fraser's long-term turnaround of the money center bank. Through efforts ranging from downsizing to aggressive share repurchases, the bank has experienced steady improvement in its operating performance. In 2024, Citigroup reported 3% revenue growth and 38% earnings growth. In 2025, excluding one-time items, the bank reported 6.5% revenue growth and 26.7% earnings growth. EPS increased 35%, to $7.97. La historia continúa Citigroup shares have more than doubled during this time frame, but further upside may lie ahead. The bank continues to implement cost-cutting measures, including recently announced plans for layoffs starting in March. An ongoing consolidation of its retail banking and wealth management divisions could also yield growth and cost synergies. In 2026 and 2027, sell-side analysts anticipate EPS to hit $10.23 and $12.03, respectively. If coupled with a rerating, this could mean further meaningful upside for shares. Right now, Citigroup trades for only 10.8 times forward earnings. Peers like Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase trade at forward multiples of 12 to 14. If shares rerate, the stock could rally by more than 50% between now and 2027. Given this appreciation potential, I believe Citigroup is another top financial stock to buy and hold. Should you buy stock in Citigroup right now?

      "content": "Entergy Corporation (ETR) Charts Path for Growth Amid Mixed Results Abdul Rahman Fri, February 20, 2026 at 3:09 AM EST 2 min read ETR Entergy Corporation (NYSE: ETR ) is one of the best infrastructure stocks to buy right now . On February 12, Entergy Corporation (NYSE:ETR) shared its Q4 2025 earnings. Quarterly EPS came in at $0.51, 5.6% below the Street’s consensus. Meanwhile, earnings reached $236 million, down from $286 million in Q4 2024. A financial advisor consulting with investors on their portfolio in a large boardroom. For the full year, adjusted EPS reached $3.91, up 7% year over year. Full-year adjusted earnings were $1.76 billion, which management said were boosted by regulatory actions, higher retail sales volumes (including weather), other income gains, returns on construction work-in-progress, and lower nuclear refueling outages. On a full-year basis, utility business earnings attributable to Entergy totaled $2.28 billion, or $5.06 per share. The revenue was offset by higher interest expense, O&M, depreciation, and non-income taxes. On the contrary, the Parent & Other segment posted a $521 million loss, or $1.16 per share. Nonetheless, this was an improvement from the prior year, said management, due to resolved legacy contracts and other adjustments. During the year, the company secured approvals for major projects like Jefferson Power Station (Arkansas), West Bank 500 kV transmission (Louisiana), Cypress-Legend 500 kV (Texas), and Google’s special contract. It also filed for more, including Cottonwood acquisition and solar/battery builds. The company was also ranked top utility for economic development for the 18th year running and earned the EEI award for volunteerism. ​Against the backdrop, the executives guided adjusted EPS to range from $4.25 to $4.45, which is a 9-14% growth midpoint. Entergy Corporation (NYSE:ETR) is a New Orleans, Louisiana-based utility company. It generates and distributes electricity to 3 million customers across Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. The company operates a diverse fleet of power plants, including nuclear, natural gas, coal, and renewable facilities. While we acknowledge the potential of ETR as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "content": "TD aims to retain its branch ‘essence’ amid brand refresh Caitlin Mullen Fri, February 20, 2026 at 12:50 AM EST 5 min read SAN This story was originally published on Banking Dive . To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Banking Dive newsletter . When TD gets customers, it doesn’t lose them, executive Marc Womack said. But maintaining that position amid a highly competitive landscape in which it’s easier than ever to open accounts and move money digitally requires adaptation, he noted. More from Yahoo Scout What impact did TD's AML settlement have on operations? What strategies is TD using to deepen customer relationships? How is TD balancing digital transformation with human connection? How is TD Bank adapting to increasing deposit competition? “That’s really our focus going forward: How do we make sure that, as the market moves and as capabilities and expectations change, that we’re changing with those expectations so that we can continue to deliver that for our customers?” said Womack, the bank’s head of U.S. consumer deposit and payment products. He joined the U.S. subsidiary of Toronto-based TD in August , after a stint at Santander, where he was h ead of operations for their consumer finance business . Prior to that, Womack served as president and CEO for TD Auto Finance. Competition for deposits “is probably as fierce as it’s been in a long time,” Womack said during a recent interview. That’s driven by the number and variety of banks, fintechs and credit unions chasing deposits, but also by interest rate dynamics. U.S. Bank’s CFO recently noted the competitive deposit market during the bank’s latest earnings call, saying “not many peers grew consumer deposits” last year. JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. lender, expects lower growth this year than originally projected, partly due to persistent yield-seeking behavior. There will always be consumers moving for the best rate, and TD captures “a fair bit of those customers,” Womack said. But many others double down on getting what they need from their current bank, he said. “That's the place where we have historically played and where we will continue to play,” Womack said. The bank monitors retail deposits daily, he said. “We want to make sure that not only are we bringing in the right customers, but we’re also making sure that the ones that we have are not falling out of the bottom of the bucket,” he said. Refreshing the brand Since the bank’s historic anti-money laundering settlement was announced in October 2024, TD has “maintained stable deposit levels with minimal customer attrition,” U.S. CEO Leo Salom said last September during the bank’s investor day. A $434 billion asset cap was placed on its U.S. retail banking operations, as the bank was ordered by regulators to pay more than $3 billion in fines and address its AML deficiencies. TD completed most management remediation actions last year. Earlier this month, the bank refreshed its brand , launching a marketing campaign with the tagline “More Human.” The rebrand “reflects how our business is evolving alongside consumer expectations,” said Jennie Platt, chief marketing officer for TD Bank U.S. “ As everyday banking becomes increasingly digital, we believe human connection becomes even more important.” Story Continues At TD’s investor day, executives laid out goals of boosting digital adoption to 70% and driving digital self-serve above 90%. U.S. retail counts about 10 million clients, and about 5.2 million are mobile users, as of the bank’s fiscal fourth quarter . The lender reports quarterly earnings Feb. 26. “Consumers expect speed, transparency and control when they’re managing routine transactions, so we’ve focused on simplifying our digital tools and making them easier to use,” Platt said. “At the same time, financial decisions such as buying a home, planning for retirement or growing a business are still deeply personal. In those moments, clients value experienced bankers who understand their goals and the communities they serve.” Finding relationship depth TD has been a “very store-centric” organization, historically, Womack said. “We have to retain the essence of that whether in the physical or in the digital.” That includes ensuring added digital capabilities are easy for customers to find. “What we're really trying to do is to expand the impact of the things that customers like about us into those channels, into those products, into those capabilities, rather than trying to wholesale pivot to be something that we aren't,” he said. “We don’t try to out-fintech fintechs,” he said. “That’s not who we are.” His team is also mulling how to better personalize initial engagement and onboarding with the bank, to identify what customers need and want to do, and angling to do more for customer segments that find TD most appealing. Salom has said the bank lacks relationship depth with many of its U.S. customers. As TD regains its U.S. footing following the AML challenges, Trump-appointed regulators have given the green light to sizable bank deals and new entrants seeking charters. Amid rapid industry change, Womack said he’s confident TD has the right plans, but “if the wind changes and it blows in our face, how do we make sure that we’re being as nimble as we can to address those things?” “Are we moving fast enough, in every way, to really address the needs of our customers?” he said. Womack said he doesn’t lose sleep at night “because bank XYZ offers 10 basis points higher in rate than me,” or a competitor offers “another click less in the [account] opening process.” “At the most macro things, there's a bar that you have to make sure that you're chinning, and below that bar, you are at a disadvantage,” he said. “But on some of those dimensions, being way out in front doesn't necessarily advantage you as much as” when “you balance with everything else that we're trying to do,” he said.

Although BofA anticipates steady revenue momentum across all business sectors, the revision reflects the firm’s expectation of pressure on Sea’s e-commerce margins from ongoing investments in Southeast Asia, Taiwan, and Brazil. ​Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) is a leading internet and technology company based in Singapore. It operates across three main business segments: Digital Entertainment, E-commerce, and Digital Financial Services. While we acknowledge the potential of SE as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "content": "Cathie Wood Goes Bargain Hunting: 3 Stocks She Just Bought Will Healy, The Motley Fool Fri, February 20, 2026 at 3:45 AM CST 5 min read SHOP NVDA INTC Cathie Wood and her team manage several funds under the company's umbrella. These funds trade actively, buying or selling where the team feels it is appropriate. Amid the turmoil during this season, Wood's team has made some key purchases for Ark Invest . These stocks could boost the fund and investors who follow their lead. Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » Image source: Getty Images. 1. Shopify On Feb. 11 and 12, Ark Invest added significantly to its holdings of Shopify (NASDAQ: SHOP) . Across three of its funds, it invested $31.6 million into this company, increasing its holdings by nearly 10%. After the purchases, Shopify is Ark Invest's seventh-largest holding, making up 3.2% of the fund. Along with many other SaaS stocks , Shopify has sold off this year as artificial intelligence (AI) has become adept at replacing many software platforms at a lower cost. Fortunately, Shopify is an e-commerce ecosystem that is adopting AI tools to stay on top. Judging by the 30% yearly revenue growth in 2025, the company's growth remains rapid. That is not to say the stock does not face some challenges. The 2025 profits of $1.2 billion shrunk 39% from last year amid a huge income tax benefit in 2024. Also, analysts' forecasts of 28% revenue growth in 2026 and 26% in 2027 mean growth rates may be slowing modestly. Furthermore, at a P/E ratio of 120 and a forward P/E of 61, some investors may be leery of the valuation. Still, fears of AI replacing its software will likely not come to pass. For that reason, Ark Invest's decision to add shares should pay off longer term. 2. Robinhood Ark Invest bought six different lots of Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ: HOOD) stock on Feb. 11 and 12. It made $46.4 million in purchases, adding to the total holdings by 16%. As a result, Robinhood is now the fund's eighth-largest holding, making up just over 3.1% of the fund. Robinhood has stood out for commission-free trading of stocks and a platform that is easy to use, making it attractive for traders who may not have opened an account with an existing brokerage firm. Like most tech-related stocks, it plummeted in 2022. However, in 2024, the stock recovered as it entered prediction markets, cryptocurrency, and credit cards, and it introduced a platform with expanded research and trading features in Robinhood Gold. With that, it was concerns about crypto that helped lead to a sell-off in the last weeks of 2025, taking the stock down by more than 50% from that high. Story Continues Additionally, investors should note that its Q4 yearly revenue growth of 27% was below the 52% increase in 2025. Also, 2025 net income grew by only 33%, though a loss of its income tax benefit caused the slower profit growth relative to revenue. Still, its P/E ratio has fallen to about 37. That level is attractive relative to Robinhood's growth, making it easy to see why Ark Invest added to its stake. 3. Roblox The fund also added to its Roblox (NYSE: RBLX) holdings on Feb. 10 and 13. These purchases added up to around $20.3 million, adding to its holdings by 8%. This makes Roblox Ark Invest's 13th-largest holding, constituting 2.6% of total holdings. Like its other purchases, Roblox has pulled back close to 60% from its high last September amid some challenges in its financials. Roblox's user-created games and community gaming platform remain attractive, with daily active users rising 69% year over year to 144 million. From that standpoint, one can understand why Ark Invest added to its position amid the pullback. Still, despite its growth potential, Roblox investors face significant risks. In 2025, revenue grew by 31% yearly. The company forecasts a 23% to 29% increase in 2026, which may have soured investors on the stock. Also, losses actually rose to $1.07 billion from $935 million as costs and expense growth kept pace with revenue increases. That loss is primarily due to the $1.13 billion in stock-based compensation during 2025, a non-cash expense. Consequently, it generated about $1.36 billion in free cash flow, meaning it can fund its operations. Also, with its loss, it has no P/E ratio. Nonetheless, its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio has fallen to 9, greatly lowering Ark Invest's risk of buying the stock now. Should you buy stock in Shopify right now?

Meanwhile, the balance of the buyback program will be made from time to time, which may be through open market purchases and privately negotiated transactions. Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC) said that the total amount of share repurchases is not guaranteed, as it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. In other news, Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC) swung to a net loss of $54.5 million last year from a $1.48 billion net income in 2024. Revenues, however, were higher by 10 percent at $17.27 billion, versus $15.69 billion year-on-year.

      "content": "Ethereum Struggles Below $2,000, Yet BitMine Sees Rebound: Here’s What They’re Watching Kamina Bashir Fri, February 20, 2026 at 3:43 AM CST 3 min read ETH-USD BMNR Ethereum (ETH) is holding below $2,000, leaving many investors underwater as the downtrend extends into February 2026. Despite the sustained weakness, BitMine has maintained a bullish stance on Ethereum. This raises a key question: Is their confidence driven by narrative or sentiment, or is there another factor behind their conviction? Ethereum’s Pain Reaches 9th Decile: What Does That Mean For The Price? In a detailed post on X (formerly Twitter), BitMine highlighted the research by Sean Farrell, Fundstrat’s Head of Digital Asset Strategy, focusing on Ethereum’s realized price. This is an on-chain valuation metric that reflects the average acquisition cost of all coins currently in circulation. According to the data, Ethereum’s realized price stands at $2,241. At the time of the analysis, the asset was trading near $1,934. This leaves the average holder in the red. According to Fundstrat’s model, the “loss for realized price was 22%.” Ethereum’s Realized Price Analysis Showing the Gap Between On-Chain Cost Basis and Market Price. Source: X/BitMine The analysis compared the current drawdown to prior cycle lows. During the 2022 bear market, Ethereum traded as much as 39% below its realized price. In 2025, the discount reached approximately 21%. “If we apply this 'loss' to the current realized ETH price of $2,241, we get implied 'lows' for ETH. Using 2022, this implies $1,367. Using 2025, this implies $1,770,” the analysis noted. Using a decile analysis, the post revealed that the current drawdown falls into the 9th decile (extremely high). For context, a decile analysis is a quantitative method used in statistics, finance, and marketing to segment a dataset into 10 equal-sized groups (deciles) based on the distribution of a specific variable. The data suggests that the median 12-month forward return in this decile was approximately 81%, with a 12-month win ratio of 87%. In other words, in most historical instances when ETH reached similar drawdown levels, it was trading higher one year later. “Is this the bottom? Seems like we are closing in on that low. Looking beyond the near-term, the risk/reward for ETH is positive,” the post read. ETH Returns by Decile. Source: X/BitMine BitMine Chairman Tom Lee previously emphasized that sharp drawdowns are a recurring feature of Ethereum’s price history. Since 2018, ETH has experienced eight separate declines of 50% or more from local highs, suggesting that corrections of this magnitude have occurred roughly once per year. In 2025, Ethereum fell 64% between January and March. Despite that steep drop, the asset later rebounded significantly. \"ETH sees V-shaped recoveries from major lows. This happened in each of the 8 prior declines of 50% or more. A similar recovery is expected in 2026. The best investment opportunities in crypto have presented themselves after declines. Think back to 2025, the single best entry points in crypto occurred after markets fell sharply due to tariff concerns,\" Lee said. Story Continues Ethereum Recovery Could Be Critical for BitMine’s $7 Billion Underwater Position If Ethereum delivers a sustained recovery with strong upside returns, it could represent a meaningful inflection point for investors, particularly BitMine. The company’s unrealized losses have expanded to approximately $7 billion, according to CryptoQuant data. BitMine Unrealized Losses on Ethereum Holdings. Source: CryptoQuant At the same time, BitMine appears to be reinforcing its bullish stance through continued accumulation. Lookonchain reported that the firm purchased 10,000 ETH from Kraken today. This transaction followed a much larger single-day acquisition of 35,000 ETH. BitMine acquired 20,000 ETH from BitGo and 15,000 ETH from FalconX. Taken together, the purchases suggest that despite mounting unrealized losses, BitMine is positioning for a potential upside scenario rather than reducing exposure.

This growth was driven by the Electronics & Packaging segment, which surged 19% compared to the prior year, due to capacity expansions in chemistry and flex drilling equipment. The company concluded the full year with $3.9 billion in total revenue. A primary driver for the company’s current success is the rapid adoption of AI technology, which is reshaping its revenue mix. AI-related boards require significantly more layers than standard smartphone components, doubling AI chemistry revenue from 5% to 10% of total chemistry sales in 2025. Additionally, the company is benefiting from a memory crunch in the semiconductor industry. As fabs expand to meet DRAM and NAND demand for AI, MKS is seeing increased orders for its RF power solutions used in high-intensity vertical channel etching. MKS Inc. (MKSI) Reports $1.03B Q4 2025 Revenue Driven by Electronics & Packaging Segment Growth For 2026, MKS Inc. (NASDAQ:MKS) issued Q1 revenue guidance of $1.04 billion. While the company expects a seasonal dip in specialty industrial sales due to the Lunar New Year, it is preparing for a mid-year capacity boost with the opening of a new supercenter factory in Malaysia. MKS Inc. (NASDAQ:MKS) provides foundational technology solutions to semiconductor manufacturing, electronics & packaging, and specialty industrial applications internationally. It operates through the Vacuum, Photonics, and Material Solutions Division segments. While we acknowledge the potential of MKS as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Grocery Dive newsletter . Dive Brief: The Giant Company announced Thursday that it has agreed to acquire two family-owned supermarkets in Bedford County, Pennsylvania. Financial terms of the transactions were not disclosed. The Ahold Delhaize-owned grocer plans to temporarily close and update the stores, which are located in Everett and Saxton, Pennsylvania. The Giant Company’s decision to buy the stores continues a trend that has seen multiple independent grocers strike deals to sell their assets to larger retailers. Dive Insight: The Giant Company’s deal to acquire Everett Foodliner and Saxton Market from the Appleby family reflects shifts that are taking place across the grocery industry as escalating costs and competition make it increasingly difficult for smaller retailers to maintain their operations. “While it was a difficult decision to make, we are pleased by the care GIANT has shown for our business, employees, and customers,” Bob and Joe Appleby said in a statement. “We know our family business is in good hands with GIANT and we can’t wait to celebrate with them when the stores reopen later this year.” The deal includes the real estate that the supermarkets occupy as well as related grocery and fuel business assets. The Giant Company, which operates under the Giant and Martin’s brands, said employees at the two stores will “have the opportunity to interview for positions” with the company, without providing details. The Giant Company said it plans to reopen the stores later in 2026. “Expanding in existing markets is a key element of GIANT’S strategic growth plan,” said John Ruane, president of The Giant Company, in a statement. “We look forward to working closely with Bob and Joe on the transition, welcoming our new team members, and delivering value, freshness, and kindness to our new customers.” The Appleby family’s deal with The Giant Company follows agreements by other independent grocers to sell their stores to larger chains. For example, Minnesota-based Coborn’s agreed last April to buy two Kessler’s Food and Grocery stores from the family that owned them. Kessler’s said it opted to sell the stores because it concluded that it would be “increasingly difficult” for the company to remain competitive independently.

Best high-yield savings interest rates today, February 20, 2026 (up to 4% APY return) Find out if now is the right time to put your money in a savings account. Casey Bond · Lead Editor and Content Strategist, Banking Fri, February 20, 2026 at 5:00 AM CST 3 min read Find out if now is the right time to put your money in a savings account. In 2024, the Federal Reserve implemented a series of cuts to the federal funds rate and those rates continued on a downward trend throughout 2025. As a result, deposit interest rates have fallen from their historic highs. Still, it's possible to find high-yield savings accounts paying above 4% APY. So, if you’re looking for the best rates available today, here’s a breakdown of where to find them. What bank currently has the highest savings interest rate? Although savings interest rates are elevated by historical standards, the national average rate for savings accounts is still just 0.39%, according to the FDIC. The good news: Top high-yield savings accounts offer more than 10 times the national average. As of February 20, 2026, the highest savings account rate available from our partners is 4% APY. This rate is offered by SoFi*, Barclays, and Valley Direct. Here is a look at some of the best savings rates available today from our verified partners: Remember, it’s important to shop around before opening a savings account . Interest rates vary widely, but there are several banks (in particular, online banks ) and credit unions with highly competitive offers. Do online banks have the best savings account rates? Online banks operate exclusively via the web. This significantly reduces their overhead costs, so they’re able to pass those savings onto customers in the form of high deposit rates and low fees. In fact, many of the best high-yield savings accounts also come with zero monthly fees or minimum opening deposit requirements. If you’re searching for the best savings interest rates, online banks are a great place to start . That said, online banks aren’t the only place you can find savings accounts with rates that range between 4% and 5% APY. Credit unions are not-for-profit financial cooperatives and are also known for providing competitive rates and fewer fees. Many credit unions have certain requirements that must be met in order to become a member, though there are some that allow just about anyone to join. Should you open a savings account? Savings accounts are one of the safest places you can put your money. They’re insured by the FDIC (or the NCUA in the case of credit unions), which means your deposits are protected up to $250,000 if your financial institution fails. They also can’t lose money due to market fluctuations. However, a savings account isn’t always the right choice. Although today’s savings interest rates are high by historical standards, they still don’t offer the same returns you could achieve by investing your money in the market. For long-term savings goals such as retirement, you need to invest a bulk of your savings in higher risk (but higher reward) market investments such as stocks, index funds, and mutual funds to reach your target. But if you’re saving for a shorter-term goal such as a down payment on a home, vacation, or even an emergency fund , a high-yield savings account is one of the best options. That’s especially true if you want to access your money as needed; other types of high-yield deposit accounts, including money market accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) place more restrictions on how often you can make withdrawals. *Earn up to 4% Annual Percentage Yield (APY) on SoFi Savings with a 0.70% APY Boost (added to the 3.30% APY as of 11/12/25) for up to 6 months.

If you’re looking for a secure place to store your savings, a certificate of deposit (CD) may be a great choice. These accounts often provide higher interest rates than traditional checking and savings accounts. However, CD rates can vary widely. Learn more about CD rates today and where to find high-yield CDs with the best rates available. Banks with the best CD rates right now Today’s CD rates vary quite a bit. In general, however, CD rates have been declining for quite some time due to the Fed’s decision to cut its benchmark rate three times in the later part of 2024 and its additional three rate cuts in 2025. Even so, some banks are still offering competitive CD rates. For those that are, top rates reach about 4% APY. This is especially true for shorter terms of one year or less. Today, the highest CD rate is 4% APY. This rate is offered by Marcus by Goldman Sachs on its 1-year CD. Here is a look at some of the best CD rates available today from our verified partners: Compare these rates to the national average as of February 2026 (the most recent data available from the FDIC ): Compared with today’s top CD rates, national averages are much lower. This highlights the importance of shopping around for the best CD rates before opening an account . Why do online banks have the best CD rates? Online banks and neobanks are financial institutions that operate solely via the web. That means they have lower overhead costs than traditional brick and mortar banks. As a result, they’re able to pass those savings on to their customers in the form of higher interest rates on deposit accounts (including CDs) and lower fees. If you’re looking for the best CD rates available today, an online bank is a great place to start. However, online banks aren’t the only financial institutions offering competitive CD rates. It’s also worth checking with credit unions . As not-for-profit financial cooperatives, credit unions return their profits to customers, who are also member-owners. Although many credit unions have strict membership requirements that are limited to those who belong to certain associations or work or live in certain areas, there are also several credit unions that just about anyone can join. Should you open a CD? Whether or not you should put your money in a CD depends on your savings goals. CDs are considered a safe and stable savings vehicle — they don’t lose money (in most cases), are backed by federal insurance, and allow you to lock in today’s best rates. However, there are some drawbacks to consider. First, you must keep your money on deposit for the full term, otherwise you’ll be subject to an early withdrawal penalty. If you want flexible access to your funds, a high-yield savings account or money market account might be a better choice. Additionally, although today’s CD rates are high by historical standards, they don’t match the returns you could achieve by investing your money in the market. If you’re saving for a long-term goal such as retirement, a CD won’t provide the growth you need to reach your savings goal within a reasonable time frame.

Money market accounts can be a great option for short-term savings goals, like building an emergency fund or setting aside money for an upcoming expense. They generally offer higher interest rates than regular savings accounts, and they provide easier access to your money compared to some other options like certificates of deposit (CDs). Money market accounts are also considered low-risk, and they are FDIC-insured up to the standard $250,000 per depositor, per institution. This makes them safer than money market funds , which can be subject to market risk. However, keep in mind that many money market accounts require a minimum balance to open the account and earn the highest advertised rate. If you can’t maintain this balance, you might incur fees or miss out on the best rates. And although you can generally access your funds as needed, MMAs may limit the number of transactions you can make each month. If you need frequent access to your money, this might be a consideration. Read more: Is there a penalty for withdrawing from your money market account?

MGK vs. VOO David Dierking, The Motley Fool Fri, February 20, 2026 at 4:50 AM CST 4 min read ^GSPC VOO In general, large-cap stocks usually make an ideal cornerstone for a diversified portfolio. The question is: Should that core be comprised of large companies or really large companies? That's become a recurring problem for the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) . In the 1990s, the index was pretty balanced. In the lead-up to the dot-com bubble, the tech sector had grown to nearly 30% of the index. Financials were the biggest part of the index up until the real estate crisis took care of that. During the past decade, tech has taken over again, to the point where it now makes up about a third of the index. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks » Concentration at the top has created a vulnerability that makes investing in only the S&P 500 's biggest companies potentially dangerous. If the index has one sector comprising an outsized share of the index, the percentage may be even larger when targeting mega-caps. That's the problem we have today. The Vanguard S&P 500 (NYSEMKT: VOO) has become a standard part of many portfolios. Using the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: MGK) as an alternative requires special considerations. Image source: Getty Images. What you get with the S&P 500 vs. Mega Cap Growth ETFs With the S&P 500 ETF (exchange-traded fund), you get the entire U.S. large-cap market. During the past decade, it's become more of a large-cap growth index, given the dominance of tech stocks and the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Currently, 33% of the index is in technology, with financials (13%), communication services (11%), and consumer discretionary (10%) rounding out the top four sectors. The latter two sectors are also considered to have a growth tilt. Ideally, you would like to see the broader market have more meaningful exposure to most areas of the market. That's just not the case today, but the S&P 500 is still considered representative of the U.S. economy. The tech concentration is even more pronounced in the broader mega-cap growth category. Currently, that ETF consists of a 68% allocation to technology. Consumer discretionary (16%) is the only other sector with a double-digit percentage allocation. Investing in mega-cap growth isn't that far off from just investing in a pure tech ETF. Your mileage may vary when it comes to how much tech you want in your portfolio, but the allocation within the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF is high for almost any financial goal. Story Continues Which is the better buy? For long-term investing goals, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is almost certainly the better choice. It's a little heavy in tech and growth at the moment, but its diversification relative to the very tech-heavy mega-cap growth category is preferable for longer holding periods. For short-term investing goals, I still prefer the S&P 500. Tech has had an incredible run during the past decade. But valuations are high, peak AI optimism is already priced into the market, and growth rates are slowly beginning to come back down. The market is already moving away from tech for these reasons. That makes the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF the better choice. Should you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?

Free mortgage calculator Your mortgage rate plays a large role in how much your monthly payment will be. Use this mortgage calculator to see how your mortgage amount, rate, and term length will impact your monthly payments: You can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. How mortgage interest rates work A mortgage interest rate is a fee for borrowing money from your lender, expressed as a percentage. You can choose from two types of rates: fixed or adjustable. A fixed-rate mortgage locks in your rate for the entire life of your loan. For example, if you obtain a 30-year mortgage with a 6% interest rate, your rate will remain at 6% for the entire 30-year term unless you refinance or sell. An adjustable-rate mortgage locks in your rate for a predetermined period and then adjusts it periodically. Let’s say you get a 7/1 ARM with an introductory rate of 6%. Your rate would be 6% for the first seven years, then the rate would increase or decrease once per year for the last 23 years of your term. Whether your rate goes up or down depends on several factors, such as the economy and housing market. At the beginning of your mortgage term, most of your monthly payment goes toward interest. Your monthly payment toward mortgage principal and interest stays the same throughout the years — however, less and less of your payment goes toward interest, and more goes toward the mortgage principal or the amount you originally borrowed. Determine whether an adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage is better for you. Which mortgage term length should you get? A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is a good choice if you want a lower mortgage payment and the predictability that comes with having a fixed rate. Just know that your rate will be higher than if you choose a shorter term, and you will pay significantly more in interest over the years. You may want to consider a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage if you aim to pay off your home loan quickly and save money on interest. These shorter terms come with lower interest rates, and since you’re cutting your repayment time in half, you’ll save a lot in interest in the long run. But you’ll need to be sure you can comfortably afford the higher monthly payments that come with 15-year terms. Learn how to decide between a 15-year and 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. Typically, an adjustable-rate mortgage could be good if you plan to sell before the introductory rate period ends. Adjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, then your rate will change after a predetermined amount of time. However, 5/1 and 7/1 ARM rates have similar to (or even higher than) 30-year fixed rates recently. Before getting an ARM just for a lower rate, compare your rate options from term to term and lender to lender. Are mortgage rates decreasing? Mortgage rates have generally fallen since the end of last May, and home loan rates are now at their lowest level since September 2022, according to Freddie Mac.

HELOC and home equity loan rates today, February 20, 2026: Lowest rates since late 2022 Hal Bundrick, CFP® · Senior Writer Laura Grace Tarpley · Lead Editor and Content Strategist, Mortgages Fri, February 20, 2026 at 5:00 AM CST 4 min read National average rates for second mortgage home equity loans and lines of credit are nearing 7%, their lowest point since late 2022. Over the years, your home has grown in value. Now you can access that equity at very favorable interest rates. Find out how HELOC and home equity loan interest rates work and what you can expect to pay. HELOC and home equity loan rates: Friday, February 20, 2026 According to real estate analytics firm Curinos, the average HELOC rate is 7.23% . The national average rate on a home equity loan is 7.44% . Rates are based on applicants with a minimum credit score of 780 and a maximum combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) of less than 70%. With mortgage rates remaining in the low-6% range, homeowners are unlikely to let go of their lower primary mortgage anytime soon, so selling a house may not be an option. A cash-out refinance might not be workable either. Why give up your 5%, 4% — or even 3% mortgage ? Accessing some of that value with a use-it-as-you-need-it HELOC or lump-sum home equity loan can be an excellent alternative. MORE : Here are our picks for the best HELOC lenders. How lenders determine HELOC and HEL interest rates Home equity interest rates are calculated differently from mortgage rates. Second mortgage rates are based on an index rate plus a margin. That index is often the prime rate, which is 6.75%. If a lender added 0.75% as a margin, the HELOC would have a variable rate of 7.50%. A home equity loan may have a different margin, because it is a fixed-interest product. Lenders have flexibility with pricing on a second mortgage product, such as a HELOC or home equity loan . Your rate will depend on your credit score, the amount of debt you carry, and the amount of your credit line compared to the value of your home. Shop a few lenders to find your best interest rate offer. Learn about how fixed-rate HELOCs work. Look for low introductory HELOC rate offers Today, FourLeaf Credit Union is offering a HELOC APR (annual percentage rate) of 5.99% for 12 months on lines up to $500,000. That's an introductory rate that will convert to a variable rate in one year. When shopping for lenders, be aware of both rates. And as always, compare fees, repayment terms, and the minimum draw amount. The draw is the amount of money a lender requires you to initially take from your equity. The best home equity loan lenders may be easier to find, because the fixed rate you earn will last the length of the repayment period. That means just one rate to focus on. And you're getting a lump sum, so no draw minimums to consider. HELOC and home equity loan rates today: FAQs What is a good interest rate on a HELOC right now? Rates vary significantly from one lender to the next. You may see rates from 6% to as much as 18%. It really depends on your creditworthiness and how diligent you are as a shopper. Currently, the national average for a HELOC is 7.23%, and for a home equity loan it's 7.44%. Is it a good idea to get a HELOC or a home equity loan right now? Interest rates fell for most of 2025. They are expected to remain steady through the first half on 2026. So yes, it's a good time to get a second mortgage. And with a HELOC or a HEL, you can use the cash drawn from your equity for things like home improvements , repairs, and upgrades. Or just about anything else. What is the monthly payment on a $50,000 home equity line of credit? If you withdraw the full $50,000 from a line of credit on your home and pay a 7.50% interest rate, your monthly payment during the 10-year draw period would be about $313. That sounds good, but remember that the rate is usually variable, so it changes periodically, and your payments will increase during the 20-year repayment period. A HELOC essentially becomes a 30-year loan. HELOCs are best if you borrow and repay the balance within a much shorter period of time. Is now a good time to take out a HELOC? It can be a good time to get a HELOC, especially if you don’t want to lose the low rate on your first mortgage. Learn how the housing market could affect your decision. How to use a HELOC to pay off debt (and when it makes sense) If you’re burdened by loan payments, using a HELOC to pay off debt could save you big in interest. But it’s not for everyone.

REUTERS/David Ryder/File Photo Full caption By Allison Lampert and Mike Stone Fri, February 20, 2026 at 5:02 AM CST 3 min read By Allison Lampert and Mike Stone Feb 20 (Reuters) - New U.S. cybersecurity rules for the defense sector are leading some small suppliers to rethink military work due to high compliance costs, raising production risks at a time when the Trump administration ‌is pressuring contractors to boost output and diversify the supply base. More from Yahoo Scout What are the key CMMC cybersecurity requirements? How much do CMMC compliance costs impact suppliers? Why are small defense suppliers reconsidering military work? What risks does supplier exodus pose to defense production? The Defense Department's long-delayed U.S. Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification started last November ‌to protect sensitive information, known as controlled unclassified information. Companies working on federal contracts now perform cybersecurity self-assessments as the first of three CMMC levels, with the more stringent second level ​that includes audits expected to begin by November. Months-long waits for audits to ensure compliance and confusion over what information needs protection have made meeting the higher standards more difficult, the executives say. They spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. Without a clear definition, contractors are asking for greater compliance even if the supplier does not handle sensitive information such as technical drawings of a fighter jet fuel pump, an industry source ‌said. COSTS RAISE CONCERNS Additional costs of hundreds of thousands of dollars ⁠per small company are also deterring some suppliers with fragile finances, industry sources said. \"Some of these firms, particularly those that also compete in commercial markets, report that the accumulation of complex and costly regulatory requirements is forcing ⁠them to reconsider—if not exit—the defense marketplace altogether, further challenging the health and resilience of the industrial base,\" said Margaret Boatner, vice president of national security policy at the U.S.-based Aerospace Industries Association. Many of its member companies also serve the defense industry. Some 88% of aerospace firms are small businesses, according to data from ​a ​2022 U.S. House Small Business Subcommittee. Three aerospace companies, two in the United States and ​one in Canada, told Reuters they each have a ‌handful of suppliers who will not comply with the more stringent CMMC requirements, such as undergoing the audit. The president of one of the U.S. companies said half of its suppliers have not indicated whether they will comply. The head of another company, which is the sole source of a part for a U.S. fighter jet program, is also unsure what his suppliers will do. The Department of Defense declined to comment. SMALL SUPPLIERS CRITICAL TO SUPPLY CHAIN The health of small suppliers is closely watched by investors after years of production bottlenecks. Some are the only producers of key parts ‌needed by bigger contractors to assemble weapons and equipment. Story Continues Alex Major, a lawyer at McCarter & ​English who advises defense contractors on CMMC compliance, said the certification requirements could inadvertently ​reduce competition in the lower rungs of the defense supply chain. CMMC, ​introduced in 2019, was delayed by industry concerns and confusion that required years of discussion with the Pentagon. The challenge ‌is particularly acute for international suppliers who also comply with ​European data privacy laws and other ​regional cyber standards, Major said. \"You're telling these contractors to hold data a particular way or identify it as controlled information pursuant to the United States government, and (other) data privacy laws might differ,\" he said. An executive with the Canadian company said he will need to spend ​C$500,000 ($365,176.75) to comply with rules in Europe and ‌the U.S. Dave Trader, CEO of the nonprofit U.S. aerospace supplier Pathfinder Manufacturing, said he is unsure whether compliance is worth the ​cost since the firm does limited defense work making wire harnesses, and sees strong demand from planemaker Boeing.

Using a simple momentum indicator - the four-week rule - we can generally stay in step with the trend.

Subscribe today! We can use filters - volatility, seasonality, price distribution - to theoretically manage risk. I saw a discussion on the social media site LinkedIn recently with the poster stating he wanted a simple trading system, rather than one filled with all the equations and statistics that drive most algorithms these days. (It’s at this point I could veer off and discuss how unsophisticated – or stupid – the artificial intelligence behind the algorithm trade industry actually is based on how easily it can be manipulated by social media posts. We’ve seen over the past decade how this has become the game within the game, guessing what the next post – usually not quite true – will be. But that’s a bigger subject for another day.) This brings to mind the age-old debate of if the algorithm-driven investments side of the market is trend following or trend setting. Based on my application of Newton’s First Law of Motion applied to market analysis, a trending market will stay in that trend until acted upon by an outside force (from John J. Murphy’s “Technical Analysis of the Futures Markets”, 1986 edition, page 3), I’ll continue to hold to my belief algorithms are trend setters. This brings up another larger discussion of the value of technical analysis given algorithms do not use classic technical patterns. With that as background, let’s start building our simple trading system based on my 7 Market Rules, starting with #6: Fundamentals win in the end. In the past I’ve mentioned something I call the Vodka Vacuity, the reality there are no Absolut(e)s in market analysis. But there is one: Eventually, markets come down to supply and demand. No, I don’t mean government related estimates and imaginary numbers, but rather real fundamentals shown to us through spot (cash) price, basis (differential between spot/cash and futures), futures spreads, and forward curves. One of the filters used by investors moving gains from equities (Rule #7: Stock markets go up over time) to commodities is looking for markets with bullish real supply and demand. A couple examples over the past year or so are live cattle (LEJ26) and the ongoing rally in soybeans ($CNSI). Both could be viewed as Rubber Band Dispositions; the former with bullish fundamentals and bearish social media posts driving algorithm selling, the latter what could be considered bearish fundamentals and bullish social media posts triggering algorithm buying. When the Rubber Band snaps, markets return to their base, meaning supply and demand. Story Continues Given this, our goal is to follow investment funds that are presumably evaluating real market fundamentals, or as Rule #1 tells us: Don’t get crossways with the trend. Based on this rule we will stay in step with the flow of investment money into and out of markets. How do we know when the trend – price direction over time – changes? One way is to use the Four-Week Rule discussed in Murphy’s book (page 268). This was the first thing that came to mind when I saw the initial social media post for Murphy wrote, “The system based on the four-week rule is simplicity itself”. Here’s how to use it: 1) Cover short positions and buy long whenever the price exceeds the highs of the four preceding full calendar weeks. 2) Liquidate long positions and sell short whenever the price falls below the lows of the four preceding full calendar weeks. Taking a step back to look at the big picture and we see: a) This is a momentum-based rule without all the complicated math and b) it fits with what I call the Goldilocks Principle - Daily charts are too hot, monthly charts are too cold, but weekly charts are just right. Rule #2 tells us to let the market dictate our actions. Here is where our reads on real fundamentals come into play. If we use a variation of Peter Lynch’s advice and “trade what we know” (meaning we can buy long or sell short commodities) we can narrow our list of commodity sectors and/or markets to those we have a better feel for. As you might recall, in my case, it’s Grains, corn in particular. But others might be more comfortable with cattle (live or feeders), coffee, or heaven forbid natural gas (aka The Widow Maker). Once we’ve narrowed our scope, or in some cases even if we haven’t, we then evaluate the potential of a long or short position by using our reads on real supply and demand: short-term spot/cash price, basis, and nearby futures spread, long-term the market’s forward curve. Even if we our analyzing fundamentals and positioning ourselves accordingly based on market momentum, we still need to limit risk as best we can by using filters (Rule #3). By this I mean volatility (high versus low), seasonality (a contra-seasonal move indicates supply and demand are different than normal), and price distribution (how often does a market hit current price levels and how long does it tend to stay). By using these filters combined with our understanding of trend and market fundamentals we can decide if we want to position ourselves in futures, and if so which contract, options (keeping in mind those who make a living trading options play chess while the rest of us play checkers), ETFs, equities, or a derivative market of some sort.

The engineering company was selected for its expertise in designing and executing gold processing plants similar in scale to Ikkari, with a particular focus on operating in cold climates. The feasibility study is due to be completed by the end of the first half of 2027 (H1 2027). The project layout, which closely aligns with the pre-feasibility study (PFS), has been finalised. It includes all mining, processing and waste infrastructure within the project boundary, supporting a consistent development pathway. Recent optimisation studies have improved processing methods and waste management strategies, reduced environmental impact and strengthened the permitting strategy. An updated environmental impact assessment (EIA) is due to be submitted in the fourth quarter of 2026. Significant progress has been made, including metallurgical test work that indicates gold recoveries above 95% with lower cyanide consumption. The design for managing mine waste has been streamlined to include the use of stacked filtered tailings and managed waste rock facilities. Meanwhile, water management is a significant area of focus, with ongoing design studies for discharging treated water into the Kitinen River and plans to divert a small portion of the Saittajoki River. Discussions are ongoing with the state-owned utility, Fingrid Oyj, regarding grid connection, with route planning expected to be concluded by March 2026 following Despro Oy's appointment as design consultant last month. A total of 3,580m was drilled as part of geotechnical investigations related to open-pit and underground mine design in 2025. Long-term cost optimisation strategies are under consideration, including owner-operated versus contract mining models and grade sequencing to boost early cash flow from open-pit mining. Rupert Resources CEO Graham Crew said: \"We are pleased to announce that the Ikkari project has formally entered the feasibility phase. The appointment of Ausenco represents an important milestone in advancing the project towards development. \"Over the past year, the team has completed significant optimisation work across processing, waste and water management. \"The updated design remains closely aligned with the PFS, while further reducing both technical and environmental risk.\" \"Rupert Resources picks Ausenco for feasibility study at Ikkari project\" was originally created and published by Mining Technology , a GlobalData owned brand.

From groceries to rent payments, many of life’s basic living expenses are more expensive than they were just a few years ago, and many people don’t feel like their paychecks stretch as far as they used to. Must Read Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP Robert Kiyosaki says this 1 asset will surge 400% in a year — and he begs investors not to miss its ‘explosion’ In order to get by, Americans are increasingly turning to secondary sources of income. According to a MyPerfectResume survey of 1,000 U.S. workers, almost three-quarters (72%) of respondents with a regular job now depend on at least one secondary source of income, which is up 71% from 2025 (1). Where side hustles were once seen as a way to bring in a bit of extra cash for savings or discretionary spending, they’re now considered a lifeline for the 26% of respondents who say they need a secondary income just to cover basic living expenses. Why more Americans need a side hustle As MyPerfectResume reports, nearly four in 10 respondents (38%) say “inflation has significantly increased their need for additional income,” while 72% say the “rising costs have made side work more necessary overall.” Over the past five years, the cost of living has increased significantly while wages simply haven’t kept up. This comes during a time of economic uncertainty that’s coupled with the threat of artificial intelligence, which could upend the careers of many Americans in the future. Respondents to the survey say their second income is derived from freelance or gig work (14%), investments (14%), side businesses they own (9%), passive income such as rent or royalties (9%), or a second job with another employer (4%). While more than half (52%) say having additional income “makes them feel more secure” and 68% say their side work “has never interfered with ambition or availability at their main job,” working a side gig can take its toll. The downsides of side hustles While a side hustle can boost your income, it can also leave you with little to no downtime, and that could potentially do harm to your relationships. You could also end up neglecting your primary job because you find your side hustle to be more interesting (or you’re just plain tired). If your primary job pays well, you may be better off putting in extra hours there — in hopes of getting a promotion or a raise — as opposed to devoting energy to a lower-paying side hustle. Story Continues Besides, as time goes on, that fun side gig may start to feel more and more like a legitimate job. And even if it’s a side hustle, it still comes with all the same responsibilities as your primary job — perhaps even more so, since you’re also responsible for taxes, accounting, insurance and potential legal matters. If you’re depending on passive income or even investments to boost your income, you’ll probably discover that they’re not truly passive, as most require substantial upfront and ongoing work. Read More: The average net worth of Americans is a surprising $620,654. But it almost means nothing. Here’s the number that counts (and how to make it skyrocket) For instance, setting up a successful portfolio can take time and research, and at least occasional monitoring and rebalancing. Similarly, real estate can take substantial time and effort to acquire and generally requires ongoing maintenance and property management, which could include dealing with tenants (and that could be a lot of work). Respondents to the MyPerfectResume survey say that sustaining a side income has led to a decline in health (21%), less time for family hobbies (20%) and an increase in burnout (15%). Yet more than a quarter (28%) are adapting, and report that their workload now feels “very sustainable.” The upsides of a secondary income While the extra cash is a major plus, there are other benefits of a side hustle that aren’t monetary. For example, a side gig “can give you a competitive advantage in your career,” psychology expert and author Alice Boyes writes in Psychology Today, arguing that a side hustle can help you develop skills that others on your career trajectory may not possess (2). “This can help you become unique in your main career since you’ll bring those new skills and perspectives to your core work role.” A side hustle can also diversify “your sources of self esteem” and “make you more resilient to knock backs,” writes Boyes. So, if you’re struggling at your day job but your side hustle is bustling, “it can be easier to cope with your work-related frustrations, disappointments and setbacks.” A side gig might also allow you to use a different part of your brain or body (depending on the job), helping to prevent mental fatigue or physical injury. It could also provide you with an opportunity to hang out with new, interesting people, build your network and give you more balance and perspective (especially if you’re a workaholic). Regardless of the pros and cons of side hustles, the need for secondary income sources seems like it's here to stay. In fact, most respondents (71%) in the MyPerfectResume survey believe side incomes will become more common among U.S. workers next year (1). You May Also Like Turning 50 with $0 saved for retirement?

      "content": "Survey says 80% of Gen Xers and boomers regret not saving sooner. Here’s how to maximize your retirement savings now Vawn Himmelsbach Sat, February 21, 2026 at 6:00 AM CST 5 min read As we age, we accumulate memories — and usually a few regrets, too. For many people facing retirement, those regrets are related to financial decisions made years or even decades earlier. Must Read Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP Robert Kiyosaki says this 1 asset will surge 400% in a year — and he begs investors not to miss its ‘explosion’ More than 80% of Gen Xers (born 1965-1980) and boomers (born 1946-1964) regret not starting to save or participate in their employer-sponsored retirement plan earlier in their working lives, according to a 2025 survey by Nationwide Retirement Institute (1). Even those who did start saving early often wish they had taken a different approach. More than 80% wish they’d focused on protecting their savings from market volatility or converting assets into sustainable retirement income, according to the survey. (2) Many Gen Xers and younger boomers are in their peak earning years and final accumulation phase before retirement. But if they feel behind on their goals, they may be paralyzed by fear rather than taking advantage of the tools available to them. Still, starting late does not mean it’s hopeless. Get educated and get saving The Nationwide Retirement Institute survey found that 54% of Gen Xers and 39% of boomers don’t fully understand how compounding works and more than half believe their 401(k) will provide a stable monthly income similar to a paycheck. If you’re unclear on investing basics or how your 401(k) withdrawals will work in retirement, MyMoney.gov offers financial literacy resources, as do non-profits like the Khan Academy (3). There are also many personal finance books, blogs and podcasts. You could also talk to a reputable financial planner. Next, take stock of your current situation. American adults believe they’ll need $1.26 million to retire comfortably, according to a 2025 survey by Northwestern Mutual (4). Read More: The average net worth of Americans is a surprising $620,654. But it almost means nothing. Here’s the number that counts (and how to make it skyrocket) Yet 46% of Gen Xers surveyed and 56% of boomers believe they’re financially prepared for retirement. Meanwhile, 56% of Gen Xers and 40% of boomers say it’s at least somewhat likely they’ll outlive their savings. Those concerns are understandable. Gen Xers have an average 401(k) balance of $192,300 and an average IRA balance of $103,952, while boomers have an average 401(k) balance of $249,300 and an average IRA balance of $257,002, according to Fidelity Investments (5). Story Continues To build a realistic catch-up plan, you need a clear understanding of your current finances and how far away you are from your retirement goals. Catching up may feel impossible, but there’s still time even if you’re in your early 60s. After all, you may still have several years or even a decade of compounding to work in your favor. You might consider delaying retirement to give yourself more time to save and allow your investments to grow. Taking Social Security later can also increase your monthly benefit, which may reduce the amount you need to draw from savings. Money moves you can take now There are practical steps you can take today, such as maxing out your retirement accounts, particularly those with employer matching and making catch-up contributions. For 2026, the annual contribution limit for employees who participate in a 401(k), 403(b), governmental 457 plan or the federal government’s Thrift Savings Plan is $24,500. The annual limit for IRA contributions is $7,500 (5). If you’re 50 or older, you can make a catch-up contribution of $8,000, for a total of $32,500. If you’re 60 to 63, you can make an extra catch-up contribution of $11,250, for a total of $35,750. A new permanent rule also applies beginning in 2026. If you’re 50 or older and your Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxable earnings were $150,000 or more in the previous year, any catch-up contributions to your 401(k) must be made to a Roth 401(k). That means those contributions will be made with after-tax dollars rather than pre-tax dollars. However, withdrawals from a Roth 401(k) that meet the five-year rule are tax-free, unlike withdrawals from a traditional 401(k). Generic numbers from surveys can provide a useful starting point, but may not reflect your personal situation. The amount you’ll need to save depends on when you plan to retire, where you want to retire and how you want to live during those years. A qualified financial advisor can run projections based on where you are today and where you want to be. They can help you create a plan and position your portfolio for growth while accounting for your age, goals and risk tolerance. You May Also Like Turning 50 with $0 saved for retirement?

U.S. President Donald Trump said Iran had no more than 15 days to strike a deal over its nuclear program or “really bad things” would happen. The Wall Street Journal reported that President Trump is considering an initial limited strike on military or government sites in Iran to pressure it into meeting his demands for a nuclear deal. Market participants are also bracing for a potential Supreme Court ruling on President Trump’s sweeping tariffs. In yesterday’s trading session, Wall Street’s major indexes ended in the red.

Also, chip stocks slid, with Microchip Technology (MCHP) and Texas Instruments (TXN) dropping more than -2%. In addition, Booking Holdings (BKNG) slumped more than -6% and was the top percentage loser on the Nasdaq 100 after the company posted weaker-than-expected Q4 EPS. On the bullish side, Omnicom Group (OMC) jumped over +15% and was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500 after the marketing conglomerate reported better-than-expected Q4 revenue.

Also, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said that monetary policy is “in a good place.” Meanwhile, U.S. rate futures have priced in a 94.0% probability of no rate change and a 6.0% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut at the next central bank meeting in March.

In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.070%, down -0.17%. The Euro Stoxx 50 Index is up +0.47% this morning as stronger-than-expected PMI data from the region boosted sentiment. Luxury stocks outperformed on Friday, led by a more than +12% jump in Moncler Spa (MONC.M.DX) after the Italian high-end fashion brand reported better-than-expected Q4 revenue. Consumer staples stocks also jumped after brokerage Deutsche Bank upgraded the sector to Neutral from Cautious. The benchmark index is on track to notch its largest weekly gain since early January, as investors take comfort in a broadly improving corporate earnings outlook. A survey released on Friday showed that Eurozone business activity grew at a faster pace than expected in February, driven by a sharp rebound in manufacturing, which returned to growth for the first time since October. The PMI data indicated that the bloc’s economy continues to show resilience in the face of persistent headwinds. Separately, data showed that U.K. monthly retail sales rose much more than expected in January, fueled by strong demand for artworks and antiques. In addition, data showed that wage growth in the Eurozone cooled last year despite an unemployment rate hovering near record lows, signaling that inflation is likely to remain around the European Central Bank’s target this year. Meanwhile, ECB President Christine Lagarde told The Wall Street Journal she plans to complete her full term, dismissing earlier reports of a possible early departure.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Iran had no more than 15 days to strike a deal over its nuclear program or “really bad things” would happen. Financial stocks were among the biggest losers on Friday, mirroring a selloff in U.S. private‑equity shares after Blue Owl Capital restricted withdrawals from one of its funds. Automobile and technology stocks also slumped. The benchmark index posted a modest weekly decline, snapping a two-week winning streak. Data released on Friday showed that Japan’s annual core consumer inflation slowed to a two-year low in January, matching the Bank of Japan’s 2% target and giving the central bank more room to weigh its next move.

Though, this doesn't mean it has been a wildly successful addition to portfolios. If you'd invested $1,000 in Ford shares exactly five years ago, here's how much you'd have today. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks » Image source: Getty Images. Ford is a market underperformer Ford produced a total return of 63% in the past five years (as of Feb. 17). This means that a $1,000 investment would be worth $1,630 today. The gain lags the S&P 500 index, which put up a total return of 87%. Let's look at the positive and negative developments that have influenced this automotive stock over the past half-decade. The good Ford has maintained its leadership position atop the market for pickup trucks. Last year was the 44th straight year that the F-Series lineup was the best-selling vehicle in America. These vehicles have pricing power and support high margins for the company. Ford pro, the segment that sells cars, software, and services to commercial and government customers, was a notable bright spot. Its growth and profitability are generally better than that of the overall business. And it introduces a recurring revenue stream. Besides 2022, the business generated positive free cash flow each year over the past half-decade. That supports Ford's ongoing dividend, which currently yields 4.25%. Income investors might find this compelling. The bad On the other hand, there were many negative trends that Ford has had to deal with. Its electric vehicle (EV) segment, called model e, is one clear example. Billions upon billions of dollars in operating losses and weaker-than-expected demand finally forced the management team to shift its focus toward lower-priced EV models and hybrid vehicles. In December, Ford reported a monster $19.5 billion related charge. Quality issues continue to plague this company. Ford had 152 recalls last year. Warranty costs have also been elevated. Changing trade policies impacted the entire sector last year. Tariffs had a negative $2 billion impact on Ford in 2025. And they'll continue to pressure earnings this year. Investors shouldn't expect things to change It's not encouraging for investors to see that Ford shares don't have a history of beating the market. I believe this trend will continue over the next five years and beyond. That's because revenue and profit growth in the long run won't be anything to write home about. That's the nature of being a mass market car manufacturer. Story Continues The stock is cheap, but Ford isn't likely to register impressive returns.

If you’re trying to build wealth, your first six figures in savings is a huge milestone. That’s according to the late billionaire Charlie Munger. “It’s a b—-, but you gotta do it,” Munger told investors at an annual Berkshire Hathaway meeting two decades ago (1). Top Picks Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP Most Americans earn a dismal 0.39% APY on their cash at big banks. Unlock up to 4.05% APY and pay $0 in account fees instead with a Wealthfront Cash Account “I don’t care what you have to do,” he continued. “If it means walking everywhere and not eating anything that wasn’t purchased with a coupon, find a way to get your hands on $100,000. After that, you can ease off the gas a little bit.” Munger’s six-figure fixation might seem a bit arbitrary at first, but his reason behind it was actually simple: Six figures are where the real power of compounding is unlocked. Once you cross this critical threshold, your money earns more money at a meaningful scale. But not everybody agrees. Some financial advice gurus are saying there’s freedom to be had with numbers as low as $20,000. Financial YouTuber Nischa Shah explains that once you’ve saved just 20 grand, you can begin taking advantage of the power of compound interest in your investments. More importantly, you can stop being driven by fear — and not have to take the first job you’re offered or stay in a role you hate because you lack other options. “Compound interest is one of the most powerful forces in finance,” she said (2). “And once you hit 20K, you’ll see exactly what it means. Your money doesn’t just sit there anymore. It starts earning returns. And then those returns start earning their own returns.” In her words, “It’s like planting a tree that grows even more trees for you.” Either way, whether the magic number is five or six figures, it’s clear the experts agree on one thing: When it comes to investing in your financial future, compound interest is the best friend to your savings. Here’s why maximizing savings with compound interest unlocks your wealth potential — and what you can do to hit your goal and discover financial freedom. America’s savings crisis Munger’s $100,000 benchmark has math on its side. But in reality, most families struggle to set aside six figures as they battle stagnant wages and rapidly rising costs of living. Story Continues To put this in perspective, the national savings rate, or amount of disposable income left over after accounts are settled, was just 3.5% in November 2025, which is the latest month that data is available, as of February 2026 (3). What is more alarming is that 21% of Americans have no emergency savings at all, and 37% say they would struggle to cover an unexpected $400 bill, according to a 2024 survey of 1,192 Americans from Empower (4). In other words, many families don’t have a safety net. The dearth of savings is particularly acute for younger Americans. According to 2026 data from Empower, the median net worth of Americans in their 20s is just $6,600, and those numbers only climb to $23,093 for those in their 30s and $68,698 for those in their 40s (5). That’s much less than Munger’s benchmark. That’s why it’s important to remember that your personal finances could start changing at a much lower threshold. If you’re young or lack savings, just getting to $20,000 could really help shift your thinking. Benefiting from high-yield accounts A lack of cash available immediately can limit your flexibility. In this situation, your top priority has to be survival, which means you don’t have the opportunity to leave your job in pursuit of a better one, take time off to get educated or take on investments with significant risk. Simply put, you have little to no wriggle room, and that has real consequences on the way you think and process the world around you. According to a survey of Vanguard customers, people with no emergency fund spend nearly twice as much time thinking about money issues every week than those with at least $2,000 in in the bank (6). That’s why a high-yield account like the Wealthfront Cash Account can be a great place to grow your emergency fund, offering both competitive interest rates and easy access to your cash when you need it. A Wealthfront Cash Account currently offers a base variable APY of 3.30%, and new clients can get a 0.75% boost during their first three months on up to $150,000 for a total APY of 4.05% . That’s 10 times the national deposit rate, according to the FDIC’s January report. With no minimum balances or account fees, as well as 24/7 withdrawals and free domestic wire transfers, your funds remain accessible at all times. Plus, Wealthfront Cash Account balances of up to $8 million are insured by the FDIC through program banks. Read More: I’m almost 50 years old and don’t have retirement savings. Is it too late to catch up? Read More: Non-millionaires can now invest in this $1B private real estate fund starting at just $10 Sounder wallet, sounder mind Boosting your savings can certainly fatten your wallet, but they have profound implications for your mental health, too. The same Vanguard study also found that going from no savings to $2,000 in savings improved financial well-being by 21% (6). Indeed, those who progressed further and saved up three to six months of living expenses in an emergency fund saw another 13% bump in well-being. Put another way, it’s good for your health to have an emergency fund. But scraping together an emergency fund might not seem easy at first. American households spent roughly $78,535 per year in 2024, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (7). That means a $20,000 emergency fund should cover just over three months of living expenses for the typical family. Once you hit this benchmark, though, you won’t need to focus as much on surviving and can start focusing on growth and investments instead. You can also start to think about taking some time off work to invest in education or pursue a better-paying job. The question is, how do you get to that benchmark? It could be as easy as setting up a budget. A quick daily check-in of your accounts can show you exactly where your money is going — and find new ways you can save. Don’t get overwhelmed by budgeting However, if managing a budget feels overwhelming to you, apps like Rocket Money can simplify the process. Rocket Money can easily flag recurring subscriptions, upcoming bills and unusual charges by pulling in transactions from all your linked accounts. This can help you cut unnecessary costs, and then you can manually redirect savings straight into your retirement fund. No spreadsheets, no guesswork, no stress. Small habits like this can make a big difference over time. Rocket Money’s intuitive app offers a variety of free and premium tools. Free features include subscription tracking, bill reminders and budgeting basics, while premium features — like automated savings, net worth tracking, customizable dashboards and more — make it easier to stay on top of your retirement contributions and overall financial goals. Searching for other ways to save Once you’ve set up a budget, it’s also worth assessing how you’re spending money. As Munger suggested, you might consider cutting back where you can. For instance, you might find in your budget that you have monthly expenditures that should be reassessed and trimmed down. That doesn’t have to mean sinking to an untenable living standa",

Here's what you need to know Danielle Antosz Sat, February 21, 2026 at 6:45 AM CST 5 min read In August 2025, President Trump signed an executive order aimed at allowing 401(k) account holders to invest in private equity assets. This means that American workers may be able to invest in companies that are not publicly traded on the stock market, such as private real estate investments (1). Supporters of the change say it's a way to expand investment choices for everyday Americans and even the playing field (2), while other experts insist this shift poses a \"huge exposure to risk\" and question how plan holders will determine which assets to offer their account holders (3). Must Read Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP Robert Kiyosaki says this 1 asset will surge 400% in a year — and he begs investors not to miss its ‘explosion’ So, what does this executive order actually mean for everyday investors? Here is what you need to know and how to determine whether or not to invest in private equities. What this change actually means for 401(k) account holders Traditionally, most 401(k) plans have offered a menu of publicly traded mutual funds, including large-cap stock funds, bond funds, target-date funds and index funds. These investments trade daily on public exchanges. Prices are transparent, fees are clearly disclosed and workers can easily move money in and out of funds. Private equity works differently. Private equity firms raise money to invest in companies that are not listed on public stock exchanges. That might mean buying and restructuring a private business, investing in a startup before it goes public, or acquiring mature companies. These funds typically lock up investors' money for years — sometimes a decade or more — before returning profits, if any materialize. Supporters argue that much of today’s economic growth is happening in private markets, not public ones. They say fewer companies are publicly traded today, which limits exposure for everyday investors (4). Some money managers, including BlackRock, estimate that adding private assets could increase long-term returns by about 0.50% per year, potentially resulting in roughly 15% more savings over a 40-year career (3). But critics say those numbers don’t tell the whole story. Private equity funds are complex. Evaluating them requires “significant expertise in the asset class as well as resources for due diligence in the manager selection process,” according to Wharton professor Bilge Yilmaz (5). Most individual savers don’t have those tools, and many plan committees may not either. Story continues Read More: The average net worth of Americans is a surprising $620,654. But it almost means nothing. Here’s the number that counts (and how to make it skyrocket) There's also a legal aspect to consider. Under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), companies that oversee 401(k) plans must act as fiduciaries. That means they are legally required to act in workers’ best interests and can be sued if they fail to do so (6). Attorney Jerome “Jerry” Schlichter, who has won more than $750 million in settlements tied to excessive 401(k) fees and investment choices, says he is watching how corporate executives decide whether or not to offer private equity in their 401(k) plans. “Buyer beware … Each and every firm is going to have to validate and authenticate the risk that is being implied when they add private markets,” Schlichter said in an interview with WealthManagement.com . “You better be prepared for defending that choice” (3). Understanding the risks of investing in private equity Private equity allows investors to invest in funds that buy, restructure, or grow private businesses. While that can sound appealing, especially when framed as access to the same types of investments wealthy institutions use, these assets come with real trade-offs. Here’s what retirement savers should keep in mind: Higher fees: Private equity funds often charge much more than traditional index funds. Those extra costs can eat into returns over time, especially in long-term retirement accounts. Limited liquidity: Unlike stocks or mutual funds that can be sold daily, private equity investments may lock up money for years, sometimes a decade or longer. That can create complications if you change jobs, need to rebalance your portfolio, or approach retirement. Less transparency: Public companies must regularly disclose financial information. Private companies face fewer reporting requirements, which can make it harder for investors to understand their risk. Performance isn’t guaranteed: While some private funds have delivered strong returns, experts caution that success often depends on access to financial managers, something everyday 401(k) participants may not have (2). The reality is, more choices don’t automatically mean better outcomes. If private equity becomes an option in your 401(k), make sure you understand the fees, the risks and how long your money could be tied up before deciding whether it belongs in your retirement plan.

Cuppage explained that VivoPower has secured approximately $30 million in private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing, bringing in strategic investors including Blue Sky Capital out of New York. He noted that the financing was completed at a higher share price than the company is currently trading at, which he said demonstrates investor conviction in VivoPower’s long-term value. The company is now undergoing a major strategic transition. Cuppage said VivoPower has spun off its digital treasury operations with no losses and is exiting its electric vehicle business by March. Going forward, the company will focus entirely on becoming a vertically integrated investor and developer of AI data centers. Proactive : Welcome back inside our Proactive newsroom. Joining me now is Alex Cuppage, Chief Investment Officer for VivoPower International PLC. Alex, good to see you. How are you? Alex Cuppage : Great to see you. Thanks so much for taking the time. The company recently secured about $30 million in financing through a PIPE. Can you explain what this vehicle is? We’re super excited to bring in strategic investors, including Blue Sky Capital out of New York. The PIPE is structured as a private transaction into a public company. It’s straightforward equity with nothing overly structured. It was completed at a higher share price than where we’re currently trading, which shows conviction from investors in the long-term value of Vivo. Having a New York firm involved must be strong validation. We feel incredibly fortunate. The investors are at the upper echelons of technology and sovereign society. We see them as strategic partners in what we’re building at Vivo. How will this capital be used, and where is the company headed? Historically, Vivo has been in electric vehicles and digital treasury. We’re now transitioning fully to AI infrastructure. We’ve spun off the digital treasury with no losses and are exiting the electric vehicle business next month. Our focus is becoming a vertically integrated investor and developer of AI data centers. We acquire land, secure permits and power agreements, design and construct data centers, and lease them to hyperscalers. We believe that AI data centers are the oil fields of the future. We want to own these cash flows in perpetuity through a permanent capital vehicle. We’re taking a 100-year view and believe AI infrastructure is still in its infancy. Story Continues There’s clearly significant global demand for AI data centers. Absolutely. When we compared global capacity to the US, Europe had 78% less data center storage capacity, the GCC had 98% less, and Southeast Asia and LatAm show similar gaps. AI will touch every industry and government vertical, requiring significantly more power. We’re focused on the Nordics, the GCC, and Korea, which we see as a leader in physical AI, robotics and automated manufacturing.

More from Yahoo Scout Why are airlines focusing more on premium customers? What broader economic trends drive airline industry premiumization? How are airlines using credit cards to boost revenue? What changes is United making to its rewards program? But it's going about it in a counterintuitive way, with both the carrot and the stick. Rather than focusing on just adding perks for loyalty members and credit card holders, the overhaul also includes denying non-holders certain ways of accruing miles and saving money. It's a new type of gatekeeping as other premium travel credit cards up their steep annual fees . Call it addition by subtraction. Or a company making full membership in its club more valuable by creating exclusions, which are sure to rankle at least some portion of an already air travel-stressed public. Companies reserving special perks for their highest-paying customers isn't new. Think of Costco's Executive Membership giving those honored guests an extra hour to shop their warehouses before the Gold Star common folk can enter. But United's shift is notable because it's holding out some previously universal privileges exclusively for cardholders, like frequent flier miles. MileagePlus members who don't have a United card will earn fewer miles for United flights than members who have one, United said in an announcement earlier this week . Other perks for cardholders include a 10% discount on every United award flight booked. Meanwhile, non-cardholders will no longer be able to earn any miles when they book basic economy, which loses even more status. All this underscores the airline industry's focus on bolstering credit card relationships with its flyers. Getting into the credit card relationship with cardholders — and the potential upsells — is big business. Premium customers are where the money is. Last month, Delta reported that the money it generated from premium seats would outpace revenue from the economy cabin, making explicit the industry's pivot to luxury and luxury-adjacent. United's program overhaul comes as the entire sector is pushing loyalty program memberships. Redeemable miles, upgrades, airport lounge benefits, and other perks are helping drive more customers to buy flights using airlines' co-branded credit cards, a substantial revenue stream for an industry that has struggled to profit from the actual business of selling affordable airfare. American Express and Chase both recently revamped their high-end travel credit cards, showering their customers with a stream of goodies while upping the cards' annual fees, which are approaching $1,000. Story continues A United Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner departs Los Angeles International Airport en route to New York on January 27, 2026, in Los Angeles, California. (Kevin Carter/Getty Images) · Kevin Carter via Getty Images The airline industry's turn toward premiumization reflects broader economic trends and highlights the bifurcation of consumer habits defined by wealth (and the lack of it). Even value-based retailers like Dollar Tree and Walmart are chasing more affluent consumers. In an economy where spending is concentrated among the highest earners, everyone is scrambling to win their business. And keep it.

But for many parents of adult children, financial support is now stretching well into their child’s middle age. According to 2025 data from Savings.com, half of parents with adult children provide at least some financial support, a three-year high. Parents of adult children ages 18-28 give an average of $1,813 monthly, while parents of those 29-44 provide $863 monthly. This help often includes covering recurring expenses like phone bills, car insurance, health insurance, or even student loan payments (1).

As a result, parental financial support is becoming the norm, even for adult children with full-time jobs. While parents want to help their kids stay afloat in a tougher economy, financial advisors warn that ongoing support can create long-term risks for both generations. Here’s what you can do if you’re caught between wanting to help your adult children financially, and worrying about setting aside enough for your own retirement. The consequences of financially supporting adult children Helping adult children isn’t inherently a bad thing, and for many families it feels necessary. The concern, experts say, is how the help is structured and how long it lasts. Some parents may be undermining their own retirement security without even realizing it. Dipping into savings or delaying retirement so your children don’t have to take on debt can backfire, says Kayla Walter, a certified financial planner at Bailey Wealth Advisors in Maryland. She points out that there are loans for education, but not for retirement. “You’re blowing through your savings at a much faster rate, and it’s not going to last you as long as maybe you intend to live,” she says (2). Another issue is that ongoing, open-ended support can unintentionally stall a child’s financial independence. Covering monthly bills like insurance, rent or utilities may ease short-term pressure, but it can also delay kids from making difficult budget decisions on their own. Story Continues A recent MarketWatch story highlighted a 27-year-old financial advisor whose mother currently covers her $191 monthly car-insurance bill after she purchased a new car. While both sides are currently satisfied with the situation, there’s no clear end date (3). Over time, that type of open-ended support can lead to resentment and long-term financial challenges for both generations. Read More: The average net worth of Americans is a surprising $620,654. But it almost means nothing. Here’s the number that counts (and how to make it skyrocket) Helping your kids reach financial independence Helping adult children financially isn't just a financial decision — it's also an emotional one, and that can make it tricky to navigate. The key, experts say, is to be intentional about the support you offer and to find ways to help them stand on their own. Here's how to get started: Make sure your own retirement is on track Before giving money, make sure your own finances are in order. Make sure retirement contributions are maxed (or on track), high-interest debt is managed and you have a six-month emergency fund. You won't be able to help your kids at all if you end up in a bad financial spot. Have an open conversation Talk openly about your own finances, what you can afford, and even past mistakes you have made. These conversations will help them understand boundaries you set later, and may encourage them to take a deeper look at their own finances. Set boundaries Review your own finances and decide what you can and can't offer. Maybe you're able to cover one-time costs like security deposits or a car repair, but can't commit to monthly bills indefinitely. Whatever your limits are, be clear and direct about the support you're comfortable offering. Consider larger, one-time gifts vs ongoing support A lump-sum gift or a family loan with written terms can be easier to manage than recurring expenses. Some advisors suggest using the annual gift-tax exclusion, $19,000 per recipient in 2026, as a natural boundary (4). This strategy can allow you to support your children without taking on monthly bills for an undetermined amount of time. Scale back slowly If you need to reduce support, taper it. For example, if you currently cover $500 in bills a month, cut back to $400 for a few months, then $200, and work your way down to $0. This gives your children time to adjust and may help ease any feelings of guilt. Pair help with financial education Covering bills can provide short-term relief, but it doesn’t always move adult children closer to long-term independence. Look for ways to pair financial support with skill-building. That might mean reviewing a budget together, talking through financial goals, reading a money book and discussing it or sharing a trusted podcast or resource. You likely won't be able to help forever, so the goal should be to help your kids build healthy financial habits (4). Today’s financial landscape looks very different from what many parents faced 20 or 30 years ago, and offering financial support into adulthood can help level the playing field. Still, support works best when it’s intentional. Making sure your own finances are secure and that your help encourages independence rather than reliance.

      "content": "One man used his Costco membership to save over $11K on a new car. How shoppers are finding alternatives to high prices Will Kenton Sat, February 21, 2026 at 6:15 AM CST 7 min read COST Vincent Rives was in the market for a new car, but the process felt overwhelming. Car dealerships are notorious for hard-sell techniques and upselling the customer on everything from tires to floor mats. He was shopping for groceries at Costco when a flyer for the Costco Auto Program caught his eye. Could the great savings and customer experience you expect from Costco be transferred to buying a car? (1). Must Read Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP Robert Kiyosaki says this 1 asset will surge 400% in a year — and he begs investors not to miss its ‘explosion’ Costco promised a fixed price and no haggling, which could turn a stomach-churning six hour ordeal into an easy one hour experience. It wasn’t just the process that was easier either. Rives ended up going with the 2025 RAV4 hybrid that was listed at $48,540, but because he bought through the Costco Auto Program, it only cost him $36,720 — a savings of over $11,000. His approach frames a larger trend in the automotive world: as prices and monthly payments remain near historic highs, buyers are increasingly willing to explore nontraditional paths to avoid haggling and unexpected costs. Here’s how buying a car at Costco works, and what consumers are doing to find the best deals. How does Costco get good car deals for its members? You can’t walk into your local Costco looking for cars on the top shelf. Though the retailer is famous for purchases in bulk, it doesn’t actually sell cars. Instead, the program is a way for Costco to offer value to both its members and car dealerships by cutting out uncertainty for both parties. This is how it works. Costco members are serious about shopping and saving money. When you pay your $65 annually for a Gold Star Membership ($130 per year for an Executive Membership), you show you’re committed to making Costco your go-to destination for great deals (2). Costco members are famously loyal, and the company knows your shopping profile. That’s valuable information for a retailer who has to spend large sums to attract the attention of someone like you. Armed with this information, Costco goes to local car dealers and offers to be a broker between a high-intent customer (you) on the condition that the deal shaves off some of their profit margin on the vehicle (3). Dealers accept slimmer margins because programs like Costco’s can deliver sales volume while cutting what it costs to find a buyer. With dealerships often spending roughly $400 to $800 per vehicle sold on advertising, a membership referral pipeline can function like a built-in lead source that offsets those marketing costs (4). Story Continues Rising costs and the pressure on monthly budgets Data from Kelley Blue Book showed that the average new-vehicle transaction price reached $50,326 in December 2025, which explains why middle-income shoppers feel priced out of the market or are afraid they will be forced to make significant compromises when they’re under the glare of a high-pressure sales person (5). Even when a buyer can technically afford the sticker price of a vehicle, the reality of financing is stretching household budgets to the limit. Reports from Experian indicate that average monthly payments for new cars have hovered around $748, while used car payments averaged $532 as of the third quarter of 2025 (6). For Costco Executive members, who get up to 2% cash back on purchases, the rebate on buying a $45,000 vehicle is another potential source of value. But beyond the raw numbers, many shoppers are desperate to avoid markups and surprise add-ons. Negotiating is a major pain point for most buyers, and dealerships often generate their highest margins through trade-in valuations, financing markups and back-end products like extended warranties or protection packages. For buyers like Rives, not having to worry about negotiating add-ons is worth it. Read More: The average net worth of Americans is a surprising $620,654. But it almost means nothing. Here’s the number that counts (and how to make it skyrocket) Exploring alternatives to find the best possible deal On the other hand, skilled negotiators may be able to get a better price than the Costco deal, especially if they are financing the car. For example, if you are pre-approved for a loan, you can ask the dealer to match or beat that rate. Many dealers have access to automaker incentive program, which allow them to beat a bank’s rate, sometimes with as low as 0% financing (7). While Costco’s club model is popular, it is only one option among several. AAA offers its own auto buying program that promises upfront pricing through a network of certified dealers. Sam’s Club provides a similar service powered by TrueCar, which often includes post-sale benefits for members (8, 9). Additionally, many credit unions, such as PenFed, pair their financing options with car-buying portals to give members a streamlined experience. These programs all share a similar goal of reducing negotiation fatigue through upfront offers (10). These programs all work in slightly different ways. Sam’s Club, for example, is more of an online marketplace than a club deal like Costco’s. Nevertheless, buyers still have to do their homework with regards to dealer fees, additional products, and financing terms. These services reduce the hassle of the initial price search, but they do not replace the need for due diligence, especially since actual savings may vary. Practical steps for securing the best overall value To get the best result, shoppers should treat membership pricing as just one quote in a broader process. Before visiting a dealer, it’s a good idea to secure preapproved financing from an independent bank or credit union. Buyers should also request written all-in quotes that include all taxes and fees from at least two different dealerships to ensure the membership price is truly competitive before you visit the showroom floor. It is also helpful to compare a membership offer from Costco, for example, against other portals like those offered by AAA or Sam’s Club. Throughout the process, the focus should remain on the total cost over the life of the loan rather than just the monthly payment, as longer loan terms can often hide high interest costs. Membership-based car buying programs are useful tools for avoiding stress and occasionally securing significant savings, but they work best when paired with traditional research. The primary takeaway is not simply to join a club to buy a car, but to use every credible pricing channel available and verify the math before signing any contract.

      "content": "RGTI or QBTS: Top Analyst Selects the Top Quantum Computing Stock to Buy TipRanks Sat, February 21, 2026 at 7:00 AM CST 8 min read QBTS RGTI Quantum computing may sound like science fiction, but it’s here today, and it represents the shiny new thing in high performance computing. Where classical computers make use of binary bytes to store data, quantum computers use the inherent superposition of subatomic states to create q-bits, bytes that are simultaneously on and off, 1 or 0. The result: a computing system that is naturally faster and higher performing. President's Day Sale - 70% Off Unlock hedge fund-level data and powerful investing tools for smarter, sharper decisions Stay ahead of the market with the latest news and analysis and maximize your portfolio's potential That additional capability, however, comes with meaningful trade-offs. Quantum hardware is significantly more complex and costly to manufacture than conventional semiconductor chips. Many systems must also operate at extremely low temperatures, requiring specialized cryogenic infrastructure that adds to overall expense and operational complexity. Despite these hurdles, interest in the technology continues to build. Quantum computing is being explored for applications in artificial intelligence , optimization, materials science, and cloud-based services. According to Precedence Research, the global quantum computing market reached $1.44 billion last year and is projected to expand to $19.44 billion by 2035, implying an approximate 30% compound annual growth rate. North America accounted for roughly 61% of the market. TD Cowen analyst Krish Sankar, ranked by TipRanks among the top 1% of Wall Street analysts, has been closely tracking developments in the sector. After examining two of the leading public players, Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ:RGTI) and D-Wave (NYSE:QBTS), the analyst has identified one as his preferred quantum computing stock at this stage of the industry’s development. Let’s take a closer look. Rigetti Computing We’ll start in Berkeley, California, where Rigetti Computing has been bringing quantum computers from the drawing board to the real world since 2013. The company has its hands in all the main aspects of quantum computing systems, and designs, builds, and markets superconducting quantum integrated circuits and processor chips as well as the supercooled dilution systems which those products need to reach a functional quantum state. Rigetti currently has several commercially available quantum computers, and prides itself on offering flexibility to draw in customers. The company’s flagship system is Ankaa-3, which uses a non-modular chip, and it also offers a smaller quantum computer, Novera, a 9-qubit QPU, designed to operate as a stand-alone unit or linked in tandem. Novera allows customers to set up a boosted quantum computer that can be expanded as needs grow and that provides more power than a single small unit. Story Continues The latest system from Rigetti, the modular Cepheus-1-108Q, is slated for commercial release by the end of 1Q26. The Cepheus system is based on twelve of the company’s 9-qubit chiplets, and was created to leverage Rigetti’s modular architecture to maximum advantage. Last month, Rigetti announced receipt of a new order from India to deliver a 108-qubit quantum computer to that country’s Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC). This is the premier R&D organization within the Indian government’s electronics and information tech ministry, and is scheduled to be installed on-site in Bengaluru during the second half of this year. The order is worth $8.4 million. We should note that Rigetti’s stock has been falling in recent months. The company faces headwinds, including high-level competition from major names such as IBM and Honeywell; lower-than-expected revenues combined with operating losses; and delays to the 108-qubit Cepheus system. This was visible in the last reported quarter, 3Q25. In that period, the company’s $1.9 million top line was down 19% from the prior year and missed the forecast by ~$223,000. At the bottom line, the operating loss for the quarter came to $20.5 million. The non-GAAP net loss of $10.7 million translated to a net loss per share of 3 cents. Top analyst Sankar takes a measured view of the company’s prospects. The 5-star analyst writes, “We see balanced risk/reward given premium valuation while it has lagged peers in revenue growth and scaling/fidelity rate metrics. Key risks to the story include cash burn and the possible need to raise capital in 1-2 years, a highly competitive market vs large tech companies (e.g., IBM, Google, Honeywell) and other quantum modalities such as ion traps, neutral atom, and photonics, and the scalability and fidelity rates of its own processor roadmap.” Accordingly, Sankar puts a Hold rating on Rigetti’s stock, but has no fixed price target in mind. (To watch Sankar’s track record, click here ) Overall, this quantum computer company gets a Moderate Buy rating from the Street’s consensus, based on 7 reviews that include 5 Buys and 2 Holds. The stock is priced at $16.6, and its $38.75 average price target implies a robust 133% upside for the coming year. (See Rigetti stock forecast ) D-Wave Quantum D-Wave, the second company we’re looking at here, is based in Palo Alto, California, where it’s been in the business of developing next-generation computing technology since 1999. The company bills itself as a ‘full-stack’ quantum computing firm, and boasts that it is able to deliver both the quantum computer hardware and the specialized software that runs on the new technology. D-Wave can deliver end-to-end quantum computing build-out solutions for a wide range of applications in science and business – and equally importantly, the company can also deliver the app development tools and the professional support services necessary to wring the highest performance from new quantum computing installations. This company is taking a unique approach to quantum computing, based on dual platforms: D-Wave is using both annealing and gate-model quantum systems to address the complex needs of modern computation. Quantum annealing is a path designed for optimized computing; the gate-model approach is designed to operate quantum logic on superconducting circuits. D-Wave is combining both approaches to wring the highest possible advantage from quantum computing. As the company puts it, annealing and gate-model quantum computing systems excel at finding different types of solutions – annealing quantum computing systems are better at materials simulations and some AI applications, while gate-model systems bring advantages in the fields of chemistry, molecular design, and energy storage. All of that’s good – but new quantum computing systems are only useful if customers can use them. D-Wave has addressed this by putting Leap, a real-time quantum cloud service, into operation. Its target audience is business customers, who can directly benefit from bringing quantum computer capabilities to their workloads. D-Wave launched Leap in 2018, and through it, customers can access some of the world’s most advanced and fastest quantum computers. In January, D-Wave made two announcements that highlight the company’s strengths. One, with Florida Atlantic University, details the school’s $20 million agreement to purchase an Advantage2 annealing quantum computer, to be installed at the school’s Boca Raton campus. The second announcement covers a $10 million enterprise Quantum Computing as a Service (QCaaS) deal with a leading Fortune 100 company. We should note that these announcements came after the company’s 3Q25 financial release, in which D-Wave showed a 100% year-over-year gain in revenue – with the top line hitting just over $3.7 million and coming in $711K better than had been expected. D-Wave did run a net loss in the quarter and reported a non-GAAP EPS of ($0.05), based on a quarterly adjusted net loss o",

How to invest like the Oracle when others want out Moneywise Sat, February 21, 2026 at 5:47 AM CST 10 min read BRK.A Mario Tama / Getty Images Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below. Short-term turbulence in the stock market can be enough to make novice investors nauseous, but veterans like Warren Buffett say it’s all part of the game. In May 2025, one of his last Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meetings before retirement, the 95-year-old commented on the roller coaster effect President Donald Trump's “reciprocal” tariffs had on the market. Top Picks Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP Most Americans earn a dismal 0.39% APY on their cash at big banks. Unlock up to 4.05% APY and pay $0 in account fees instead with a Wealthfront Cash Account “What's happened in the last 30, 45 days, 100 days, whatever you want to call it, it's really nothing,” he said (1). His confidence appears to align with predictions from other financial gurus for 2026. In spite of fear of an AI bubble (2) and dips in the price of gold (3), most investment firms on Wall Street were bullish in their predictions for the market this year, with many analysts looking forward to another year of double-digit returns (4). In fact, the billionaire has seen much worse volatility in the past. Here’s why the world’s most famous investor is unconcerned by swings in the stock market, and why you should avoid trying to time the market when valuations get rocky. Berkshire has lost 50% of its value before For Buffett, the market performance in 2025 was just a bump in the road to long-term gains. After all, the Oracle has been actively investing in stocks since 1941, when he was 11 years old, giving him much more historical context than the average investor. Now, after over eight decades of picking stocks amid these swings, nothing fazes him. Buffett insists young investors with limited experience should have a similar attitude. “If it makes a difference to you whether your stocks are down 15% or not, you need to get a somewhat different investment philosophy,” he recommended in his annual shareholder update (5). If you fall into that camp of investors who worry about upcoming market swings, here’s how you can prepare to weather the storm as Buffett does. Read More: I’m almost 50 years old and don’t have retirement savings. Is it too late to catch up? Read More: Non-millionaires can now invest in this $1B private real estate fund starting at just $10 Shock-proofing your portfolio First and foremost, remember that market crashes and volatility are inevitable. That’s why sophisticated investors like Buffett structure their portfolios to sail through turbulence. Story Continues For instance, Berkshire’s assets tend to be well-diversified. According to their latest 13-F filing, they had 47 holdings in their publicly traded portfolio, with the largest positions by far being Apple at 18.7% and American Express Co at 16.1%. Berkshire is also sitting on a cash pile of $381.7 billion, which could signal that the legendary firm is poised to snap up stocks at low cost in the event of a market crash. To diversify your investments, you might add different asset classes to your portfolio. If, like Berkshire, your portfolio is fairly well-diversified, you may want to start hedging with alternative assets. After all, targeting investments that aren’t as heavily impacted by stock market shifts can give your portfolio some protection during market downturns. Invest in precious metals One option is investing in precious metals like gold and silver, which can sometimes be used to take the edge off inflation. While gold’s record performance in 2025 has been somewhat tarnished by a recent slump, many analysts still foresee the yellow metal surpassing $5,400 per ounce by the last quarter of 2026 (6). As a portfolio diversifier, gold still holds its place. But if you want to tap into this asset class, you’re going to need a guide. That’s where services like Priority Gold , an industry leader in precious metals, come into play. Priority Gold offers the physical delivery of gold and silver — plus, they have an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau and a 5-star rating from Trust Link. If you’d like to convert an existing IRA into a gold IRA, Priority Gold offers 100% free rollover, as well as free shipping and free storage for up to five years. Qualifying purchases can also receive up to $10,000 in free silver . To learn more about how Priority Gold can help you reduce inflation’s impact on your nest egg, you can download their free 2025 gold investor bundle . Consider real estate If you’re looking to go beyond gold, you could also try looking at investing in real estate. Commercial real estate specifically can offer higher potential returns than residential real estate, thanks to longer lease terms, higher rental rates and the potential for greater appreciation. But direct access to the $22.5 trillion commercial real estate sector has been limited to a select group of elite investors — until now. One way to invest in real estate is by purchasing rental properties and becoming a landlord. But for the average American who wants to avoid the need for a hefty down payment or the burden of property management, crowdfunding platforms like Arrived make it easier to slice yourself up a piece of that pie. Backed by world class investors like Jeff Bezos, Arrived allows you to invest in shares of rental homes with as little as $100 , all without the hassle of mowing lawns, fixing leaky faucets or handling difficult tenants. The process is simple: Browse a curated selection of homes that have been vetted for their appreciation and income potential. Once you find a property you like, select the number of shares you’d like to purchase, and then sit back as you start receiving any positive rental income distributions from your investment. For a limited time, when you open an account and add $1,000 or more, Arrived will credit your account with a 1% match Another way to boost your income through investment in rental properties is to consider the potentially steadier returns from multifamily units. While buildings like this used to require a large upfront investment, now you can get access for less. If diversifying into multifamily rentals appeals to you, you could consider investing with Lightstone DIRECT , a new investing platform from the Lightstone Group, one of the largest private real estate companies in the country with over 25,000 multifamily units in its portfolio. Since they eliminate intermediaries — brokers and crowdfunding middlemen — accredited investors with a minimum investment of $100,000 can gain direct access to institutional-quality multifamily opportunities. This streamlined model can help reduce fees while enhancing transparency and control. And with Lightstone DIRECT, you invest in single-asset multifamily deals alongside Lightstone — a true partner — as Lightstone puts at least 20% of its own capital into every offering. All of Lightstone’s investment opportunities undergo a rigorous, multi-stage review before being approved by Lightstone’s Principals, including Founder David Lichtenstein. How it works is simple: Just sign up with your email, and you can schedule a call with a capital formation expert to assess your investment opportunities. From here, all you have to do is verify your details to begin investing. Founded in 1986, Lightstone has a proven track record of delivering strong risk-adjusted returns across market cycles with a 27.6% historical net IRR and 2.54x historical net equity multiple on realized investments since 2004.

      "content": "Why Your Zip Code May Matter More Than Your Salary John Csiszar Sat, February 21, 2026 at 9:05 AM EST 4 min read When it comes to financial well-being, your income is only part of the story. Government data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the U.S. Treasury Department, among others, shows that the ZIP code where you live can influence your financial success as much as, or even more than, your salary. That’s because what matters most for financial security is not income itself, but the amount of money you have left after covering expenses. Here’s a look at how housing costs, taxes, insurance and the local cost of living can outweigh income differences, making location a powerful driver of financial success. Housing Costs Housing is usually the largest monthly expense for U.S. households. But the cost of housing can vary widely from state to state. In fact, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, some states are still relatively affordable, including Mississippi and Arkansas. Others, including California, are priced well above the national average. A troubling trend in housing costs is that in more than 90% of U.S. counties, according to U.S. Treasury data, both rent and home prices have grown faster than median incomes in recent decades. This mismatch means that even in ZIP codes where housing costs are relatively low, they are still rising relative to incomes. However, lower-cost ZIP codes still have an advantage over higher-cost areas when it comes to affordability. Here’s how the ZIP code discrepancy matters in real-world terms: Imagine two workers earning the same salary, with one living in a high-cost metro area such as San Francisco and the other in a lower-cost city in the Midwest. Even if their earnings are equal, the Midwestern worker will likely spend less on rent or a mortgage, leaving more money for savings, investments or discretionary spending. Read More: Here’s the Minimum Salary To Be Financially Comfortable in 2026 Find Out: How Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires — and How You Can, Too Taxes Taxes are sometimes overlooked by Americans, but that’s unfortunate because they can play a major role in how much disposable income you actually have . Just as with housing costs, taxes can vary greatly by state and even local jurisdictions, so it’s important to understand the specific rules in your ZIP code. Even if you earn a high gross wage, taxes can leave you with less disposable income than someone who earns less in a low-tax state. In addition to income taxes , sales taxes and property taxes can each take a share of your income. The key is balancing your income with the total taxes you pay to determine how much money you are really taking home in your ZIP code. Story Continues Insurance In recent years, insurance costs, which used to be a minor add-on, have skyrocketed in many areas. Thanks to the effects of climate-related disasters and the increasing severity of hurricanes and wildfires, homeowners and property insurance premiums are now a major expense. As reported in the San Francisco Chronicle, for example, new data shows that homeowners in parts of California are now paying far higher premiums than just a decade ago, making homeownership more expensive in high-risk ZIP codes. The Guardian reports a broad shift in insurance markets overall, with national analyses revealing that those in high climate-risk regions may pay significantly more for coverage. These added costs for the essential protection of your home and possessions are now an important factor in determining the true take-home pay in various ZIP codes. Everyday Cost of Living When the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the Consumer Price Index, the inflation it reports is a national average. The price for day-to-day essentials like groceries, utilities, healthcare and transportation all vary by ZIP code, sometimes by a considerable amount. Regional price parity data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis shows that states with higher housing costs also typically have higher everyday expenses . This isn’t true across the board, of course, but it is a general correlation. And if the cost of your day-to-day expenses for things like food, utilities and healthcare is high, it means that your income won’t stretch as far. The Bottom Line Taken together, housing, taxes, insurance and local prices make one thing clear: Your ZIP code affects the true value of your salary. A higher paycheck in a costly area can result in a lower overall standard of living than a more modest income in a less expensive region. This doesn’t mean salary isn’t important. It is. But financial success isn’t just about earning more — it’s about maximizing what you keep and stretching it as far as possible. Before prioritizing a raise or accepting a job offer in a high-cost city, consider how much of that money you will actually have left at the end of the month. In many cases, the answer may surprise you.

Goldman Sachs Raises Public Storage (PSA) Target as Acquisition Advantage Drives Growth On February 21, Goldman Sachs analyst Caitlin Burrows raised her price recommendation on Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) to $330 from $321. The analyst kept a Buy rating on the stock following its Q4 results. She said one of the company’s biggest advantages is its ability to acquire large amounts of assets while still generating strong returns, largely because of its lower cost of capital. This puts Public Storage in a position to pursue deals that many competitors may pass on. She also noted that the company’s ability to continue developing properties across different market cycles has been a steady and reliable source of earnings growth. During the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call, CEO Joseph Russell spoke about what he described as a major leadership transition. He announced that Tom Boyle had been promoted to CEO and Trustee, calling it a generational change for the company. Russell said he had worked closely with Boyle for nearly ten years, and highlighted Boyle’s strong track record as CFO and CIO, where he played a key role in capital allocation, financial planning, and overall business performance. Russell said Joe Fisher, the company’s new President and CFO, brings deep industry experience and is well respected in the REIT sector, making him a strong addition to the company’s leadership team. He also talked about the launch of PS4.0, describing it as the next phase in Public Storage’s long-term strategy. Russell noted that the company has delivered strong results in recent years. Between 2023 and 2025, Public Storage led its sector in same-store revenue growth, NOI growth, and NOI margins. He added that the company also posted the strongest core FFO per share growth and generated total shareholder returns of 18.6%, outperforming its peers during that time. Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) is a self-storage REIT that owns and operates storage facilities across its network. Its properties provide storage space for both individuals and businesses, typically on flexible month-to-month lease terms.

Why it could cost you thousands in added premiums Moneywise Sat, February 21, 2026 at 9:00 AM EST 5 min read Envato/micheledeblock Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below. For many retirees, selling their home is one of the biggest financial windfalls they’ll see outside of work — especially if they’ve owned it for decades, given the rapid rise in home prices. According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies (JCHS) at Harvard University — which used data from the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances — median home equity for homeowners age 65 and over was about $250,000 that year (1). As a result, selling the family home could feel like cashing in a lottery ticket. Top Picks Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP Most Americans earn a dismal 0.39% APY on their cash at big banks. Unlock up to 4.05% APY and pay $0 in account fees instead with a Wealthfront Cash Account However, the transaction could also trigger a hidden Medicare trap that increases your premiums. Without proper planning, you could pay thousands of dollars in unnecessary healthcare costs. Here’s what older American homeowners need to know before pulling the trigger. IRMAA surcharges Medicare is a complicated system with many moving parts, but in this instance it’s important to focus on Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA). IRMAA is a surcharge that can increase premiums for Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D if your income is above a certain threshold. In 2026, the threshold is $218,000 for a married couple filing tax jointly and $109,000 for a single individual (2). In practice, IRMAA is calculated based on your household Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI). It generally includes capital gains, meaning the net profit from the sale of a home can push your income over the threshold, according to the AARP (3). So if you purchased your home for $200,000 in the 1990s and sell it for $800,000 today, the resulting capital gain could easily put you above the IRMAA thresholds and trigger premiums. Depending on the magnitude of your MAGI, your monthly premiums could rise from above $202.90 to as much as $689.90 under the highest IRMAA tier, according to the Medicare Rights Center (4). Selling your home just before you qualify for Medicare isn’t a solution. The Social Security Administration (SSA) generally uses income from two years prior to determine your current MAGI, which means your 2026 premiums are determined by the income you earned in 2024 (2). Story Continues In effect, this surcharge becomes a consideration if you sell your home at any point after turning 63. Given that a typical 65-year-old is estimated to spend roughly $172,500 on total healthcare-related costs over the course of retirement, any additional premiums or surcharges can meaningfully disrupt financial plans. Fortunately, there are ways to avoid this problem. Read More: I’m almost 50 years old and don’t have retirement savings. Is it too late to catch up? Read More: Non-millionaires can now invest in this $1B private real estate fund starting at just $10 How to avoid this trap Perhaps the best way to avoid such an unfortunate situation is to carefully manage the timing of your property sale. If the home you wish to sell is your primary residence and you’ve lived in it for at least two of the past five years, you could qualify for a capital gains exclusion. The Internal Revenue Service allows you to exclude up to $250,000 of capital gains if you’re single and up to $500,000 if you’re married and filing taxes jointly (5). Remember that these exclusions apply only to capital gains, not total sale proceeds. Certain home improvements, selling expenses and some closing costs can be added to your cost basis, which may reduce your taxable gain (6). Older Americans typically spend about 25% of total expenses on housing costs, according to data from the National Council of Aging (7). If you are also facing a housing cost burden, downsizing might be beneficial. If you’re younger than 63 and thinking about downsizing, selling earlier can help you avoid IRMAA altogether. If you’re older, aging in place may reduce the risk of triggering higher premiums. A financial advisor can help you work out the numbers so that the sale doesn’t result in a huge tax bill. That’s where platforms like Advisor.com come in. You can find vetted FINRA/SEC-registered experts near you for free through the platform.

Ultimately, if you’re selling a high-value property or a portfolio of rental properties after age 63, triggering an IRMAA surcharge may be impossible to avoid. You could consider this a one-time toll, especially if your income normalizes in the years after the sale. Still, understanding this potential pitfall can make it easier to plan ahead and avoid surprises.

(NYSE: MAA ) is included among the 14 Best Real Estate Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds . Citi Trims Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) Target Amid Multifamily Sector Uncertainty Top 100 Places Where the Rich People Own Real Estate On February 13, Citi trimmed its price recommendation on Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (NYSE:MAA) to $148 from $155. The firm maintained a Neutral rating on the stock. A few days earlier, on February 9, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Richard Anderson raised his price objective slightly to $141 from $137 and also kept a Neutral rating. He noted that while the multifamily REITs under his coverage reported fourth-quarter results that came in below expectations, the more important factor to know would be new lease rate growth, especially as the market approaches the busy spring and summer leasing season. During the company’s Q4 2025 earnings call, CEO Brad Hill said core FFO came in as expected, even though the market continued to deal with elevated supply levels. He pointed to early signs of improvement, noting that occupancy rose by 10 basis points and same-store blended lease performance improved by 40 basis points compared with the prior year. Hill said the company entered 2026 in a stronger position, with revenue trends starting to move in the right direction. He expects blended lease rates to improve by 110 to 160 basis points, while effective rent growth is projected to increase by about 85 basis points compared with 2025 levels. He also highlighted continued investment in technology and property enhancements. This includes expanding digital initiatives and rolling out community-wide WiFi across its properties. In addition, capital spending on redevelopment and repositioning projects is expected to increase by more than 10% in 2026. Hill also discussed development activity, noting that the company acquired a shovel-ready project in Scottsdale, Arizona, bringing its total active development pipeline to $932 million. The company also purchased land in Arlington, Virginia, where it plans to build a 287-unit apartment community. He added that these development projects are expected to deliver stabilized NOI yields in the range of 6% to 6.5%. Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.

(NYSE: EXR ) is included among the 14 Best Real Estate Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds . Extra Space Storage (EXR) Price Target Cut as Wells Fargo Flags Sector Caution On February 5, Wells Fargo lowered its price recommendation on Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE:EXR) to $150 from $160. The firm reiterated an Overweight rating on the shares. The firm said it remained somewhat cautious on the storage REIT sector, noting that stocks had already climbed about 9% year-to-date on optimism tied to housing trends. However, it warned that 2026 outlooks could come in slightly below Street expectations. During the company’s Q4 2025 earnings call, CEO Joseph Margolis said Extra Space delivered core FFO growth of 2.5% for the quarter and 1.1% for the full year. He acknowledged that operating conditions and supply pressures were still challenging but noted that the environment had begun to improve. Margolis highlighted encouraging signs across the business. He said 16 of the company’s top 20 markets posted year-over-year gains in move-in rates, pointing to improving customer demand. Revenue trends also strengthened sequentially, helping same-store revenue return to growth, rising 0.4% during the quarter. He also emphasized the company’s disciplined approach to capital allocation. During the period, Extra Space repurchased about $141 million of its own shares, acquired 27 operating properties for $305 million, and issued $80 million in bridge loans. Margolis said the company’s broad external growth platform continued to create opportunities across different channels and positioned it well to expand compared with many of its peers. CFO Jeff Norman said the company also made progress on the expense side. Same-store operating costs rose just 1.1%, reflecting improved cost control. Property taxes declined 3.4% as prior increases began to normalize, while property operating expenses, including utilities, dropped more than 5%. He added that these savings were partly offset by higher healthcare costs and increased marketing spending. However, he explained that the additional marketing investment helped drive stronger move-in activity and supported the company’s efforts to build revenue momentum heading into 2026. Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE:EXR) is a self-storage REIT that owns, operates, and manages storage properties. It also provides lending, acquisitions, and development services, offering flexible month-to-month storage options for both personal and business customers.

Citi Reaffirms Confidence in Weyerhaeuser (WY) with Higher Price Target On February 13, Citi raised its price recommendation on Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE:WY) to $32 from $30. The firm kept its Buy rating on the stock, signaling continued confidence in the stock. Earlier in the month, on February 2, Truist also lifted its price objective slightly to $29 from $28 but maintained a Hold rating. The analyst explained that weaker fourth-quarter volumes were mainly due to timing, as the company had already pushed more sales into the summer months before log prices began to decline. Truist added that Weyerhaeuser’s Q1 EBITDA outlook, which calls for results to remain roughly flat quarter-over-quarter, reflects lower pricing and volumes. Management has chosen to hold back some activity for later in the year, when log prices are expected to improve. On January 29, the company reported an adjusted loss of $0.09 per share for the quarter, compared with a profit of $0.11 per share a year earlier. The housing market remained a key headwind, as higher mortgage rates continued to keep many buyers on the sidelines in the second half of 2025. Pending home sales fell 3% from the prior year, reflecting weaker job growth and broader economic uncertainty. Even so, Weyerhaeuser said its timberlands segment is expected to show modest improvement in early 2026, with slightly higher sales volumes and somewhat lower log and haul costs in the first quarter. Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE:WY) operates as a timberland-focused REIT and is one of the largest private timberland owners in North America. The company owns or controls about 10.4 million acres in the US and also manages additional timberlands in Canada under long-term agreements. While we acknowledge the potential of WY as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

AvalonBay (AVB) Price Target Lowered by Citi as Multifamily REIT Outlook Remains Mixed On February 13, Citi analyst Nicholas Joseph lowered his price recommendation on AvalonBay Communities, Inc.

A few days earlier, on February 9, Cantor Fitzgerald also updated its view on AVB, raising its price target to $186 from $179 but maintaining a Neutral rating. The analyst noted that the five multifamily REITs under coverage reported fourth-quarter results that came in below consensus expectations. However, he added that the more important indicator going forward would be new lease rate growth, especially as the market moves into the key spring and summer leasing season. During the company’s Q4 2025 earnings call, CEO Benjamin Schall said the results reflected the overall strength of AvalonBay’s portfolio, along with the steps the company had taken to support growth and the effectiveness of its operating teams. He highlighted strong resident retention, noting that turnover came in at 41%, the lowest level the company has ever recorded. Schall also said the company launched $1.65 billion in new development projects, which are expected to deliver an initial stabilized yield of 6.2%. In addition, AvalonBay raised nearly $900 million in equity on a forward basis, with an implied initial cost of about 5%. He added that the company also repurchased nearly $490 million worth of its own shares, at an average price of $182 per share, reflecting confidence in its long-term outlook.

      "content": "Stop Waiting for Lower Mortgage Rates: The ‘New Normal’ of 6% Explained Martin Dasko Sat, February 21, 2026 at 9:00 AM EST 5 min read According to a new analysis from Realtor.com, the number of American homeowners with mortgage rates above 6% has exceeded those with rates below 3%. In the third quarter of 2025, 21.2% of outstanding mortgages had rates of 6% or higher, while 20% had rates below 3%. While the pandemic era saw historically low rates, the report found that rates have remained above 6% since September 2022. Even though mortgage rates have dropped from the peak of 7.04% in January 2025, it’s evident that they’ll be hovering around 6% for the time being. GOBankingRates consulted with real estate professionals to dive into the “new normal” of 6% mortgage rates and why people shouldn’t expect them to go down anytime soon, especially based on current economic conditions and future trends . Why Are 6% Mortgage Rates Here To Stay? Here are the main reasons why 6% is now the standard. Economic Conditions Have Forced Interest Rates To Remain High “Today’s mortgage rates are influenced by the economy’s current state rather than the recent turmoil in the markets,” remarked Jonathan Ayala, a real estate expert and the founder of a Real Estate Photography company. “The current rate environment is no longer one with ultra-low rates, as inflation, the strength of the labor market and long-term bond yields have altered the expectations in the economy.” The harsh reality is that the current rates reflect the current economic environment. While aggressive economic stimulus was required during the pandemic, the economy is in a different situation now, and it doesn’t look like lower rates will return in 2026. Check Out: Experts Reveal the Exact Credit Score Needed for the Best Mortgage Rates in 2026 Read Next: How Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires — and How You Can, Too Inflation Remains High Jeff Lichtenstein, a broker and CEO of Echo Fine Properties, Boca Raton, cited inflation and higher costs as the key drivers of current interest rates. He believes that to combat rampant inflation, the Fed can’t drop interest rates much further because such a move could overheat the market and bring prices back up again. Ayala agreed that, given current economic conditions, rates are unlikely to decline further until inflation is fully contained and central banks make a substantial policy shift. If inflation doesn’t cool down in 2026, then it doesn’t appear that mortgage rates will come down either. Low Rates Were Never Meant To Last “If you are hoping rates drop back to 3%, it’s important to understand that those levels were never meant to last,” remarked Jake Vehige, the president of mortgage lending at Neighbors Bank . “Mortgage rates in the 6% range are historically normal, and they match today’s economic reality.” While rates may continue to drop slightly in 2026, most experts don’t expect meaningful declines anytime soon. Story Continues “Given that rates have moved little over the past three years and there’s no indication that conditions will change in the near future, 6% rates are something you should get used to,” remarked Melanie Musson, a finance expert with Quote.com . The general consensus is that 6% rates are here to stay. While homeowners may have been spoiled by lower borrowing costs, they must accept that these conditions are no longer the same. Future Trends Indicate Slower Rate Cuts The Fed has indicated it won’t cut rates again for a while after cutting them three times in a row in 2025. An article on CNN reported that after the release of the December jobs report, analysts are forecasting only two rate cuts in 2026 (June and September). It’s also believed that the rate cuts will be slow and gradual. This trend indicates that mortgage rates will remain around 6% for the foreseeable future. Lichtenstein added, “The administration is obviously fighting with the Fed and wants the Fed to lower interest rates, and if the administration has autonomy over the Fed, perhaps it will change rules like the 10-year yield being a factor in mortgage rates.” That’s the only way he sees mortgage rates falling much below 6%. How Can You Lower Your Rates? If you’re looking to get your rates as low as possible, you have options too. Focus on Variables You Can Control Ayala advises buyers to focus on variables they can control. “ Credit scores can be improved, debts can be paid off and shopping around to different lenders can be done to provide meaningful results,” he explained. Buyers may have to be more patient in 2026, but it’s generally advisable to focus on securing a reasonable rate you can refinance in the future rather than putting your life on hold. Work on Improving Your Finances If you want to keep your interest rates as low as possible, you should focus on trying to maintain a high credit score. “Pay your bills on time, don’t borrow more than half of your credit limit and check your credit report for issues,” Musson explained. All that you can do is improve your financial situation to improve your mortgage application so that you get the best possible rate that’s available. Take Advantage of Underused Programs Vehige noted that one of the biggest advantages buyers have is access to underused loan products and assistance programs. He added, “FHA, USDA and VA loans can dramatically reduce or even eliminate down payments. Down payment assistance programs, many of which reset funding early in the year, can also reduce upfront costs.” He also observed that many buyers don’t explore this option because they’re unsure of what to ask, and lenders don’t bring them up. It’s crucial that potential homebuyers shop around for interest rates by exploring all their options, as rates can vary slightly between lenders. When you’re borrowing as much as a house costs, even a small difference can equal hundreds of dollars in monthly savings.

      "content": "Couple was on track for early retirement until kids blew up the budget. Can they still achieve their goal on one income? Chris Clark Sat, February 21, 2026 at 8:30 AM EST 5 min read For years Alejandro and Brady Muñoz followed a straightforward financial playbook: keep expenses low and save aggressively in order to buy themselves freedom later in life. They weren’t chasing luxury, but flexibility in the form of early retirement. The Minnesota couple were committed to the FIRE movement , shorthand for “financial independence, retire early,” and for a while the strategy worked exactly as planned. Then life intervened, the couple told The Wall Street Journal , in ways many young families will recognize (1). Must Read Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP Robert Kiyosaki says this 1 asset will surge 400% in a year — and he begs investors not to miss its ‘explosion’ Two children arrived, paired with a job relocation, and the household shifted from two incomes to one. The dream didn’t disappear, but the timeline suddenly looked far less certain. A solid foundation — and a temporary slowdown Before having kids, both Muñozes worked as engineers and lived on one salary while the other was put toward investments and retirement savings, according to The Journal . Today, Alejandro, 31, earns about $113,000 a year as an engineer and brings in roughly $9,000 more from part-time work at a local fire department. Brady, 27, cares for the couple’s 2-year-old and newborn after stepping away from her career. Despite the income shift, they’ve built meaningful savings. Alejandro’s 401(k) holds about $220,000, bolstered by a strong employer match, and a second 401(k) contains another $140,000. They also have roughly $80,000 invested in brokerage accounts, $54,000 spread across two health savings accounts and about $52,000 in various IRAs. About $1,500 sits in a savings account, along with around $20,000 allocated to certificates of deposit . They also have 529 college savings plans for their children, funded mostly through gifts from friends and family. As for expenses, they live in a home valued just over $400,000. Their mortgage runs about $2,800 a month, including property taxes and homeowners insurance . Outside of their mortgage, the only debt they carry is a $6,000 no-interest medical loan that comes with a $450 monthly payment. Their monthly expenses, which cover groceries, utilities, internet and phone service, transportation, car insurance , health insurance , child-related costs and eating out, come to around $2,650. The couple also gives around $730 each month to charities. Story Continues On paper, the Muñozes seem to have done a lot right. But for a couple aiming to retire early, one expert told The Journal it may not be enough. Kids complicate retirement math When it comes to savings plans of any kind, raising children can upend your budget quickly. A 2025 LendingTree study found the cost of raising a child was $297,674 over 18 years (2). That’s up 25.3% since LendingTree’s last study in 2023. Read More: The average net worth of Americans is a surprising $620,654. But it almost means nothing. Here’s the number that counts (and how to make it skyrocket) “No one should be surprised that costs have risen in recent years, but the type of growth we’ve seen in child care costs is on a whole other level,” Matt Schulz, LendingTree’s chief consumer finance analyst, said in a news release. “There are plenty of reasons for the growth, including inflation, growing labor costs and rising demand. However, whatever the reason, this growth is making an already challenging aspect of parenthood that much worse.” Child care, health insurance premiums, housing needs, food, clothing and transportation costs can all pile up at once. But a temporary pause in savings doesn’t mean a plan is over for good. Balancing kids and savings goals For the Muñozes, the path forward is more about adjusting than scrapping FIRE entirely. One immediate move, certified financial planner Danika Waddell told The Journal, would be using funds from a health savings account to pay off the medical loan and freeing up $450 a month. Refinancing their mortgage , if rates allow, could unlock additional savings. And redirecting that money into Roth IRAs or retirement accounts would help restart long-term compounding without dramatic lifestyle cuts. Waddell believes the couple would need a savings rate of 25% or more to retire before age 60. Building a larger emergency fund is also critical while living on one income, especially with young children. And over time, Brady’s potential return to work, even part time, could dramatically improve the household’s savings rate without sacrificing family priorities. For other parents pursuing early retirement, the lesson is broader. Financial independence doesn’t require a rigid timeline. Increasing contributions when income rises, avoiding lifestyle creep as kids get older and using tax-advantaged accounts efficiently can keep progress moving even through slower seasons.

In 2025, oil prices fell by roughly 20% as the glut widened. Instead, oil prices have seen an unexpected rally through the start of the year on a combination of geopolitical shocks and stronger-than-expected demand. Prices are now higher than they were six months ago, leaving traders \"focused on why a large global surplus ... has not translated into a sustained Brent price decline in 2026 year-to-date,\" Goldman Sachs strategists wrote in a note to clients. More from Yahoo Scout Why are oil prices rising despite oversupply forecasts? What geopolitical factors are driving oil price increases? What are analysts' current price targets for oil? How has demand performed compared to analyst expectations? But those two metrics don't necessarily have to move together, analysts told Yahoo Finance. \"My thinking here is that those two things ... they could live together,\" Jorge León, the head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy, told Yahoo Finance. Futures on Brent crude ( BZ=F ), the international pricing benchmark, have gained roughly 15% since the start of the year, while those on US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude ( CL=F ) are up a slightly smaller 14%. As of January, the International Energy Agency has estimated that the oil market would be oversupplied by roughly 3.7 million barrels per day (bpd) , what Macquarie analysts called an \"extraordinary oversupply\" in a recent client note. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC+, spent much of 2025 unwinding production cuts. In the Americas, US shale production has remained at record volumes alongside growth from other exporting nations in the region, while global demand for hydrocarbons was expected to broadly decline as the world turned toward electrification and other forms of green energy. But prices have risen anyway as traders have priced in a variety of unexpected supply constraints and upticks in demand forecasts. Sanctions from the US Treasury Department on Rosneft and Lukoil, two of Russia's largest oil producers, appear to have taken roughly 600,000 bpd off the market , while exports from the CPC pipeline, which runs between the Caspian and Black seas, have dropped by roughly 440,000 bpd to the lowest level in at least seven years after drone strikes at the Black Sea-side exporting terminal. At the same time, growing prospects of military action by the US against Iran have sent oil prices surging on the possibility of disruptions to the Strait of Hormuz, a critical global chokepoint that sees roughly 20 million bpd of petroleum products cross its waters. Attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea have rerouted tanker traffic around Africa's Cape of Good Hope, tightening physical delivery markets and increasing freight costs for oil products moving between Europe and Asia. Story Continues Oil analysts were largely expecting a supply glut that would push oil prices down through 2026. Instead, prices have rallied through the first months of the year. (AP Photo, File) · ASSOCIATED PRESS Demand has also remained stronger than expected. Slowing manufacturing data out of Europe and China was seen as a bearish signal for prices, but stronger-than-expected transportation figures, demand growth in other regions of the world, and unexpected cold weather snaps have compensated for it. China is also expected to soon bring more storage capacity online as Beijing extends its buying spree. Meanwhile, January US jobs data has far exceeded expectations in another bullish signal for demand, while production from the OPEC+ cartel has remained below guidance as member countries have produced less than quotas allow. Taken together, the IEA recently raised its 2026 demand forecasts in January by roughly 100,000 to 200,000 bpd while reporting that global supply fell by 1.2 million barrels per day month-on-month. None of this is enough to push the market out of oversupply, where consensus broadly remains on a glut of at least 2 million to 3 million bpd. Goldman Sachs is maintaining its price target for Brent crude to average $56 per barrel in 2026, representing a more-than 20% drop from current levels, and Rystad Energy has estimated the \"fair value\" of a barrel of oil right now, based on supply and demand fundamentals at $61. But a combination of heightened geopolitics and above-estimates demand is keeping prices afloat, at least in the short term. \"We still think that we are going to see significant oversupply in the market,\" Rystad's León told Yahoo Finance. But if geopolitical risks remain hot, \"you could still have an elevated oil price even with surplus.\" Jake Conley is a breaking news reporter covering US equities for Yahoo Finance.

      "content": "Better Stock to Buy Right Now: Amazon vs. Home Depot Chris Neiger, The Motley Fool Sat, February 21, 2026 at 8:50 AM CST 4 min read AMZN HD NVDA INTC Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Home Depot (NYSE: HD) have very different businesses: Amazon's profits come primarily from cloud computing, while Home Depot's are from home improvement retail. But both are important consumer-focused businesses that are adapting to rapidly shifting business environments. Here's which stock is currently the better buy. Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » Image source: Getty Images. What's happening with Amazon Amazon is trying to keep pace with its tech rivals as they all incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) into their products and services, which is why the company recently rolled out the more advanced version of Alexa. But Amazon isn't stopping there. The company recently announced it's doubling capital expenditures this year to $200 billion to invest in new AI data center infrastructure. Much of the focus will be on boosting the capabilities of its Amazon Web Services (AWS), which makes sense given the demand for AI and the fact that AWS accounted for 56% of Amazon's operating profit in 2025. AI cloud services will be worth an estimated $2 trillion by 2030, and rival Microsoft has been chipping away at AWS's market share over the past several years. The spending isn't a guarantee for Amazon's AI success, but it should help the company better position itself to fight off rising AI cloud competition. How Home Depot is weathering the housing slump In the first nine months of 2025, Home Depot's sales rose 5.6% to $126.5 billion, but the company's earnings fell about 2% to $11.68 per share. The third-quarter results weren't great either, with the company missing its sales and earnings estimates for the quarter. Home Depot CEO Ted Decker said storms in Q3 hurt the company's sales, along with continued pressure in the housing market . \"We believe that consumer uncertainty and continued pressure in housing are disproportionately impacting home improvement demand,\" Decker said. A dramatic increase in housing prices since the pandemic, combined with elevated interest rates, has kept America's housing market essentially frozen lately. Housing sales fell substantially in January, down 8% from December, in what the National Association of Realtors called \"a new housing crisis.\" That's been a huge problem for Home Depot, which benefits from both buyers and sellers in a hot housing market, with editing homeowners fixing up homes to sell them, and new buyers spending money to make upgrades and personalize their new homes. Story Continues With the housing market stuck in place for now, Home Depot may have to ride out this downturn for a while longer. Verdict: Amazon is the better stock Both Amazon and Home Depot have underperformed the market over the past year, but I think Amazon has the greatest potential to bounce back soon. The company appears on track to benefit from an influx of AI spending, and AWS remains a leading position in cloud computing with 28% market share. Amazon stock is also well priced right now, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 28, compared to the average tech stock P/E ratio of 41. While both Home Depot and Amazon could be great stocks to own over the long term, the housing market being stuck in place makes me hesitate on buying Home Depot at the moment.

J.

Stifel Raises its Price Target on FedEx Corporation (FDX) to $412 and Maintains a Buy Rating At its 2026 Investor Day, FedEx outlined plans to strengthen its position as a leading industrial network, prioritizing premium growth in high-margin verticals, scaling digital and AI capabilities, and transforming its network to improve profitability. The company set 2029 targets of $98B in revenue, $8B in operating income, an 8% operating margin, 11% ROIC, CapEx at 4% of revenue, and $6B in adjusted free cash flow, with a projected $3B increase in operating income driven by initiatives across its realigned reporting segments. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) provides transportation, e-commerce, and business services globally and operates through its Federal Express and FedEx Freight segments. While we acknowledge the potential of FDX as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

(NYSE: PLD ) is included among the 14 Best Real Estate Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds . RBC Raises Prologis (PLD) Target as Industrial Real Estate Outlook Improves Photo by NeONBRAND on Unsplash On February 2, RBC Capital analyst Michael Carroll raised his price recommendation on Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) to $135 from $132. The analyst reiterated a Sector Perform rating, following the company’s fourth-quarter FFO beat. He said the overall results and outlook were mostly in line with expectations, but management’s tone was encouraging. In particular, he noted growing confidence in improving market conditions and the company’s ability to continue expanding its private capital business. According to a February 4 report by The Wall Street Journal, Prologis has been in early discussions with investors about launching a new co-investment fund focused on data centers. If it moves forward, it would mark the company’s first investment vehicle targeting a sector outside its core logistics business. CFO Tim Arndt said investor interest has been stronger than expected, noting that “The interest is very real, and probably beyond our expectations.” He added that the company expects to decide in the coming months whether to proceed and what the structure of the fund might look like. Prologis has already been building data centers for several years, but recently it has stepped up those efforts by hiring additional staff and investing in equipment to support expansion. A new co-investment vehicle could give the company another source of capital to accelerate growth in that segment. For 2026, Prologis expects to start between $4 billion and $5 billion in new development projects, with data centers making up around 40% of that total. By comparison, the company launched about $3 billion in new developments last year, with data centers accounting for only about 10%. As of the end of 2025, Prologis co-owned roughly $34 billion in real estate through its asset management platform, while wholly owning another $128 billion in properties. Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) is a global real estate company focused on logistics and industrial properties. It operates through two main segments: Real Estate, which includes rental operations and development, and Strategic Capital, which manages investment partnerships and co-investment vehicles.

      "content": "XP Could Soar If These 2 Things Go Right Jack Delaney, The Motley Fool Sat, February 21, 2026 at 8:40 AM CST 4 min read XP NVDA INTC In the roughly $117 billion global banking investment market, companies based in more established markets tend to capture all of the attention. Yet l ooking beyond those standard operators can reveal investable opportunities, as some of the fastest-growing financial platforms are emerging from markets that are often afterthoughts to U.S. investors. Brazil-based XP (NASDAQ: XP) , which calls itself a \"one-stop shop\" for financial solutions, is one such company. It offers brokerage accounts, advisory services, offshore investments, and asset management, as well as retail and wholesale banking services. It also boasts nearly 5 million clients and completes 50,000 fixed-income transactions per day. Against that backdrop, two key factors could determine where its stock price goes next. Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » Image source: Getty Images. Asset growth and ecosystem expansion In the fourth quarter of 2025, XP reported total assets of a little more than 2 trillion reals ($400 billion), up 22% year over year. Its assets under management and assets under administration climbed 35% and 44% year over year, respectively, in the quarter. That spotlights a diversified economic base that the company can continue to build upon. If XP can keep expanding that asset pile, it will strengthen its competitive position in Brazil. Clients who manage more of their wealth through XP are likely to be more engaged with its advisors, and to stick with the financial services company. The strength of its asset growth is also a talking point for attracting new customers. Ecosystem expansion plays right into that asset growth, too, as the company enjoys many cross-selling opportunities across insurance, retirement , and credit cards. Rising profitability XP's net income climbed 10% in Q4 to 1.3 billion reals ($247 million), while full-year net income jumped 15% to 5.2 billion reals ($990 million). If it can continue its recent streak of profitability, that could go a long way toward convincing the markets that its results will be durable. To keep the bottom line climbing, the Brazilian company is tapping into artificial intelligence (AI) to augment, rather than replace, its advisors. XP wants its advisors to drive more value by spending more time with clients and less time on operational work. As more clients adopt wealth‑planning tools and sign up for other products in XP's growing ecosystem, the company will be able to generate higher recurring revenue without increasing costs. Story Continues The road ahead The long-term picture for XP looks promising, and its forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of about 10 is attractive. While it's not a perfect comparison, U.S.-based peer Charles Schwab trades at a forward P/E just above 16. With everything above in mind, there are a few details to consider before adding XP to your portfolio. Since the closing bell of its first trading session in 2019, its shares are down by 41%. That slump was driven by a combination of post-IPO overvaluation and Brazil's high interest rates. For 2026, CEO Thiago Maffra also expects a \"challenging environment.\" XP may appeal to patient investors who have a higher risk tolerance, but anyone who buys these shares should be prepared for bumps along the way.

(NASDAQ: EQIX ) is included among the 14 Best Real Estate Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds . BMO Reaffirms Bullish View on Equinix (EQIX) amid Strong Operational Performance Photo by Annie Spratt on Unsplash On February 12, BMO Capital raised its price recommendation on Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) to $1,050 from $925. It maintained an Outperform rating on the stock. The firm said its updated view reflected stronger-than-expected 2026 guidance. The analyst pointed to accelerating momentum across the business. Demand remained strong, with bookings growth reaching 42%. Cabinet additions also stayed healthy, reinforcing confidence in the company’s outlook. A day earlier, on February 11, Equinix projected full-year revenue above market estimates. The forecast reflected rising demand tied to artificial intelligence, which has increased the need for data center capacity. Shares rose more than 6% in extended trading following the announcement. Companies continue to invest heavily in generative AI, and the trend has increased demand for specialized data centers, which has directly benefited Equinix. For 2026, the company expects revenue between $10.12 billion and $10.22 billion. This came in above estimates of $10.07 billion, according to LSEG data. Equinix also expects first-quarter revenue between $2.50 billion and $2.54 billion, ahead of estimates of $2.46 billion. The company has continued expanding its footprint. It invested in new data centers in growing markets such as Chennai, India, and Jakarta, Indonesia, aiming to meet rising demand. In the fourth quarter, Equinix reported revenue of $2.42 billion, slightly below estimates of $2.46 billion. The company said results were modestly affected by the timing of a leasing transaction tied to one of its sites. That transaction is now expected to close in early 2026. Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) operates as a digital infrastructure company. Its platform includes International Business Exchange (IBX) and xScale data centers across the Americas, Asia-Pacific, and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. It also provides interconnection services, digital solutions, and consulting and support to help businesses connect and scale their operations. While we acknowledge the potential of EQIX as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

(NASDAQ: CSGP ) is included among the 14 Best Real Estate Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds . Jefferies Turns Bullish on CoStar Group (CSGP), Citing Strong EBITDA Growth Outlook Photo by Dan Dennis on Unsplash On February 20, Jefferies upgraded CoStar Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSGP) to Buy from Hold. It set a new price target of $67, down from $84. The firm said ongoing investor debate around Homes.com has created what it sees as a compelling entry point for the stock. The analyst also noted that the presence of activists “simply heightens” CoStar’s focus, suggesting increased pressure could help drive execution. Jefferies pointed out that the stock has largely moved sideways over the past five years, as the company went through its biggest investment phase to build out a new business. Looking ahead, the firm expects strong long-term growth, projecting that CoStar’s adjusted EBITDA could triple to $2.4B by 2030, with margins expanding to 36%. On February 18, CoStar also released a new forecast showing that its outlook for the US retail market remains largely unchanged through 2026. The company said retail vacancy, which was previously expected to peak just below 4.4%, is still projected to rise slightly in early 2026 before gradually declining later in the year and into 2027. At the same time, store closures, while slowing overall, are still expected to increase in the first half of 2026. The company noted that uneven retail sales trends are pushing some tenants to reduce their store footprint. Full-year net absorption is projected to come in at just over 16 million square feet, which would mark the third weakest year for retail space demand in the past decade, ahead of only 2020 and 2025. CoStar Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSGP) is a global leader in commercial real estate information, analytics, and online marketplaces. Founded in 1986, the company focuses on digitizing real estate data and providing tools that help businesses and individuals make better property decisions.

Johnny Rice, The Motley Fool Sat, February 21, 2026 at 10:10 AM CST 3 min read RGTI INTC BLK NVDA If you follow quantum computing stocks , you've probably seen some version of this headline: \"Wall Street is loading up on Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) .\" The article in question probably pointed to 13F filings showing that leading money managers like Vanguard, BlackRock , and State Street hold tens of millions of shares of the pure play. At first glance, that might look like a massive endorsement. Vanguard, the largest asset manager on the planet, has a position in Rigetti worth roughly $577 million. That must mean something, right? Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » Active vs. passive In fact, though, Vanguard's large position in Rigetti has nothing to do with the convictions of its fund managers. It exists because the stock is a component of broad indexes like the Russell 2000 . Vanguard offers numerous passively managed funds -- like the Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund -- that track a specific index. That means holding every stock in that benchmark index in the same proportion -- or weighting -- as the index does. When Rigetti's stock price surged by over 1,700% in 2025, its weighting in these indexes increased, and the value of Vanguard's stake grew proportionally, as did its weight in those funds' portfolios. The same is true of BlackRock, State Street, and Geode Capital, and most of the largest institutional holders of Rigetti. What about the active investors? There are exceptions, however. Some active hedge funds like D.E. Shaw also hold sizable positions in Rigetti. But those positions don't amount to much of an endorsement either. D.E. Shaw is a quant fund: It uses algorithms to trade on momentum and other factors that have little to do with anyone's long-term convictions about a stock or beliefs in a company's ability to execute on its vision. Image source: Getty Images. The sorts of funds that buy stocks with the intention of holding them for the medium to long term have tiny Rigetti positions -- less than 0.01% of their portfolios -- that are closer to rounding errors. The bottom line Institutional ownership data is one of the most widely misunderstood signals in retail investing. A name like Vanguard on a shareholder list feels like validation, but it really isn't. It is a mechanical consequence of index inclusion, not a reflection of \"smart money\" loving Rigetti. So, should you buy Rigetti stock? I wouldn't unless you're allocating funds that you're comfortable losing. I think the road toward potential success for Rigetti and other quantum computing pure plays will be long -- much longer than many of the industry's bulls hope. If I'm right, the risks could be existential for Rigetti and many of its peers. Story Continues Should you buy stock in Rigetti Computing right now?

Bernstein said growth is expected to fall below 20% by 2028 and decline through 15% within five years, but added that the company should continue adding new customers, albeit at a 25%–35% slower pace than pre-2024 levels.

RBC also said it is updating its price target models to reflect significant year-to-date multiple compression. On February 6, 2026, Zscaler announced the acquisition of SquareX to expand its zero-trust capabilities into the browser.

On February 10, 2026, Reuters reported that Autodesk filed a lawsuit against Alphabet’s Google, alleging infringement of its “Flow” trademark. According to the complaint filed in San Francisco federal court, Autodesk said it began using the Flow name in September 2022 for visual effects and production management products and was surprised when Google launched its own Flow software in May 2025, targeting similar customers.

      "content": "Is Walmart Still a Buy After Its Strong Run? Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool Sat, February 21, 2026 at 10:06 AM CST 4 min read WMT As consumer confidence has collapsed, investors have increasingly turned to more defensive names when it comes to retailers. This has helped Walmart 's (NASDAQ: WMT) stock get off to a strong start to the year, up about 13% year to date, as of this writing. With the retail giant recently reporting its fourth-quarter results, let's take a closer look to see whether the stock's momentum can continue. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks » Solid sales continue One of the more interesting things about the Walmart story over the past few years is that the retailer has been attracting more affluent shoppers. This has been an important growth driver, especially as lower-income consumers have been stressed due to inflation and tariffs. This showed up once again in Q4, with the company calling out strength in households earning more than $100,000 a year, while sales from households making below $50,000 were weak. Overall, Walmart saw its revenue rise 5.6% to $190.66 billion, surpassing the $190.43 billion consensus, as compiled by LSEG . Walmart U.S. store sales increased by 4.6% to $129.2 billion, while same-store sales also rose by 4.6%. The number of transactions increased by 2.6%, while the average ticket climbed 2%. E-commerce sales, meanwhile, climbed 27%. Walmart credited its Sparky agentic commerce tool for helping improve customer engagement, with customers using the AI agent spending 35% more than non-users. The company also saw a 41% surge in U.S. ad revenue in the quarter. Internationally, sales jumped 11.5% to $31.2 billion, and were up 7.5% in constant currencies. The growth was led by Walmex (Mexico), China, and Flipkart (India e-commerce). International e-commerce sales grew by 17%, and international ad revenue rose 10%. Sam's Club U.S., its warehouse store concept, saw sales (excluding fuel) increase by 4% to $21.7 billion. Same-store sales, excluding fuel, also grew by 4%. Transactions rose 5.3%, while the average ticket fell by 1.3%. E-commerce sales soared 23%. Membership fees rose 6.1% year over year. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) rose 12% to $0.74. Despite tariff pressure, the company saw its gross margin increase by 13 basis points in the quarter and operating income rise 10.8%, or 10.5% in constant currency, helped by investments in automation and the growth of higher-margin businesses like advertising. Image source: Getty Images. Looking ahead, Walmart projected its first-quarter sales to rise between 3.5% to 4.5%, with adjusted EPS of between $0.63 to $0.65. Story Continues For the full year, it's looking for revenue growth of 3.5% to 4.5% and adjusted EPS of between $2.75 to $2.85. However, that was short of the $2.96 consensus. Is the stock a buy? While I think Walmart is doing a great job driving revenue growth and is seeing nice operating leverage through automation, ad revenue, and AI, I'm not buying the stock when it's trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of above 40 times. That multiple is just difficult to justify, given its mid-single-digit revenue growth and low single-digit operating income growth. The stock likely remains a defensive safe haven, but the upside looks limited. Should you buy stock in Walmart right now? Before you buy stock in Walmart, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walmart wasn’t one of them.

That's the big story and, ultimately, why I wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole. But if you are considering it, you'll want to think about these key facts before you hit the buy button. Canopy Growth is a penny stock One of the first major warning signs is that the stock is trading around $1. That's penny stock land , an area of the market that is known for being high risk. Stock prices generally only fall that low when a company is struggling. Sure, there could be a huge upside opportunity if a penny stock turns around, but there's material downside risk if the company's business doesn't prove sustainable over the long term. Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » Image source: Getty Images. Notably, penny stocks often struggle to tap the capital markets for cash through stock sales. And when they do, the cost is very high given the low stock price, with investors feeling the hit via increased shareholder dilution. Canopy Growth just recapitalized its balance sheet In addition to the stock price, Canopy Growth's financial strength is a potential issue. In early 2026, the company recapitalized its balance sheet. There were several transactions involved, with the company effectively pushing out its debt maturities. That's a positive; however, to get the deal done, it had to offer incentives, including warrants . This isn't the type of thing a financially strong company usually has to do. Canopy Growth is buying another business Despite the low stock price and questions about the company's financial strength, it is still moving ahead with the acquisition of MTL Cannabis. This move is expected to improve the company's geographic positioning in the marijuana sector, but the all-stock deal will increase Canopy Growth's share count. The stock involved here will increase dilution and will make it harder for the company to turn a profit. Canopy Growth is mired in red ink There are clearly several material red flags when you consider Canopy Growth. One of the biggest is the company's ongoing losses. In fact, it has never been profitable. Sure, the losses appear to be getting smaller, but that isn't enough to make this high-risk penny stock worth buying. Most investors should probably watch Canopy Growth from the sidelines. If the business can become sustainably profitable, it may be worth reconsidering it. But until that point, I wouldn't touch it. Story Continues Should you buy stock in Canopy Growth right now?

      "content": "Forget AI Stocks: This Stablecoin Provider Is the Utility Stock of Digital Assets Emma Newbery, The Motley Fool Sat, February 21, 2026 at 9:41 AM CST 4 min read CRCL DX-Y.NYB Circle Internet Group (NYSE: CRCL) is the world's second-biggest stablecoin issuer. Price-wise, the company has had a rocky ride since its initial public offering (IPO) in June 2025. Initially priced at $31, Circle immediately jumped to $69 and soared to over $260 within weeks. As of Feb. 17, it is trading at around $62. Down 76% from its high, Circle's performance does not compare well with top artificial intelligence (AI) stocks . Still, as investors start to fear AI overvaluation, this stablecoin provider is worth a closer look. Stablecoins -- tokens that represent traditional currencies, such as the U.S. dollar -- are soaring. Not only do they offer a meeting point for traditional finance and cryptocurrency, but they could also underpin AI agent payments. Here's how Circle is building the payment infrastructure for the future. Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » Image source: Getty Images. Circle is a digital asset utility stock for an AI world Circle Internet Group provides a compliant, audited stablecoin powerhouse as well as tokenization services. As more assets and transactions move on-chain, reputable providers will power that shift. Circle has partnerships with over 100 key players, including Visa , Deutsche Börse Group , and Itau . These position it to become the backbone of this emerging payment structure. There is now $73.6 billion of Circle's USD Coin (CRYPTO: USDC) in circulation, up from $35.5 billion in the third quarter of 2024. Its biggest competitor, Tether (CRYPTO: USDT) , is a long way ahead with $183.6 billion. However, Tether is complicated from a regulatory perspective as it has been dogged by questions over its reserves. Circle's reserves, on the other hand, are verified by a third-party auditor, making it more attractive to businesses with compliance requirements. Another important aspect of Circle's emerging infrastructure is that stablecoins are already supporting AI agents, which can perform tasks autonomously. Blockchain technology enables fast, low-cost transactions that can take place 24/7, making it ideal for the types of micropayments AI agents need to make. The programmable nature of some blockchains also helps -- the code can set the conditions under which AI transactions might happen. Circle underpins blockchain adoption Right now, a lot of Circle's revenue comes from the interest it earns from its reserves. That totaled $740 million in Q3 2025, up 66% year over year. It has to keep funds in reserve for each stablecoin it issues, which makes for a solid income base. If stablecoin issuance soars, as many predict, that could significantly boost Circle's yield-generating reserves. Story Continues However, the company is also susceptible to falling interest rates, making diversification essential. Non-reserve revenue will be a key metric to watch when Circle reports its Q4 earnings on Feb. 25. It is already increasing its income from subscriptions, transactions, and services. In the future, fees from AI agent transactions could become a major revenue stream. Circle has long-term potential, but it isn't yet a safe, defensive utility stock. It could face regulatory headwinds, its price is still closely connected to volatile cryptocurrency markets, and stablecoins remain relatively untested.

Coffee shops aren't just a place to eat and drink; they're a place to gather with friends, a \"third place\" after home and work. Longtime Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz always advocated for this. Fans of Compass Coffee, however, have seen their so-called third place disappear, as the chain has steadily closed locations after its January Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing . That filing put the entire company at risk, with Compass filing for permission to immediately terminate 10 leases, although it did share hopes that suitors would be interested in those locations, according to documents on PacerMonitor . Now, Compass Coffee, which has closed 10 locations with 17 still operating as part of its bankruptcy process, may have a lifeline that could save the cafes, if not the brand. British coffee brand wins Compass Coffee auction When Compass Coffee filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy , London-based coffee chain Caffè Nero submitted a \"stalking horse\" bid of $2.9 million for the brand and its assets. \"The stalking horse bidder is the bidder who sets the floor for other bidders to bid against. By establishing a baseline bid, the stalking horse bidder protects the debtor from a situation where it might only receive unreasonably low bids for its assets,\" the Troutman Pepper Locke law firm shared on its website . Caffè Nero ultimately was the winning bidder, but had to raise its price to $4.75 million, Compass CEO Michael Haft told The Washington Post . More Bankruptcy: Key auto parts and services company files Chapter 11 bankruptcy Key travel brand files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy Self-driving-car company files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection The higher sale price means there were other bidders. The bankruptcy court still needs to approve the sale. \"Over the course of three days, Haft said, the auction went through 24 rounds of bidding among the five groups looking to purchase Compass’s inventory, equipment, intellectual property, and other assets. One of the bidders — a private-equity firm — submitted a bid but was disqualified because it didn’t have the necessary capital to complete a deal,\" the Post reported. Compass has found a buyer that wants to operate coffee shops. Shutterstock · Shutterstock What's next for Compass Coffee? For the time being, assuming its bid gets approved, Caffè Nero plans to continue operating the remaining 17 locations under the Compass name. Haft told The Post it was unclear whether it would ultimately rebrand the cafes. \"A hearing to approve the sale is scheduled for Feb. 26 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Columbia. If the sale is approved and closes, Caffè Nero would become the new owner of substantially all Compass Coffee assets,\" according to Daily Coffee News . 繼續閱讀 Caffè Nero prides itself on the sourcing of its coffee beans and its roasting method. \"We set ourselves apart through our roasting technique. Each coffee batch is gently roasted in high-quality equipment able to capture the fullest flavor from every bean,\" the company shared on its website . Caffè Nero, which was founded in 1997, has over 1,000 locations across Europe and the Middle East, as well as about 40 in the United States. Its U.S. cafes are mostly in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Pennsylvania, according to the store locator on its website. This isn't the first time the coffee brand used acquisitions for growth. \"Prior acquisitions of smaller, specialty-focused chains include the purchase of 21 locations of U.K. specialty roaster 200 Degrees in 2024,\" according to Global Coffee Report.

Warren Buffett has never been one to hide behind tax shelters or complain about what he owes Uncle Sam. At Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting in 2024, the then-CEO — and who remains chairman — made a striking statement about corporate taxation. It wasn’t a political speech or a carefully rehearsed soundbite. It was vintage Buffett: straightforward, grounded, and backed by numbers that are hard to argue with. Don't Miss: Fast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share Put professional stock research to work in a single ETF — explore Motley Fool Asset Management's factor-based funds. Berkshire Hathaway, he told the assembled shareholders, sent a check for over $5 billion to the U.S. federal government the previous year. And if just 800 other companies had done the same? “No other person in the United States would have had to pay a dime of federal taxes,” he said. “Whether income taxes, no Social Security taxes, no estate taxes — up and down the line.” It was the kind of line that makes an arena full of shareholders applaud — not because it was rehearsed, but because it was true. “We’ll Pay It” Buffett has long been transparent about how he views the relationship between profitable companies and the government. At the meeting, he framed it in characteristically simple terms. “The federal government owns a part of the earnings of the business we make,\" he said. \"They don’t own the assets, but they own a percentage of the earnings. And they can change that percentage any year.” Trending: This ETF issuer isn't chasing the index — it's building tools for income, leverage, and conviction The current corporate tax rate sits at 21%, established under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. But Buffett made clear he doesn’t expect that number to stay put. With the national deficit ballooning and political appetite for spending cuts remaining limited, he suggested that higher rates are “quite likely.” The government, he said, “may decide that someday they don’t want the fiscal deficit to be this large” and “may decide they’ll take a larger percentage of what we earn.” His response to that possibility was remarkably unbothered: “We’ll pay it.” There was no talk of restructuring, relocating, or lobbying for loopholes. Just a plainspoken acceptance that taxation is part of the deal — and one he considers fair. Story Continues Rather than treating that as a critique of others, Buffett turned it inward. “I would hope things develop well enough with Berkshire that we say we’re in the 800 club,” he said, “and maybe even move up a few notches.” It was a goal that had nothing to do with shareholder returns or stock price — and everything to do with the way Buffett has always measured success. For a man who still lives in the same Omaha house he bought in 1958 and has pledged the vast majority of his fortune to philanthropy, paying a large tax bill isn’t a problem to be solved. It’s a sign that things are going well. See Also: You Saved for Retirement — But Do You Know What You'll Keep After Taxes? A Different Kind of Billionaire Buffett’s stance on taxes is hardly new, but it stands in increasingly sharp contrast to the broader conversation happening among the ultra-wealthy. As debates around billionaire taxes, unrealized capital gains proposals, and minimum effective rates have intensified in recent years, a notable faction of the rich has responded with threats to relocate . Hedge fund executives have floated moves to lower-tax states or countries entirely. Some in the tech and crypto space have openly explored jurisdictions like Dubai, Singapore, and beyond — sending a clear signal that higher taxes could trigger an exodus. Buffett’s message runs in the opposite direction entirely. He has long credited the United States with creating the conditions that made Berkshire Hathaway’s success possible, and he sees paying taxes as a form of giving back to the system that enabled it. “I think it’s appropriate,” he said at the meeting, “that a country that has been as generous to our owners” should receive something in return. While Buffett's comment highlights how different the tax conversation looks at the corporate level, most people don't get to decide what tax policy or billionaire behavior looks like going forward. Taxes still come due, rules still change, and planning ahead matters more than predicting what lawmakers or CEOs might do next. That's where working with a financial advisor can help , turning uncertainty into a plan so surprises at tax time feel a lot less surprising.

Courtney Carlsen, The Motley Fool Sat, February 21, 2026 at 8:50 AM PST 3 min read CVX CL=F Dividend stocks can be an excellent source of passive income for investors. Chevron (NYSE: CVX) is one company that has rewarded dividend investors for years. Despite operating in the volatile oil and gas industry, Chevron and its business model have proven to be resilient; in fact, the company has provided investors with a growing dividend payout for 39 consecutive years. Here's why Chevron is a smart dividend stock for investors to buy today. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks » Chevron's oil and gas advantage Chevron operates as an integrated oil and gas company , with upstream and downstream operations that help diversify its earnings and provide it with resilience in an industry vulnerable to changes in spot gas and oil prices. In recent years, Chevron has been prudent with its finances, prioritizing a disciplined approach to spending, debt reduction, shareholder returns, and positive cash flow. The company is taking a measured approach to capital expenditures, and last year it achieved $1.5 billion in structural cost reductions. It expects to achieve $3 billion to $4 billion in structural cost reductions by the end of 2026. Chevron's growth is driven by high-margin assets, including deepwater assets in the Gulf of Mexico (the Anchor and Whale projects). Its acquisition of Hess, which includes Hess' 30% stake in Guyana's Stabroek Block, gives it massive, low-cost, multi-decade production capabilities. Image source: Getty Images. In addition, the company produced over 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the Permian Basin. Its drilling rig efficiency has more than doubled since 2022, allowing it to drill development areas at a significantly lower cost. The company is leveraging technology to more efficiently extract oil and gas, and has engineered its portfolio to cover both capital expenditures and dividends even if Brent oil hits below $50 per barrel. This low break-even point provides a safety margin even if oil prices were to fall from here. Its drilling business is complemented by its downstream operations, which include refining and marketing. Its refineries in the United States have a high Nelson Complexity Index, enabling them to process diverse crude types into high-value products and generate higher refining margins than peers. Its downstream segment alone is projected to generate $4 billion in annual free cash flow through the end of the decade, providing stability to its overall portfolio. Story Continues A long history of dividend raises Chevron has done an excellent job of managing its business and its balance sheet over the past several decades. Not only does it offer an attractive dividend yield of 4%, but it has also increased its annual dividend payments for 39 consecutive years. On top of that, it has repurchased shares in 18 of the past 22 years. Looking ahead, Chevron projects free-cash-flow growth of 10% annually over the next five years. If you're seeking passive income and diversification from the energy sector, Chevron is an excellent choice. Should you buy stock in Chevron right now?

      "content": "Marathon Petroleum Returned $4.5 Billion to Shareholders in 2025. Here's Why It Could Happen Again. Bryan White, The Motley Fool Sat, February 21, 2026 at 11:59 AM CST 3 min read MPC MPLX Marathon Petroleum (NYSE: MPC) , the largest independent U.S. refiner, is up 21% this year after fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $4.07 per share crushed analyst expectations. Refining margins did the heavy lifting, with the company capturing 114% of the benchmark crack spread, up from 96% in the third quarter. That drove cash from operations to $2.7 billion, nearly 60% above the prior year. During the year, Marathon returned $4.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. The cash return story, though, is getting stronger from here, and it doesn't need peak margins to hold. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks » A two-pronged cash flow model The company runs on two profit engines. MPLX LP (NYSE: MPLX) , its midstream subsidiary, owns pipelines and processing plants that generate fee-based income moving natural gas and liquids from wellhead to market. The refining segment processes over 3 million barrels per day across three regions, turning crude into gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Refiners measure their execution against a benchmark crack spread, the theoretical margin from processing a barrel of crude. Oil prices have pulled back while refined fuel demand has held up, widening that spread. Marathon's refining margin hit $18.65 per barrel in the fourth quarter, up 44% year over year. Valero (NYSE: VLO) managed just $13.61 over the same period. Image source: Getty Images. The other half of Marathon's story runs through MPLX, where the distributions don't swing with crack spreads. That's what separates Marathon from a pure refiner . MPLX distributions to Marathon are set to exceed $3.5 billion annually over the next two years, up from $2.8 billion. That income stream alone covers the dividend and base capital spending, while the refining segment's cash flow goes toward buybacks. On the fourth-quarter call, management said it expects the repurchase pace to hold this year, with $4.4 billion in buyback authorization still on the books. What margins need to do next The primary risk is that Q4's refining margin is cyclically elevated. If crack spreads compress, it would hit the refining segment first, and it accounts for roughly half of the company's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Management sees tight global refining supply and steady distillate demand into 2026. Regional closures, including a California refinery this spring, further tighten the domestic market. Story Continues The stock currently sits around $200 per share, with a 1.9% dividend yield. At about 7.4 times trailing EBITDA and roughly 15 times forward earnings, Marathon is fairly valued for a refiner with this much midstream stability. How margins hold through 2026, as new Asian refining capacity comes online, is the one variable worth watching. Should you buy stock in Marathon Petroleum right now?

Matthew Benjamin, The Motley Fool Sat, February 21, 2026 at 11:57 AM CST 3 min read UNH ^GSPC INTC NVDA Many stocks in the healthcare sector are up strongly in 2026. But not health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) . The stock is down almost 13% this year, far underperforming both the S&P 500 healthcare sector (up 1.7% this year) and the broader S&P 500 (up 0.6%). What's going on? Well, the company announced fourth-quarter results on Jan. 27, and investors were not impressed. UnitedHealth beat Wall Street's expectation on earnings by a penny, which is not overly impressive. Worse, revenue of $113.2 billion came in under the consensus analyst forecast of $113.8 billion, never a good sign. Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » Even worse for the share price, management's outlook for full-year 2026 revenue was unexpectedly low. The company said it expects revenue of $439 billion, about $15 billion lower than Wall Street was expecting. If that comes to pass, it will be the company's first annual revenue contraction in more than 30 years. The share price plummeted 20% that day. Disappointing news on Medicare Advantage But that's not all. On the very same day, the Trump administration proposed keeping federal payments to Medicare Advantage plans basically flat -- with an increase in payment rates of less than 0.1% -- in 2027, which is far less of an increase than what analysts and insurers expected. Industry analysts expected that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which sets the rate, would propose an increase of between 4% and 6% for the year. Medicare Advantage, or privately run health insurance plans contracted by Medicare, is critical to UnitedHealth's business. In fact, the company is the largest provider of Advantage plans in the U.S., with a market share of 29%. At the end of 2025, the company served almost 9.4 million people through these plans. So when the federal government limits growth for Advantage plans, it has a huge negative impact on Advantage plan providers. Image source: Getty Images. In fact, the entire health insurance sector got hit by the news on Advantage payments. And it looks a lot like a government effort to end certain billing practices by Advantage providers. It's somewhat surprising, as Wall Street analysts expected the Trump administration to be friendlier to health insurers. Instead, President Donald Trump has called the insurers \"big, fat, rich,\" and seems to be including them among companies that should charge consumers less. Story Continues For UnitedHealth, the news on Medicare Advantage comes at a difficult time, when the revenue outlook already looks to be softening. So it was all bad news for UnitedHealth in recent months; thus, the stock slide. I don't expect a major improvement in the outlook anytime soon. Should you buy stock in UnitedHealth Group right now?

Justin Pope, The Motley Fool Sat, February 21, 2026 at 11:43 AM CST 4 min read MSFT Stock prices tend to fluctuate over time, but Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is working through a doozy of a slump, at least by the tech giant's standards. Shares of Microsoft have dropped more than 25% below their high, the stock's second-worst drawdown in the past 10 years. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks » A proven, world-class tech giant such as Microsoft doesn't go down easily. The decline signals trouble; Wall Street is sounding an alarm. So, what exactly is going on? Several factors are simultaneously impacting the stock. Here is what they are, what they mean, and whether Microsoft stock is likely to trade higher or lower a year from now. Image source: Getty Images. Why is Microsoft down? Several reasons, actually For starters, Microsoft is somewhat between a rock and a hard place with artificial intelligence (AI). It has invested and partnered closely with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT. Microsoft has come to rely on OpenAI, which currently accounts for $281 billion of Azure's $625 billion cloud computing backlog. However, OpenAI is struggling to fend off competition, and scrutiny has heated up over its ability to fund spending commitments of over a trillion dollars while its business burns through billions. Microsoft itself plans to spend $120 billion on AI infrastructure this year alone, a potential disaster if OpenAI falters. Lastly, software has emerged as one of the first industries where AI could really make waves. There has been a widespread sell-off in software stocks, and Microsoft's legacy Windows and productivity software are crucial cash cows. Put it all together, and Microsoft is under more pressure than at any point in recent memory. How concerned should investors be about Microsoft? There's no telling how low Microsoft may drop. Instead, investors should try to gauge how likely worst-case scenarios are. Microsoft has acknowledged that it is developing its own AI models to diversify away from OpenAI. For OpenAI, the company is working to raise $100 billion in new funding to stabilize the business for the next few years. It doesn't seem likely that OpenAI will just collapse. It has also begun punching back against competitors, releasing Frontier to develop AI agents, a new Codex model for writing code, and acquiring OpenClaw, a popular open-source AI agent program. For Microsoft, investors may underestimate how sticky its software is. For example, the world essentially ground to a halt in July 2024 when a third-party cybersecurity bug caused a global outage among Windows computer systems. It still seems like a massive stretch for companies to rip out such essential software in favor of unproven AI, especially now that Microsoft is integrating AI features across its products. Story Continues Investors should look for market angst to fade a bit as these things play out. Will the stock trade higher or lower one year from now? As Microsoft's valuation declines, the potential risks decrease and the upside increases. The stock already trades at less than 25 times earnings, near its lowest P/E ratio over the past decade. It doesn't seem like a stretch to believe that Microsoft stock will trade higher in a year than it does now, just as long as the business ultimately proves its fundamentals are intact. Should you buy stock in Microsoft right now? Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

(NYSE: LLY ) on Wednesday shared topline results from the landmark TOGETHER-PsO open-label Phase 3b trial evaluating the concomitant use of Taltz (ixekizumab) and Zepbound (tirzepatide) compared to Taltz alone for plaque psoriasis and obesity . The study demonstrated the efficacy of its drugs Taltz and Zepbound in treating psoriasis and obesity. 27.1% of participants receiving Taltz and Zepbound reached complete skin clearance (Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) 100) and at least 10% weight loss, compared to 5.8% of patients treated with Taltz alone, meeting the primary endpoint. Taltz and Zepbound delivered a 40% relative increase over Taltz monotherapy in the proportion of patients who achieved PASI 100 (40.6% vs.29%).

CSL will receive an upfront payment of $100 million and be eligible to receive potential clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments, as well as royalties on global net sales. CSL will retain exclusive rights to develop and commercialize clazakizumab for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). CSL is advancing the ongoing POSIBIL 6ESKD Phase 3 trial of clazakizumab.

Trending: Blue-chip art has historically outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, and fractional investing is now opening this institutional asset class to everyday investors. Technical Analysis The stock is currently trading 2.7% below its 20-day simple moving average (SMA) and 3.2% below its 50-day SMA, indicating short-term weakness. However, it remains 4.3% above its 100-day SMA and 17.6% above its 200-day SMA, suggesting longer-term strength. The RSI is at 48.22, which is considered neutral territory, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. Meanwhile, the MACD shows a value of -5.0984, below its signal line of -3.9365, indicating bearish pressure on the stock. Story Continues The combination of neutral RSI and bearish MACD suggests mixed momentum, indicating that traders should be cautious in their positions. Key Resistance : $1088.50 Key Support : $1012.50 Analyst Consensus & Recent Actions Eli Lillystock carries a Buy Rating with an average price target of $1141.70. Recent analyst moves include: Deutsche Bank : Buy (Raises Target to $1285.00) (Feb. 9) JP Morgan : Overweight (Raises Target to $1300.00) (Feb. 5) Cantor Fitzgerald : Overweight (Raises Target to $1205.00) (Feb. 5) See Also: The ‘ChatGPT of Marketing' Just Opened a $0.85/Share Round — 10,000+ Investors Are Already In Benzinga Edge Rankings Below is the Benzinga Edge scorecard for Eli Lilly, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses compared to the broader market: Value Rank : 3.49 — The stock is trading at a steep premium relative to peers.

It’s escalating with no end in sight and not everyone is celebrating and dividing the spoils equally. Shares of Samsung (SSNLF) are on cloud nine after investors learned of reports that the company is looking to charge 20% to 30% more for its next-generation HBM4 chips . Great news overall? Well, not quite for everyone across the Pacific. Micron ( MU ) stock slipped in early trading despite being in the same market. What gives? Ultimately, all of this leads to a big issue, one that investors cannot afford to ignore: That’s what Micron’s chief business officer, Sumit Sadana , had to say regarding the entire AI-driven shift reshaping the industry. If that headline becomes true, and the financial data suggests so, pricing power in high-bandwidth memory is entering a new era. Samsung quietly reboots its AI memory strategy.Photo by NurPhoto on Getty Images · Photo by NurPhoto on Getty Images Samsung targets 30% higher HBM4 prices as AI demand explodes Samsung, if local media reports are accurate, is looking to upend the pricing market for HBM4 chips. The hike could be close to as much as 30% above its prior HBM3E generation. That’s bold and perhaps market-shaking — at least to me. Related: Apple’s Siri shocker is flashing a warning AAPL bulls can’t ignore HBM chips constitute critical hardware for advanced AI accelerators. They are mainly produced by Nvidia ( NVDA ) and other chipmakers, and they are responsible for powering hyperscale data centers. Now for many people, AI is all hype. But that's not the case for me at all. Generative AI models are getting bigger very quickly. As inference workloads grow, the need for faster memory bandwidth is outpacing the supply. Why is Samsung so sure of itself? Well, the matter is essentially financial: Over the past year, DRAM contract prices are up over 170% . Some DDR5 memory modules have reportedly gone up by about 500% since late 2024. As we get closer to 2027, AI server deployments are moving faster. Samsung is already on the ropes thanks to HBM3 performance benchmarks, giving competitors like SK Hynix and Micron a chance to get into AI-focused memory. But Samsung wants to get back the power to set prices, which is why investors in Seoul acted right away. Micron’s financial surge spells record margins, $200B expansion It's funny that Micron's finances aren't doing too badly right now, meaning that Micron might actually benefit from increased HBM prices. Micron's gross margin is up 18.5% in the first quarter of 2024 to 56% in the most recent quarter . And we are going to get even better from here; the guidance says that the gross margin is set to get to 68% gross margin in the current period . These levels are getting close to those of the best AI chip makers. Story Continues Related: Veteran analyst drops a shocker on Cisco Revenue growth has accelerated sharply as well, thanks to data center demand. Micron also locked in forward visibility: There are reports that HBM4 capacity is sold out for 2026. Long-term supply agreements with big AI customers are increasing capacity. More and more buyers are looking for multiyear contracts to make sure they get their share. That urgency explains the company’s aggressive expansion. Micron is spending up to $200 billion over time to build more factories in the U.S., including huge new ones in Idaho and New York. The Idaho campus has two fabs, each 600,000 square feet, and ground will be broken in 2027. The scale is staggering: 70,000 tons of steel per fab. The construction process requires hundreds of thousands of cubic yards of concrete. Years-long construction timelines. The way I look at it, this is not incremental growth; Micron is looking for structural capacity expansion. So why did Micron stock slip? The divergence has more to do with positioning than fundamentals . South Korea’s KOSPI index is up around 35% this year, thanks to memory chip enthusiasm, in sharp contrast to U.S. equity markets, which are far more restrained at the moment. Related: Mark Cuban’s bombshell AI warning is a reality check for big tech Micron shares quadrupled over the past year, making profit-taking a plausible factor. In contrast, investors perceive Samsung as lagging behind in HBM, potentially causing a market overreaction. The pricing report may signal that its competitive gap is narrowing. But for me, the intriguing question is whether the market is underestimating how tight supply remains. Brad Gastwirth, head of global research at Circular Technology, recently said: If Gastwirth is accurate, then memory pricing will remain elevated for some time, longer than typical cycle watchers are looking out for. A structural shift or another memory supercycle? Having closely observed the semiconductor sector and witnessed numerous cycles of booms and busts, I believe that this moment is unique. For a long time, memory was perceived as a commodity that went through cycles without mercy. Too much supply hurt margins. Producers slashed capex. Repeat. Related: Nvidia CEO shocks AI community over the one thing he didn’t do AI has the potential to rewrite this script. Hyperscalers are investing tens of billions of dollars annually into AI infrastructure. Data center memory per server is climbing. Not just training, but also inference workloads are keeping demand high. If high-bandwidth memory continues to be a problem, pricing power may last longer than it has in the past. But there is a risk. Massive capital expenditures always carry timing danger. If AI spending slows or capacity eventually overshoots demand, margins could compress sharply. For now, however, Samsung’s pricing ambitions send a clear signal: The AI memory race is not cooling down. And even if Micron investors hesitated in the short term, the underlying economics of high-bandwidth memory are almost always strong. Samsung lays down the gauntlet We should contextualize Samsung's attempt to raise HBM4 prices by up to 30%. It isn’t just a competitive maneuver; the test is how tight the AI memory market truly is. If customers accept, that might strengthen the impression that enhanced memory has gone from being a commodity to a strategic need. If that's the case, the recent drop in Micron's stock price may be more noise than a warning. But if Samsung turns on the heart, Micron will be on notice.

Emma Ockerman Aktualisiert Sat, February 21, 2026 at 1:57 PM EST 2 min read TRU The tail end of last year saw a spike in borrowing as rising prices hit consumers hard. New personal loans rose by 24% in the third quarter of 2025 when compared to a year earlier, driven by borrowers with the lowest credit scores, while new credit card accounts spiked by 11.7%, with strong growth from both subprime and superprime consumers, according to new data out Thursday from TransUnion. Mehr von Yahoo Scout What's driving the surge in personal loans and credit cards? How are rising delinquency rates affecting consumer debt markets? What are the outlook and trends for credit markets? What role is inflation playing in consumer borrowing behavior? \"People are turning to credit as we continue to see stubbornly high inflation,\" Michele Raneri, vice president and head of US research and consulting at TransUnion, told Yahoo Finance. Though inflation now appears to be cooling, prices are nonetheless up significantly from pre-pandemic levels — about 26% higher last month than in January 2020. Average hourly earnings have increased in turn, but consumer sentiment last year was markedly negative as Americans felt burned by ballooning costs and a stagnant job market. \"Just because the inflation number has come down during this quarter doesn't mean it hasn't accumulated behind it,\" Raneri said.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's most recent report on household debt found 12.7% of credit card balances were 90 days or more overdue in the fourth quarter of 2025, the highest level since 2011. TransUnion, meanwhile, found that credit card balances grew 4.2% at the end of last year, a growth rate that held for the fourth quarter in a row. Personal loan balances — despite being at a record high of $276 billion — are roughly flat, at about $8,400, compared to 2024 levels when averaged across all accounts. Moving forward, credit card origination volumes — people seeking new accounts — are expected to moderate in 2026, according to TransUnion's forecast. \"Our anticipation is that everything is kind of settling down,\" Raneri said.

      "content": "Nvidia vs. Alphabet: Which Is the Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Now? Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool Sat, February 21, 2026 at 2:02 PM EST 4 min read NVDA GOOG INTC Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are two giants competing in the artificial intelligence build-out. For the most part, these two don't compete against each other, and Alphabet is primarily a client of Nvidia's. However, Alphabet has also built a graphics processing unit (GPU) alternative that competes with Nvidia's product, although it's serving a specific niche. Of these two, which one is the better AI stock to buy now? Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » Image source: Getty Images. Alphabet's TPU is starting to challenge Nvidia's GPU Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) , which have long been the go-to choice for computing problems that require massive horsepower. GPUs can process multiple calculations in parallel, making them a great option for arduous workloads like AI. GPUs are also great for other computing tasks, like cryptocurrency mining, drug discovery, engineering simulations, and their original use case, gaming graphics. However, when a GPU is only utilized for one specific workload for its entire life, the extra capacities that clients have to pay for are somewhat wasted. That's where a specialized unit like the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) from Alphabet comes in. Alphabet has spent the past decade developing the TPU in collaboration with Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) . Now, it has become a force in the AI computing world. TPUs aren't suited for every AI task, but they can excel in some areas, which is why Alphabet also keeps its partnership with Nvidia and maintains access to the latest and greatest hardware from it. Furthermore, a client likely won't want to run all of their workloads on Alphabet TPUs. The only place to gain access to them is through Google Cloud, and if all of your workloads are run on Alphabet-specific hardware, then it becomes impossible to switch to a different provider if the price soars too much or there is some other reason you want to switch. Maintaining a balance between Nvidia's GPUs and Alphabet's TPUs is a smart move for many clients, and it bodes well for both companies. While Nvidia has other use cases for its GPUs outside of AI, the reality is that the majority of Nvidia's revenue is coming from this sector. Nobody knows what AI spending will look like five years from now, and this could become an issue for Nvidia if AI spending decreases. Story Continues Alphabet doesn't have this problem. It has several other, non-AI businesses, like the Google search engine, YouTube, and its Google Cloud business. Google Cloud is Alphabet's cloud computing wing, and will thrive even after the AI build-out is complete because clients will still be running AI workloads on its servers. This subscription platform is a perpetual cash cow for the business, and also benefits from non-AI workloads. However, Nvidia is growing far faster than Alphabet. Nvidia provides more upside For their current fiscal years, Wall Street analysts expect Alphabet to grow its revenue at a 7% pace, while Nvidia grows at a 65% pace. That's a massive mismatch in growth and shows how much Nvidia is thriving versus Alphabet. Still, Alphabet's stock is more expensive from a forward earnings perspective. GOOG PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts As the chart indicates, this isn't a common occurrence recently and should be taken as a strong buying sign for Nvidia stock. However, I'd bet Alphabet stock is far more steady over the next few years, while Nvidia's is subject to the whims of the market's capacity for AI risk. I think both stocks are excellent to own, but Nvidia represents a stock that has much higher upside right now . Alphabet is still a solid pick and will be a steady grower, but its upside is fairly capped compared to Nvidia. Should you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "content": "Charlie Munger Handed His Family Fortune Over to The Chinese Warren Buffett Who Flipped It Into $400 Million — 'We Made Unholy Good Returns' Jeannine Mancini Sat, February 21, 2026 at 2:01 PM EST 4 min read BRK.A Conviction is easy to talk about. It's harder to wire. Then-Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger didn't just praise talent — he backed it with tens of millions of dollars from his own family fortune. The recipient? Li Lu , the investor Munger later referred to in a 2023 Financial Times profile as the \"Chinese Warren Buffett.\" Munger, who passed away in 2023 at age 99, met Li at a Thanksgiving dinner in 2003. What struck him wasn't Li's dramatic backstory — fleeing China after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, earning degrees at Columbia, launching his own firm. It was something simpler. Don't Miss: This AI Helps Fortune 1000 Brands Avoid Costly Ad Mistakes — See Why Investors Are Paying Attention Motley Fool's analysts have built a new lineup of passive ETFs — explore which \"Foolish\" strategy fits your investment goals. \"I'm not interested in revolution. I'm a capitalist,\" Munger told FT. \"It was his capitalist aptitude that attracted me.\" That aptitude would soon be tested. Long-Term Thinking, Very Real Results When Li launched a new fund under Himalaya Capital in 2004, Munger entrusted him with $88 million to manage, urging him to stick to long-term value investing rather than short-term trading. The outcome? By 2023, that investment had grown roughly four- to fivefold. \"We made unholy good returns for a long, long time,\" Munger said in the same FT  profile. \"That $88 million has become four or five times that.\" At the 2018 Daily Journal annual meeting, where he served as chairman, Munger was blunt about how rare this kind of trust was for him. \"In my life, I've given money to one outside manager, and that's Li Lu,\" he said. \"No others in my whole life. And I have no feelings that it would be easy to find a second.\" Trending: This ETF issuer isn't chasing the index — it's building tools for income, leverage, and conviction That's not hype. That's Munger drawing a very hard line. At that same meeting, he explained why Li stood out. \"The first rule in fishing has always been fish where the fish are… and Li Lu just went where the fishing was good.\" In other words, while most investors were crowding into heavily analyzed U.S. markets, Li focused on China, where opportunities were bigger and competition was thinner. That philosophy showed up clearly in two defining investments. One was an early bet on Kweichow Moutai, purchased when the stock traded at just four to five times earnings. Munger joked that Li \"backed up the truck\" and bought aggressively — a move that turned into one of the most celebrated consumer investments in Asia. Story Continues Another defining call was BYD. Li invested in the company in 2002, when it was still primarily a battery maker. That conviction later influenced Berkshire's $230 million purchase of a 10% stake in 2008. Munger has acknowledged he wasn't initially enthusiastic about the auto industry. \"I didn't like the auto business,\" he told FT. \"But it worked so well, the early investment in BYD was a minor miracle.\" See Also: Most Retirement Plans Ignore Taxes — See If Yours Does BYD would go on to become the world's largest electric vehicle producer by sales — a result that validated Li's long-term thesis in dramatic fashion. For Munger, the decision wasn't about geography or headlines. It was about judgment . He believed Li thought independently. He believed he had discipline. And he believed he'd stay rational when others wouldn't. In a Facebook tribute after Munger's death, Li later described him as the \"enlightened embodiment of modern-day Confucianism,\" a reflection of the moral framework Munger believed should underpin capitalism. Strip it down, and the story is straightforward. Charlie Munger saw rare investing talent. He trusted it early. And he let it compound .

      "content": "Billionaire Druckenmiller buys $152 million in megacap tech stocks Silin Chen Sat, February 21, 2026 at 1:47 PM EST 4 min read ^IXIC Stanley Druckenmiller likes to make big bets. The 72-year-old billionaire once said that if you see something really exciting, “Bet the ranch on it.” With the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite down about 2% year to date, perhaps his recent moves can offer investors some hints. Druckenmiller was formerly George Soros’s right-hand man. He helped make the famous bet against the British pound in 1992, a trade that “broke the Bank of England.” He is the former chairman and president of Duquesne Capital Management, which he founded in 1981 and managed until it closed in 2010. Over its nearly three decades, the firm delivered an average annual return of 30%. After Druckenmiller closed Duquesne Capital to outside investors, he actively managed his wealth and investments under a family office structure, now called Duquesne Family Office. Duquesne Family Office returned 37% over the past year and gained 123.25% over the past five years, according to data from Stockcircle . Duquesne Family Office returned 37% over the past year.Getty Images · Getty Images Druckenmiller buys $152 million in Amazon and Google, exits Meta Some megacap technology names were among Druckenmiller's most notable buys in the fourth quarter of 2025, according to Whalewisdom's data based on 13F filings . Amazon ( AMZN ) remained one of the fund’s largest positions, with Druckenmiller adding  300,870 shares worth about $63 million, increasing the stake by 68.8%. Amazon is the fund's seventh-largest holding. Notably, Amazon was also one of George Soros's fund's largest buys in the fourth quarter, with Soros Fund Management adding 133,385 shares. Related: Billionaire George Soros buys $137M in AI chips, trims Alphabet Druckenmiller also sharply raised his Alphabet ( GOOGL ) position by 276.7% from the previous quarter, adding 282,800 shares worth roughly $89 million. Druckenmiller's moves come as both companies continue to ramp up spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure and cloud. Shares of the Google parent surged roughly 30% during the fourth quarter, while Amazon gained 5%. In contrast, Druckenmiller fully exited Meta, selling all 76,100 shares after the stock tumbled 10% in the previous quarter. Within semiconductors, Druckenmiller reduced his Taiwan Semiconductor ( TSM ) stake by 29%, bringing it to his eighth-largest holding, down from the fourth-largest position in Q3 2025. TSMC is the world’s largest chip foundry and a critical manufacturer for Nvidia ( NVDA ) and other AI chip makers. On Jan. 15, the company posted strong fourth-quarter results, as earnings per ADR rose 35% year over year to $3.14. Revenue for the quarter reached $33.73 billion, up 25.5% from a year ago. Gross margin, a key profitability measure, was 62.3%, up from 59.5% a year ago. Story Continues Druckenmiller initiated a new position in ON Semiconductor (ON), a smaller bet worth $29 million. Druckenmiller slashed health care, betting on airlines and Brazil Health care remains Druckenmiller’s largest exposure, though several positions were reduced. Natera (NTRA) remains Druckenmiller's top holding at 12.75% of the portfolio, despite a roughly 22% trim. Teva Pharmaceutical ( TEVA ) was cut sharply by 64.6%. Insmed (INSM) was also dumped by 38.9%. Despite the reductions, the three health care names remain among Druckenmiller’s top five holdings. The health care sector is often considered defensive, as the demand for products and services is relatively stable. Top 10 holdings of Duquesne Family Office as of Dec. 31, 2025: Natera (NTRA): 12.80% Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ( XLF ): 6.70% Insmed (INSM): 5.74% Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ( RSP ): 5.00% Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA): 4.08% Woodward (WWD): 3.97% Amazon (AMZN): 3.79% Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM): 3.67% Coupang (CPNG): 3.55% iShares MSCI Brazil ETF Call Options ( EWZ call): 2.99% Druckenmiller moved back into airlines, reopening positions in United Airlines ( UAL ), Delta Air Lines ( DAL ), and American Airlines ( AAL ), after having exited United and Delta in the third quarter of 2025 and American earlier in the second quarter. At the same time, Druckenmiller made a sizable bet on Brazil. He established new positions in the iShares MSCI Brazil ETF (EWZ) and call options tied to the same fund.

But Bitcoin has gotten caught in one of its deepest struggles yet, with no obvious way out. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has plunged more than 40% from its peak, and the usual playbook isn’t working — dip buyers have vanished, and the forces that would normally fuel a rebound are now working against it. Gold is winning the macro-hedge argument. Stablecoins are winning payments. Prediction markets are winning speculation. Most Read from Bloomberg Private Prisons Face an Existential Threat Under Trump's New Detention Plan How Zoning Won A Shaker Revival Points to Something Deeper Than a Trad Obsession White House Ballroom Design Approved by Trump Commission After One Hearing The strange part: none of this is happening because the system failed Bitcoin. Washington has never been more accommodating. Institutional adoption has never been deeper. Wall Street has never been more bought in. Bitcoin got everything it wanted — and it wasn’t enough. That means the defining struggle of this crypto era isn’t about price. It’s about purpose. And this selloff is forcing a question Bitcoin hasn’t needed to answer when prices were rising: if it isn’t the best hedge, the best payment rail or the best speculation — what, exactly, is it for? “The central story of Bitcoin was ‘number go up’ and we don’t have that anymore,” said Owen Lamont, portfolio manager at Acadian Asset Management. “We have number go down. That is not a good story.” The Narrative Problem Unlike stocks or commodities, Bitcoin lacks fundamentals. Its value rests almost entirely on belief — on the strength of narratives that persuade new buyers to join. Those stories are faltering. Retail traders who bought into the Trump-fueled rally are now deeply underwater. “New speculative venues such as prediction markets — and commodities exchanges! — are siphoning away attention from crypto markets,” said Noelle Acheson, author ofnewsletter. “Now that BTC is a ‘macro asset,’ it has to compete with so many other alternatives, most of which are easier to understand and easier to explain to trustees, clients, your board, etc.” The Defections A clear signal came in November. Jack Dorsey — long one of Bitcoin’s most vocal corporate evangelists — announced his Cash App would begin supporting stablecoins. For years, Dorsey treated Bitcoin maximalism as doctrine. His pivot was a signal: the payments race had moved on. In Washington, stablecoins have become the center of gravity. The bipartisan Genius Act passed easily. Regulators are openly encouraging dollar-backed token infrastructure. Even within crypto, Bitcoin is no longer the sole focus. Tokenization, blockchain-powered derivatives and cross-border stablecoin payments are emerging as credible use cases — none of which require Bitcoin to function. Story Continues “If anything, stablecoin activity could be correlated with activity on Ethereum or on other chains. And stablecoins are for payments,” said Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, a tokenization platform. “I don’t think anybody today sees Bitcoin as a payment mechanism.” The Financialization Trap Ironically, Bitcoin’s unraveling began during its own rise. The 2025 bull run triggered a rush of institutional infrastructure that was meant to cement its legitimacy. Instead, it stripped the asset of its mystique. Once a cipher for libertarian escape, Bitcoin now resembles every other Wall Street instrument: a ticker in a drop-down menu, bundled with zero-day options and volatility products. What once required a rabbit hole now takes a brokerage login. Bitcoin’s defenders still point to its engineered scarcity — the 21 million cap, halving cycles, hard-coded deflation. But in markets, the scarcity that matters isn’t just of supply — it’s of attention. And the supply of things competing for that attention is now effectively infinite. Altcoins. Altcoin derivatives. Tokenized stocks. Structured leveraged products. Scarcity may be coded, but abundance is manufactured. And even the code itself is facing scrutiny — the rise of quantum computing has begun to fuel fears that Bitcoin’s cryptographic foundations, long assumed to be unbreakable, may not be permanent. It’s a distant threat, but in a narrative-driven asset, the mere possibility is corrosive. The Hedge That Wasn’t Even after years of “digital gold” hype, Bitcoin has failed its most important macro test. Despite geopolitical jitters and enduring dollar weakness, gold and silver have staged volatile rallies this year, while crypto has only gone down. Flows confirm the divergence. US-listed gold and gold-themed ETFs pulled in more than $16 billion in the past three months, while spot Bitcoin ETFs saw roughly $3.3 billion in outflows, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bitcoin’s market cap has shrunk by over $1 trillion. “People are realizing that Bitcoin is what it’s always been — which is simply a speculative asset,” said Tom Essaye, president and founder of Sevens Report and a former Merrill Lynch trader. “Bitcoin is not replacing gold, it’s not digital gold, it doesn’t do the same thing, it doesn’t give people the same utility that gold does. It’s not an inflation hedge — there are other better hedges, frankly, where you don’t have to worry about the volatility. And it’s not a chaos hedge either.” The Treasury Unwind The digital-asset treasury model was supposed to be Bitcoin’s corporate identity. Companies like Strategy Inc. amassed Bitcoin during the bull run and issued shares against it, creating a self-reinforcing loop that conjured billions in market cap and gave institutional investors a way to express conviction without touching the asset directly. For a time, it worked. Now the loop has reversed — and with it, the credibility of the model. The largest DATs have plunged over the past year — some far more than Bitcoin itself. Many now trade below the value of their holdings. The Speculation It Lost Bitcoin’s hold on speculative culture is slipping, too. Prediction platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi — with binary outcomes, fast resolution and real-world stakes — are now playgrounds for the same dopamine-chasing traders who once rode meme coins. This isn’t fringe: Polymarket’s weekly notional volume has surged over the past year. Even Coinbase Global Inc. has added prediction contracts. The dopamine didn’t disappear. It just moved. “The prediction markets are becoming the next craze for the same DIY investors who enjoy the speculative nature of crypto,” said Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at ETF shop TMX VettaFi. “That could mean less overall interest in crypto,” she said, though she added that “it could also mean a shift to more long-term, serious investors.” The Hidden Wiring Then there’s the growing mismatch between how Bitcoin is accessed, and how it trades. Spot ETFs have made it effortless to buy. But Bitcoin’s price is still influenced by offshore derivatives markets, where traders routinely run 100-to-1 leverage. These venues operate on automated liquidation engines: when positions breach margin thresholds, they are force-closed and sold into the order book instantaneously, triggering cascading liquidations that can crash the spot price in minutes. That machinery was fully exposed in the October crash. Billions in leveraged positions were unwound in a flash. By the time most ETF holders checked their portfolios, the damage was done. The Bull Case None of this means Bitcoin is over. It remains the most liquid digital asset, with deeper order books and broader exchange coverage than any rival. Spot ETFs have made Bitcoin a permanent fixture in portfolios. And the very regulatory clarity now benefiting stablecoins may ultimately lift the entire ecosystem. More to t",

James Brumley, The Motley Fool Sat, February 21, 2026 at 12:48 PM MST 5 min read CHWY The overall market may still look overbought and feel overvalued. But a handful of stocks have actually lost some ground of late, even if they didn't deserve to. With that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of three of them worth buying while you can still get them at a discount. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks » 1. Chewy It's been a rough past few months for Chewy (NYSE: CHWY) shareholders. Every time it looked like the stock had made a bottom, it then found a way of moving even lower. Indeed, after recently reaching yet another new 52-week low, shares of the online pet supply store and pharmacy are now priced at less than half of June's high. There's still no guarantee this is a trade-worthy bottom, to be clear. It's more likely to be one than not, however, given the underlying company's performance of late. Last quarter's revenue was up a little more than 8% year over year, extending a growth pace that's been in place for years. And the company continues to grow its income after swinging to a small but sustained profit in 2022. CHWY Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts The crux of the bullish argument for owning CHWY here, however, isn't what it's done, but rather, how it's done it. See, of its fiscal third quarter's total revenue of $3.1 billion, almost 84% of that was sales made to customers signed up for a recurring subscription to pet food, medicine, or even treats and toys. That's up from just 80% a year earlier and markedly better than the comparison of just under 71% five years ago. It matters simply because consumers who sign up for such subscriptions often have a \"set it and forget it\" frame of mind, and as such are cheaper and easier to retain as paying customers. Chewy is normalizing this e-commerce business model and ultimately enjoying widening profit margins as a result. 2. Uber Technologies Yes, Uber Technologies (NYSE: UBER) stock tumbled earlier this month after reporting fourth-quarter profits that fell short of expectations , adding to a sell-off that's been underway since November. All told, UBER shares are now down nearly 30% from that peak and knocking on the door of a new 52-week low. The trading crowd's largely misreading the situation, though. Despite missing most Q4 per-share earnings estimates with its reported profit of only $0.71 per share, that bottom line was still up 27% year over year on a 22% improvement in total trips as well as a 20% year-over-year increase in revenue. The ride-hailing company's looking for comparable top-line growth for the quarter currently underway as well, and perhaps more importantly, expects the profit margins that were pressured last quarter to widen again, with per-share earnings projected to improve 37% year over year. Analysts, meanwhile, are calling for comparable growth for at least the next couple of years. Story Continues Image source: Getty Images. This outlook, of course, just reflects the much bigger dynamic that Uber Technologies is plugged into. That's consumers' growing disinterest in driving themselves, or for that matter, even owning a car. Blame unaffordability, mostly. It's now become cheaper to outsource personal transportation. There's no end in sight to this dynamic either. 3. ServiceNow Last, add ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) to your list of growth stocks to buy while they're on sale. This one's down nearly 50% from its July peak. It's not too terribly difficult to figure out why. ServiceNow is an artificial intelligence stock, and AI stocks have been sold off en masse on worries of the technology's actual value compared to its cost. This broad concern ignores important company-specific nuances, however, like the fact that it's generative AI and artificial intelligence hardware companies with the most yet to prove. ServiceNow offers workplace automation solutions that provide clear, marketable value. These offerings include no-code app development, automated customer service, and digital security, just to name a few. This practicality allows ServiceNow to turn a consistent -- and consistently rising -- profit. Last quarter, it turned nearly $3.6 billion in revenue into a net income of a little over $400 million, capping off a full-year bottom line of more than $1.7 billion on $13.3 billion in sales. Both were up more than 20% year over year. Analysts are looking for comparable growth this year and next too, despite the apparent slowdown other AI companies seem to be facing. Most investors appear to have lost sight of how well this company is positioned to continue thriving for the foreseeable future even if other names in the AI business don't. The analyst community hasn't, though. In addition to most of them still rating NOW as a strong buy, its consensus price target is holding strong at $187.69, up 78% from the stock's current price. Once investors are reminded that the nature of ServiceNow's business shields it from more sweeping headwinds, don't be surprised to see this stock start moving back toward that target.

At the same time, gold and silver rose in futures trading. But the two events aren't really related. They have more to do with what's going on, first, in industry and, second, in the Middle East . And the odds are that prices will be volatile into the next week or so while the Trump Administration weighs a possible attack on Iran. After that, bulls are sure silver will remain strong in 2026, but perhaps not as feverishly high as it was in January. Earlier in February, JPMorgan Chase raised its price target on silver to $81 an ounce. Silver shot past that target on Friday , trading above $82, up nearly 6% on the week. That's down nearly 38% from its peak price of $121.785 per troy ounce on Jan. 29 as silver trading morphed from bullish to absolutely feverish. Silver being refined in Austria.G · G The reasons silver prices rose Silver fell to as low as $72 an ounce on Feb. 16 but has rallied since for three reasons: Worries about possible Persian Gulf hostilities have generated a move to safe assets in many markets for a second time in the last 12 months. Gold and silver tend to win when geopolitical worries shoot higher. The confidence that continued expansion of data centers and computer systems to handle artificial intelligence applications will continue to be strong. Silver is a key component used in these industries. The Supreme Court ruling will do nothing to limit growth in U.S. government deficits and deficits in other countries, Bloomberg noted . So, central banks will continue to buy gold and silver as hedges. The U.S. Dollar Index has fallen more than 10% since the end of 2024. The index measures the dollar against a basket of currencies.

      "content": "Robert Kiyosaki Doubles Down on Bitcoin at $67,000, Citing Two Big Catalysts Bibhu Pattnaik Sat, February 21, 2026 at 1:45 PM MST 3 min read BTC-USD DX-Y.NYB ETH-USD On Saturday, Robert Kiyosaki said he bought another full Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC ) for $67,000 even as he described the cryptocurrency as \"crashing,\" framing the purchase as a bet against a potential breakdown in the U.S. dollar and a coming supply milestone for Bitcoin. The move fits with his long-running stance of ignoring crypto volatility while he builds positions across Bitcoin, Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH ), and hard assets as protection from what he sees as worsening U.S. debt dynamics. In a post on X, he tied the purchase to two catalysts: a belief that a debt-driven dollar slide could trigger massive money creation and that the network is nearing the \"21 millionth Bitcoin\" being mined. In the same post, Kiyosaki argued that a wave of new currency issuance would follow a dollar crisis, calling the Federal Reserve \"The Marxist Fed\" and describing future money creation as \"fake dollars.\" Although Bitcoin is crashing I bought one more whole Bitcoin for $67k. Why? Two reasons: # 1: Because the Big Print will begin when the US debt crashes the dollar and \"The Marxist Fed\" begins printing trillions in fake dollars. #2: The magical 21 millionth Bitcoin is… Kiyosakis Bitcoin Bet Amid Market Chaos Beyond Bitcoin, Kiyosaki has also said he keeps buying Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH ) and does not anchor his decisions to day-to-day price moves in either token. That approach sits alongside his broader distrust of traditional policy and finance gatekeepers, including the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury, which he has criticized as being led by people he believes misunderstand money and the economy. Kiyosaki has also pointed to physical gold and silver as core holdings, arguing that precious metals have a long history as money, while positioning Bitcoin as a digital counterpart to those stores of value. Asset Accumulation Amid Economic Turmoil Kiyosaki’s ongoing investment strategy reflects a broader trend among investors looking for alternatives to traditional assets. Last year, he predicted that Bitcoin could soar to $250,000 by 2026, while also setting targets of $27,000 for gold and $100 for silver, illustrating his belief in the long-term value of these assets amid economic uncertainty. This perspective aligns with his criticism of institutions like the Federal Reserve, which he accuses of undermining true wealth through the creation of “fake dollars.\" Kiyosaki’s approach of accumulating assets during periods of market fear not only emphasizes his conviction in their potential but also serves as a cautionary approach for investors navigating volatile environments. Story Continues Is The $1 Million Bitcoin Target Realistic? In prior commentary, Kiyosaki has said he expects Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC ) to reach $1 million, laying out a time frame that spans the next several years to a decade. He has linked that bullish outlook to his view that U.S. national debt is climbing and that the dollar's purchasing power is eroding, which he sees as a reason to keep adding to alternative assets. In Saturday's post, as reported by X, Kiyosaki also claimed Bitcoin would surpass gold once the network reaches the 21 million coin milestone, tying his thesis directly to Bitcoin's capped supply. Why Scarcity Is Key To Bitcoins Future Kiyosaki framed the approaching 21 million cap as a key inflection point, suggesting scarcity is the feature that could elevate Bitcoin's appeal versus traditional hedges. His portfolio framing has repeatedly combined scarce assets—Bitcoin and Ethereum on the digital side, plus gold and silver in physical form—around a single macro worry: instability tied to U.S. debt and the institutions that manage the currency.

Index funds are passive funds that track an established index, making changes only when the index itself changes, rather than actively trying to beat the market. Index funds are appropriate for all kinds of investors, but they can be especially valuable for less experienced investors. A low-cost index fund can be a great way for both beginner and advanced investors to invest in the stock market. These funds generally are broadly diversified, thus reducing your risk compared with investing in individual stocks, and they’re a great choice if you want to minimize the time you spend investing, too. On top of that, index funds can offer attractive returns, in part by reducing the fees you pay. With all these advantages, it’s little wonder that legendary investor Warren Buffett recommends index funds (notably a Standard & Poor’s 500 index fund) to most investors. Here’s more information on how index funds work and a list of some of the cheapest index funds on the market. How do index funds work An index fund is an investment fund that tracks a specific collection of assets called an index. The index can include stocks, bonds and other assets, including commodities such as gold . The most well-known index is the Standard & Poor’s 500 index (S&P 500). An index fund is a passive investment that tracks the assets included in the index. It aims to match the performance of the index by holding the same assets in the same proportions as the index. An index fund can be bought and sold as either an exchange-traded fund (ETF) or a mutual fund.

Story Continues What makes an index fund low-cost? A fund management company charges investors for creating and managing the fund using what’s called an expense ratio . The expense ratio tells you what percent of your investment you’ll pay as a fee to the fund company. For example, a low-cost index fund might charge an expense ratio of 0.06%. That means you’d pay a fee of $6 annually for every $10,000 you invested in the fund. Whether a fund is low cost is relative. Fund costs have been declining for decades, and today investors can easily find funds charging an expense ratio below 0.50%, or a cost of about $50 annually for every $10,000 invested. But the best index funds charge much less than that, often less than 0.10%, or about $10 annually for every $10,000 invested. Another cost to watch out for is a sales load . The sales load is basically a commission to the salesperson, and it’s money that comes right out of your pocket. The good news is that it’s easy to avoid this cost, since many fund management companies offer no-load funds. And it’s a fee that applies only to mutual funds, so if you’re buying an ETF, you can rest easy here. How to invest in low-cost index funds 1. Determine the type of fund you want First, you’ll need to determine what your investing goals are. Are you investing for the highest-possible returns over a long timeframe and can ride out short-term volatility? Then you’ll want a stock index fund. Are you investing for more steady returns at the cost of a lower total return? Then you might want to consider a bond index fund. For any stock investment, you should be able to leave your money invested at least three to five years without touching it in order to earn potentially higher returns. In the short term, stocks can be volatile, though they do well over time. Learn more: 3 steps to set your investment goals 2. Research available index funds Once you know the type of fund you want, you can start your research, looking for either stock index funds or bond index funds, or both. For your search, you can turn to free screeners such as those at Morningstar, which has separate screens for ETFs and mutual funds. You can filter the funds by their expense ratio and then sort them by their returns, often over periods such as one year, three years, five years and 10 years. The lowest-cost funds charge less than 0.10% as an expense ratio. You’ll also need to see if the fund is an index fund or an actively managed fund. Almost all ETFs are index funds, while a much smaller percentage of mutual funds are index funds. You’ll need to look further to determine if a mutual fund is an index fund, though it often says so in the fund’s name. Also, a stringent screen for low-cost funds likely eliminates most actively managed and non-index mutual funds anyway. It can be valuable to stick to broadly diversified funds — ones that own many investments across industries — to reduce your overall portfolio risk. 3. Place your trade Once you’ve determined the fund you want, you can place your trade. To do so, you’ll need to know the fund’s ticker symbol, a three-, four- or five-letter code, which you’ll input in your broker’s trading platform. You’ll also need to know how much the fund costs per share to determine how many shares you can buy with your available funds. Once you’ve input the trade info, hit the buy button and you own shares in the fund. What to consider when investing in low-cost index funds The two most important things to know about investing in low-cost index funds are the index’s long-term returns and the cost to own the index fund. That is, you’ll want to earn the potentially largest return while paying as little as possible to the fund company to achieve that return. Long-term returns Investors looking for a top index fund should first check out what returns it could produce. An index’s long-term performance is a good gauge to how it might perform in the future, but it is not a guarantee. Any fund will list its performance over a one- to 10-year period as well as from the fund’s inception. It will show you the annualized return over these periods, so you can get a sense of what you could earn in an average year. Stock funds are likely to perform better long term than bond funds, but bonds may outperform stocks over shorter time periods . During periods of rising interest rates, bond prices will fall. The S&P 500, for example, has returned about 10% annually over long periods of time. The S&P 500 is a widely followed index, but many fund companies create their own proprietary indexes that are not as widely known. So you’ll want to check the long-term returns of the index fund over time to see how it could perform. And when investing in funds don’t forget the importance of mean reversion. This technical investing term effectively means that a fund’s performance moves toward its long-term average. So, funds that have been outperforming their long-term average for the last year or two are more likely to revert to their long-term average than to sustain their",

(NASDAQ:MNDY) . What happened According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated February 13, 2026, Whetstone Capital Advisors, LLC reported selling all 79,172 shares of monday.com Ltd. during the fourth quarter. The estimated value of the shares sold was approximately $15.33 million, calculated using the average price for the period. The quarter-end position value decreased by $15.33 million, reflecting both the share disposition and price movement.

With a scalable SaaS platform and a global customer base, the company leverages modular product offerings to address diverse operational needs. What this transaction means for investors monday.com was the largest of the 12 positions that Whetstone Capital closed out in the fourth quarter of 2025. As with most filings, the fund did not explain its decision. However, the sale follows a trend against SaaS stocks that have an unclear position in the marketplace (if they have a position at all) as artificial intelligence (AI) replaces their functions at a substantially lower cost. Additionally, monday.com was over 4% of Whetstone’s fund in Q3, meaning it sustained a substantial hit as the stock’s price cratered over the last year. Investors should not take this sale as a sign that Whetstone has abandoned technology stocks. A large number of the 54 stocks in the fund are tied to the tech industry. Also, it opened a position in the fintech stock Block in Q4. Story Continues Nonetheless, AI is undoubtedly going to change the tech industry and many other businesses.

      "content": "How Many Fed Rate Cuts Can We Expect this Year? Matthew Benjamin, The Motley Fool Sat, February 21, 2026 at 4:03 PM CST 4 min read NVDA INTC For months, futures markets have priced in just two quarter-percentage-point cuts this year from the Federal Reserve. Such rate cuts are enormously important to investors and financial markets because they almost inevitably give stocks a boost, as expectations of easier borrowing create optimism that companies can both reduce their interest expenses and borrow more to expand, while more favorable financing for consumers should boost their spending. Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » Yet, despite menacing pressure from the White House in recent months to lower the target interest rate dramatically, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has remained steadfast in his commitment to let the economic data -- on jobs and inflation, in particular -- determine how the Fed sets monetary policy. As a result, in January the U.S. central bank did not cut the target rate at all, much to President Donald Trump's consternation. Suddenly, however, it's beginning to look like the Fed could cut its target rate more than twice this year, which would be an extremely welcome development on Wall Street. Inflation is falling slightly faster than expected The Fed has been waiting for inflation to close in on its 2% target, but overall price growth has remained stubbornly above that level for months. Image source: Getty Images. Now, however, inflation seems to be falling more quickly than expected. Consumer prices rose 2.4% (on an annual basis) in January, while economists had expected them to rise 2.5%. Taking out volatile food and energy prices, the Consumer Price Index was up 2.5%, the lowest level since April 2021. If that trend toward 2% continues, it suggests the Fed will have room for a third or even a fourth quarter-percentage-point cut this year. Even some Fed officials, who are generally very cautious about predicting rates, are voicing that possibility. Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee recently said that if the path to 2% continues, \"I still think there's several more rate cuts that can happen in 2026.\" And tariff-related price increases -- so far at least -- have been modest, mostly confined to some goods categories. In addition, Powell's term as Fed chief ends in mid-May, when he likely will be replaced by Trump nominee Kevin Warsh. Warsh's plans for monetary policy are somewhat complicated -- he would like to both cut the Fed's target rate while shrinking the Fed's massive balance sheet. It's not exactly certain how that would impact overall borrowing costs. But certainly, if Trump has nominated Warsh, investors can assume he assured the president -- initially at least – that he'll push for a more aggressive rate-cutting schedule. Story Continues Right now, the Fed Funds Futures Market puts the chances of three or more cuts in 2026 at 43%. That's up from 25.6% just a month ago. So there's certainly growing optimism that the Fed is starting to lean toward additional rate cuts this year. That would give the entire stock market a shot in the arm. Stay tuned.

But this time, it's institutional versus retail investors. Tesla stock is down 9% thus far in January, testing investors' mettle, with the broader market flat for the year but prone to big swings.

How does Tesla's AI strategy compare to automotive fundamentals? Why are institutional investors selling Tesla stock significantly? What impact could SpaceX IPO have on Tesla? The big debate: whether the bet on Tesla's AI and autonomous ambitions for the future trumps short-term pain stemming from its slowing automotive business (which still accounts for 90% of Tesla's revenue). Institutional investors are taking profits, or booking losses, on their Tesla positions. Per tracking by fintech alternative data provider Quiver Quantitative (as first noted by Stocktwits ), numerous funds have been selling Tesla stock. Per filings as of the end of the fourth quarter, UBS Asset Management cut its Tesla stake by about 59 million shares in the quarter to just over 20 million total shares, a reduction of roughly 74%, leaving its stake at $9.1 billion. Nomura Holdings reduced its position by more than 80%, selling nearly 5 million shares, leaving it with about 1.2 million shares worth $545 million. Goldman also cut its stake by more than 2.4 million shares, though it remains one of Tesla’s larger institutional holders, with more than 27 million shares worth around $12.2 billion. Morgan Stanley reduced its exposure for a third consecutive quarter, per Quiver, ending the year with about 35.8 million shares, which were worth around $16.1 billion at the end of the quarter.

Per JPMorgan data, retail investors bought $326 million in Tesla stock during the week of Feb. 12-18, behind only Nvidia ( NVDA ), Amazon ( AMZN ), and Microsoft ( MSFT ). \"Despite a sentiment overhang tied to ambitious capex plans — dampening an otherwise solid earnings season and prompting some to find refuge away from AI themes, retail investors remained firm in their stock allocation, adding to NVDA, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, SNDK and MU this week,\" JPMorgan's Arun Jain wrote in a note published on Wednesday. Jain noted that \"Magnificent Seven\" companies still account for the majority of retail investors' purchases year to date, with Tesla second only to Microsoft, followed by Nvidia, Amazon, and Netflix ( NFLX ).

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) · Associated Press Finance · ASSOCIATED PRESS KEN SWEET Sat, February 21, 2026 at 2:58 PM CST 4 min read JPM NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase acknowledged for the first time that it closed the bank accounts of President Donald Trump and several of his businesses in the political and legal aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021 attacks on the U.S. Capitol, the latest development in a legal saga between the president and the nation's biggest bank over the issue known as “debanking.” The acknowledgment came in a court filing submitted this week in Trump's lawsuit against the bank and its leader, Jamie Dimon . The president sued for $5 billion , alleging that his accounts were closed for political reasons, disrupting his business operations. “In February 2021, JPMorgan informed Plaintiffs that certain accounts maintained with JPMorgan’s CB and PB would be closed,” JPMorgan's former chief administrative officer Dan Wilkening wrote in the court filing. The “PB” and “CB” stands for JPMorgan's private bank and commercial bank. Until now, JPMorgan has never admitted it closed the president's accounts in writing after Jan. 6. The bank would only speak hypothetically about when the bank closes accounts and its reasons for closing accounts, citing bank privacy laws. A spokeswoman for the bank declined to comment beyond what the bank said in its legal filings. Trump originally sued JPMorgan in Florida state court, where Trump's primary residence is now located. The filings this week are part of an effort by JPMorgan Chase to have the case both moved from state to federal court and to have the jurisdiction of the case moved to New York, which is where the bank accounts were located and where Trump kept much of his business operations until recently. Trump originally accused the bank of trade libel and violating state and federal unfair and deceptive trade practices. In the original lawsuit, Trump said he tried to raise the issue personally with Dimon after the bank sent him notices that JPMorgan would close his accounts, and that Dimon assured Trump he would figure out what was happening. The lawsuit alleges Dimon failed to follow up with Trump. Further, Trump’s lawyers allege that JPMorgan placed the president and his companies on a reputational “blacklist” that both JPMorgan and other banks use to keep clients from opening accounts with them in the future. The blacklist has yet to be defined by the president's lawyers. “If and when Plaintiffs explain what they mean by this “blacklist,” JPMorgan will respond accordingly,” the bank's lawyers said in a filing. JPMorgan has previously said that while it regrets that Trump felt the need to sue the bank, the lawsuit has no merit. Story Continues The issue of debanking is at the center of the case. Debanking occurs when a bank closes the accounts of a customer or refuses to do business with a customer in the form of loans or other services. Once a relatively obscure issue in finance, debanking has become a politically charged issue in recent years, with conservative politicians arguing that banks have discriminated against them and their affiliated interests. “In a devastating concession that proves President Trump’s entire claim, JPMorgan Chase admitted to unlawfully and intentionally de-banking President Trump, his family, and his businesses, causing overwhelming financial harm,” the president's lawyers said in a statement. President Trump is standing up for all those wrongly debanked by JPMorgan Chase and its cohorts, and will see this case to a just and proper conclusion.” Debanking first became a national issue when conservatives accused the Obama administration of pressuring banks to stop extending services to gun stores and payday lenders under “Operation Choke Point.” Trump and other conservative figures have alleged that banks cut them off from their accounts under the umbrella term of “reputational risk” after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Since Trump came back into office, the president’s banking regulators have moved to stop any banks from using “reputational risk” as a reason for denying service to customers. This is not the first lawsuit Trump has filed against a big bank alleging that he was debanked. The Trump Organization sued credit card giant Capital One in March 2025 for similar reasons and allegations. The case is ongoing. Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard More Info",

More Economic Analysis: Ernst & Young drops blunt reality check on the economy Federal Reserve official blasts latest interest-rate pause IMF drops blunt warning on US economy The initial deal was valued at $1.4 billion, with $550 million in performance-based equity . Since KKR acquired Arctos, it has gained immediate access to a “sticky” sector with strong global demand and long-term value. Arcto’s strategy is to leverage its sports-specific knowledge alongside GP solutions to plug into KKR’s global distribution machine. In 2025, secondary volume hit a record $226B , according to Evercore-reported data. Limited Partners (LPs) and managers don’t want to wait for IPO windows and are looking for ways to exit and secure liquidity amid cash-strapped conditions. If the market sentiment holds to GP-led activity and more secondaries, KKR wants a larger seat. The structure of the deal is designed to maintain the Arctos team: Initial Transaction of $1.4 billion (equity subject to vesting 2033) $300 million cash Additional $550 million in future equity Rest: KKR equity with long vesting timelines The Arctos Track Record, Financials, & Insider Buys Arctos was founded in 2019 by Doc O’Connor and Ian Charles , and it grew to manage $15 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM). Related: Private Equity Has Fallen Out of Favor with Some Institutional Investors Following the acquisition announcement, recent SEC Form 4 filings show that Co-CEOs Scott Nuttall and Joseph Bae , and Director Timothy Barakett , have been active buyers of KKR stock. As of mid-February 2026, Nuttall and Bae purchased hundreds of thousands of shares respectively at prices ranging from $100 to $103, signaling strong confidence. Story Continues In mid-February 2026 alone, Nuttall and Bae purchased hundreds of thousands of shares at prices ranging from $100 to $103 , signaling strong internal confidence in the firm’s post-acquisition trajectory.

The deal is expected to be accretive to KKR’s earnings per share (EPS) . More importantly, it moves KKR’s AUM mix . After the close, long-dated capital & perpetual will represent over half, 53% of KKR’s overall $759B AUM . The NFL, out of all the leagues, remains the most strict, with rules like a 10% cap for private equity ownership and requiring investors to remain strictly \"passive\" with no voting rights or control within operations. Jodi Balsam , a Professor of Sports Law at Brooklyn Law School and former NFL Counsel for Operations and Litigation , notes that while the legal structure enforces passivity, the reality of names like KKR’s scale carries weight. KKR's acquisition of Arctos provides the PE giant with access to a safe, exclusive asset class without disrupting the intricate nature of the NFL’s ownership structure. The ‘ passive ’ label remains both the NFL's & legal standards, and KKR’s institutional expertise, and other private equity entity rules were initially why the league relaxed its rules on private equity in the first place. KKR’s absorption of Arctos isn’t automatic, as the NFL possesses absolute discretion to vet new PE entities, retaining a “veto power” over KKR substitution for Arctos, and any new institutional partner for that matter, to ensure the league’s intense ownership standards are met. As Balsam noted, this relationship with private equity may not be malignant, but rather a natural evolution for franchises facing tax consequences and succession hurdles for teams mostly owned by billionaire families.

These strategic initiatives aim to drive both retail crypto onboarding and corporate developer adoption. SBI Offers $64 Million Bond With XRP Rewards On February 20, SBI revealed a 10 billion yen ($64.5 million) blockchain-based security token bond offering that rewards retail investors with XRP. The three-year debt instrument, branded as SBI START Bonds, officially prices on March 10 and issues on March 24. It promises conventional fixed-income investors an indicative annual interest rate between 1.85% and 2.45%. \"The SBI Group believes that the continued development of the ST bond market in Japan will contribute to the revitalization of the capital markets and, ultimately, to the sustainable growth of the real economy,\" it stated. However, the XRP rewards serve a much deeper purpose than simple yield enhancement. To qualify for the cryptocurrency payouts, which are distributed annually through 2029, domestic investors must open and verify an account with SBI VC Trade, the firm’s cryptocurrency brokerage subsidiary, by May 11. By mandating this crucial step, SBI implements a highly efficient customer-acquisition strategy. The firm uses a safe, regulated, yen-denominated corporate bond to funnel conservative retail money into its digital asset platform. Once these users enter the ecosystem, SBI can aggressively cross-sell them spot trading, staking, and margin services. SBI to Support XRPL-Focused Startups Through New Partnership Simultaneously, SBI Ripple Asia signed a memorandum of understanding with the Asia Web3 Alliance Japan (AWAJ). The partners aim to establish a specialized venture studio model that provides hands-on technical and regulatory support to regional startups. \"In this initiative, the two companies will work together to provide technical support as 'technical support partners' to businesses aiming to implement financial services using blockchain,\" the firms stated. Crucially, the initiative expressly requires these startups to build their financial services natively on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Unlike rival networks such as Ethereum or Solana, which boast organic developer momentum and robust smart contract activity, XRPL lacks a thriving decentralized finance ecosystem. However, the blockchain network has recently introduced several new features designed to attract institutional interest. By funding a venture studio explicitly tied to the ledger, SBI essentially attempts to further fuel developer momentum on the blockchain network. Story Continues The firm recognizes that without startups actively building on the chain, the network will remain underutilized for complex financial applications. \"Through our collaboration, we will support the creation of practical use cases utilizing XRPL that contribute to the financial and industrial sectors, aiming to realize globally applicable financial use cases originating in Japan,\" they explained.

One member of Congress bought no new stocks in 2025, only disclosing several sales. The congressman is back in 2026 with the first disclosure being a stock he has often sold. Congressman Discloses Nvidia Stock Sale Congressman Daniel Meuser (R-Pa.) bought no new stocks in 2025, only disclosing several sales of several Magnificent Seven and large-cap stocks already owned, as shown by the Benzinga Government Trades page. The congressman's newest disclosure shows his first transactions for 2026. Meuser sold $1,000 to $15,000 in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) stock on Jan. 14 and sold $1,000 to $15,000 in Nvidia stock on Jan. 30.

The congressman previously disclosed multiple trades made in February 2025 in August 2025, potentially violating the STOCK Act. According to data from Quiver Quantitative, Meuser sold $580,000 in stock in 2025 with no buys. The congressman bought $1.13 million in stock in 2024 with $1.94 million in sales during that year. The latest trades are disclosed as being made by a spouse, which means the congressman may not have known about the selling of Nvidia shares. A quick look at Meuser's trading history shows multiple Nvidia stock transactions. Trending: Blue-chip art has historically outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, and fractional investing is now opening this institutional asset class to everyday investors. Meuser's Nvidia Stock Trading History The congressman has been selling Nvidia stock each year since 2022. This means Meuser has been taking profits different times in one of the largest companies in the world, but also potentially missing out on further gains from a stock that is up over 1,150% inv the last five years. Here are the sales by Meuser, outside of the two recent trades, and the highest stock price for Nvidia shares on that day: Feb. 11, 2025: Sold $250,000 to $500,000 in NVDA stock, $134.48 daily high Oct. 1, 2024: Sold $500,000 to $1,000,000 in NVDA stock, $122.24 Aug. 7, 2024: Sold $250,000 to $500,000 in NVDA stock, $108.80 Feb. 20, 2024: Sold $15,000 to $50,000 in NVDA stock, $71.96 Aug. 14, 2023: Sold $15,000 to $50,000 in NVDA stock, $43.80 Aug. 14, 2023: Sold $100,000 to $250,000 in NVDA stock, $43.80 Aug. 14, 2023: Sold $15,000 to $50,000 in NVDA stock, $43.80 May 31, 2023: Sold $250,000 to $500,000 in NVDA stock, $40.29 May 5, 2023: Sold 1,000 to $15,000 in NVDA stock, $28.75 Jan. 21, 2022: Sold $100,000 to $250,000 in NVDA stock, $25.58 Jan. 21, 2022: Sold $1,000 to $15,000 in NVDA stock, $25.58 Jan. 21, 2022: Sold $1,000 to $15,000 in NVDA stock, $25.58 Story Continues In total, Meuser has sold over $1 million in Nvidia stock over the last four years.

      "content": "Redwire Director Sells 1.4M Shares For $14M Adé Hennis, The Motley Fool Sat, February 21, 2026 at 4:44 PM CST 3 min read RDW Red Holdings, LLC AE, a Director of Redwire Corporation (NYSE:RDW) , reported the indirect sale of 1,435,492 shares of Common Stock for approximately $14.49 million across multiple transactions on Feb. 9 and Feb. 10, 2026, according to a SEC Form 4 filing . Transaction summary Metric Value Shares sold (indirect) 1,435,492 Transaction value $14.5 million Post-transaction shares (indirect) 45,094,000 Transaction value based on SEC Form 4 weighted average purchase price ($10.10). Key questions What proportion of Red Holdings, LLC AE’s total holdings in Redwire Corporation was impacted by this sale? This sale represented 3.09% of indirect holdings in Common Stock, leaving indirect ownership of 45,094,000 shares post-transaction. Were these shares sold from direct or indirect holdings, and what entities are involved? All shares sold were held indirectly via entities including AE Red Holdings, LLC, and Edge Autonomy Ultimate Holdings, LP, as detailed in SEC footnotes. Company overview Metric Value Revenue (TTM) $296.15 million Net income (TTM) -268.03 million Employees 750 1-year price change (as of Feb. 21, 2026) -63.21% Company snapshot Redwire Corporation develops and manufactures mission-critical space infrastructure at scale within the aerospace and defense sector. Products it offers include antennas, advanced sensors, solar arrays, composite booms, payload adapters, and software for digital engineering and simulation. It has a global commercial customer base, including in the U.S. and Europe. What this transaction means for investors This set of sales follows AE Red Holdings’ sale of $3,368,903 in shares between Feb. 3 and 4, 2026, at an average price of $11.18, for a total value of $37.66 million. All of these sales were executed by managing members Michael Greene and David H. Rowe. The sales came at a rather interesting time because Redwire’s share prices climbed approximately 50% in January 2026, the highest price gain in a month for the stock since November 2024. However, as of Feb. 21, the stock has essentially lost all of that return, as the price has fallen back. In less than four days, Redwire will have its fourth-quarter earnings report for FY 2025. The company is on pace to close FY 2026 with its worst annual net loss, having already lost $208.25 million in net income, nearly double the previous year’s.

      "content": "The 1 Stock I'd Buy Before American Express Right Now Daniel Foelber, The Motley Fool Sat, February 21, 2026 at 4:39 PM CST 4 min read AXP V ^GSPC NVDA INTC American Express (NYSE: AXP) is up 160.4% in the last five years compared to a 73.7% gain in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) . Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » American Express remains a solid buy, but Visa (NYSE: V) is even more compelling. Visa's high-margin business model Visa is a pure-play payment processor that isn't responsible for the credit risk of the cards on its network. Rather, it partners with financial services companies and banks . For example, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) issues and bears the credit risk of the popular Chase Sapphire cards, while Visa's network connects merchants to Chase to approve transactions. Image source: Visa. American Express is both the payment processor and card issuer -- making it an inherently riskier investment than Visa. But American Express has an exceptional track record of managing risk. Its cards have relatively high annual fees. And it attracts affluent customers with generous rewards programs. These rewards programs are expensive, and they are among the highest costs for American Express. By comparison, Visa doesn't have to worry about those costs -- because again, it isn't issuing the cards. As a result, Visa is a capital-light, ultra-high-margin business. Expenses cover labor, cybersecurity, network management, and marketing. But it doesn't have to invest a lot of capital to make money, which is a big advantage compared to capital-intensive companies. Because Visa has such high margins and has historically generated consistent growth, it has commanded a higher valuation than American Express. But American Express has outperformed the S&P 500 for five consecutive years, whereas Visa is down 11.2% over the last year. Visa is currently trading at a discount to its five-year median price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-free-cash-flow (FCF) ratios, while American Express is trading at a premium. V PE Ratio (5y Median) data by YCharts Caps on credit card interest rates Visa, Mastercard (NYSE: MA) , and American Express are down between 8.8% and 10.4% year to date, even though the S&P 500 is roughly flat. Consumer spending concerns and a proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates may be spooking some investors. The 10% cap concerns are arguably overblown because if that were to go into effect, lenders would limit credit access for consumers with lower credit scores -- which could lead to increased use of payday loans and other higher-interest options. Story Continues Payment processors generate high margins largely because the fees they collect on transaction volume and frequency are so high. A cap between 10% and the more common 20%+ annual percentage rate would impact issuer margins -- like JPMorgan Chase and American Express -- but not Visa or Mastercard directly. However, it would indirectly impact these companies because their networks would shrink, and transaction volume and frequency would fall. Visa is one of the best stocks to buy now Visa is better positioned to handle economic uncertainty and industry policy changes than American Express. The recent sell-off makes its valuation very compelling. American Express has a slightly higher dividend yield at 1% compared to 0.9% for Visa. Both companies regularly buy back stock and have drastically reduced their share counts over time -- which has accelerated earnings growth. Visa is a high-margin cash cow of a business, with international exposure and a rock-solid balance sheet. It is the undisputed industry leader and is frequently cited as being the most accepted card brand worldwide, with the most credit and debit cards in circulation. Companies as high quality as Visa rarely go on sale. But right now, investors can buy Visa at a multi-year low valuation. All told, Visa is the kind of stock that will appeal to dividend, value, and growth stock investors alike, making it a foundational holding worthy of building a portfolio around in 2026. Should you buy stock in Visa right now? Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

      "content": "History Says Now Is the Time to Buy These 2 Brilliant Stocks Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool Sat, February 21, 2026 at 4:39 PM CST 4 min read NVDA MSFT The market seldom provides great buying opportunities for some of the best companies on the planet. However, with the latest round of tech sell-offs, that's exactly where we find ourselves. Two of the most dominant stocks in the market over the past few years are on sale at historically cheap levels, and if you swoop in to buy shares now, you'll be set to make a massive return. Two stocks that I'm eyeing are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) . Each of these stocks has reached relatively affordable levels, and now is the time to load up on shares. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks » Image source: Getty Images. The last time the stocks were this cheap, they soared in the following months The first part of this analysis is to select a valuation metric. In my opinion, the price-to- forward earnings ratio is the best measure, as it allows investors to value the company on where it's going rather than where it was. This is critical in a rapidly shifting artificial intelligence-powered landscape, as companies are spending billions of dollars on computing equipment to pursue AI as hard as they can. Earnings a company produces over the past 12 months may be a more concrete way to value a business, but investors are doing themselves a disservice by not valuing the company based on forward earnings because that's what the rest of the market is doing. The market is a forward-looking machine, so that's the metric we should use. From that standpoint, both Nvidia and Microsoft are valued at recently cheap levels. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts Microsoft is now cheaper than it ever has been since 2023 -- even lower than the depths of the tariff sell-off in April 2025. Nvidia is in a similar boat, trading at levels not seen since April 2025 and the depths of the tech sell-off in 2023. Both of these times ended up being incredible buying opportunities for the stocks, and I think right now could also be just as good. AI spending will push these two higher Nvidia is a primary beneficiary of all of the AI spending that has been announced. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the primary computing units utilized in AI model training and inference. With each new data center that's built, Nvidia is likely to capture a huge sale. Furthermore, Nvidia is allowed to start exporting GPUs to China again, which could lead to a huge boost this year. Wall Street analysts project 65% growth in fiscal year (FY) 2027 (ending January 2027), showcasing that they expect another banner year for Nvidia. Story Continues Microsoft isn't growing nearly as fast as Nvidia, and it's also spending a boatload of money on AI computing capacity. However, that's because the demand is there. Its cloud computing platform, Azure, is rapidly growing, rising 39% year over year in Q2 FY 2025 (ending Dec. 31). Cloud computing is how several AI companies are powering their workloads, as they don't have the capital necessary to build a data center themselves, so it makes more sense to rent it from a provider like Microsoft. This spending will help push Microsoft stock to new heights, but AI feature integration within Microsoft's core software suite is another source of growth. While the market growth may be somewhat fatigued by AI spending, the reality is that it's still going to happen. The recent sell-off in tech stocks is a gift to investors of all varieties, and you can get a one-two punch of high growth and resilience by purchasing shares of Nvidia and Microsoft right now. I can think of few better buys in the stock market than this duo, and investors who have missed out on the impressive runs these stocks have been on over the past few years can remedy that mistake by buying them today. Should you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Net income from continuing operations dropped 21% to $242 million and reported EPS fell to $0.34 from $0.40, largely reflecting the absence of an $87 million gain from REA Group’s sale of PropertyGuru that boosted results last year, along with a $16 million one-time inventory write-off at HarperCollins’ international operations.

The 6–3 majority held that IEEPA does not empower the executive branch to impose tariffs without explicit congressional authorization, effectively invalidating much of the tariff regime imposed on imports from China, Mexico, Canada and other trading partners. The decision, handed down in Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump and V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. Trump , represents a significant judicial check on presidential unilateral trade authority. Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, emphasized that tariff power historically resides with Congress under Article I of the Constitution and that vague language in emergency statutes cannot substitute for that authority.

Stop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now! Justice Brett Kavanaugh, dissenting, specifically expressed concerns about what this means for the future of the country. He specifically wrote that “...the interim effects of the Court’s decision could be substantial. The United States may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers…even though some importers may have already passed on costs to consumers.” This highlights an important inequity: consumers paid billions of dollars, but corporations will get the refund windfall. He further contested under the idea that the refund process is likely to be a “mess” and “the IEEPA tariffs have helped facilitate trade deals worth trillions of dollars,” adding that this ruling will “generate uncertainty” around those deals. For markets and investors, the ruling introduces a mix of clarity and uncertainty. Major indexes saw modest, but positive, initial reactions, with the S&P 500 ($SPX) up 0.3%, and Nasdaq ($NASX) up 0.5%, drifting modestly higher even as the Dow ($DOWI) slipped slightly before rebounding, suggesting that many institutional investors had priced in at least the possibility of such an outcome. Treasury yields were steady, reflecting continued caution amid mixed macroeconomic data. Story Continues Tariff Revenue and Legal Limbo Central to the economic implications is the fate of hundreds of billions in tariff revenue collected under the struck-down policies. In the 2025 fiscal year alone, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported roughly $133.5 billion in duties collected under the emergency tariff regime, accounting for a majority of the roughly $200 billion total tariff revenue that year. Legal experts and trade lawyers immediately flagged refund claims as the next major legal battleground, with lower courts expected to determine whether importers are entitled to claw back monies paid under tariffs now deemed unauthorized. Those funds had at times been touted by the administration as potential ammunition for deficit reduction, direct rebates, or sectoral support programs. With the legal foundation invalidated, federal budget planners face a new set of pressures, particularly if courts eventually mandate refunds on past tariff payments. Sector and Corporate Impact From an investing perspective, the ruling recalibrates risk and opportunity across a range of industries. Retailers, consumer goods companies and import-dependent sectors had been squeezed by heightened duties, a cost frequently passed along to consumers. With the legal basis for such tariffs dismantled, cost structures for companies reliant on imported components may ease, potentially boosting margins if supply costs fall as duties unwind. Analysts tracking recent tariff-induced price “tax effects” noted that a significant portion of tariff costs were borne by U.S. importers and consumers, not foreign producers, meaning relief here could translate directly into improved margins or pricing flexibility. Industrial and materials plays tied to domestic substitutes for previously tariffed goods could experience volatility. Companies that had pivoted capacity or supply chains to domestic producers on the assumption of a prolonged tariff environment may need to reassess those strategic investments. Conversely, sectors that had suffered from higher import costs — including apparel, electronics components, and auto parts — may see competitive conditions normalize. International Trade and Diplomatic Fallout The ruling also has geopolitical and trade ramifications. Many of the tariffs struck down were framed as “reciprocal” duties aimed at addressing trade imbalances or alleged unfair practices by major trading partners. With those measures invalidated, the U.S. must engage allies and rivals through formal trade negotiations or pursue tariffs under statutes for which Congress has clearer delegation authority, such as Section 301 of the Trade Act or Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. Foreign markets reacted with a mixture of relief and caution. European and Asian exchanges exhibited mixed trading patterns, reflecting uncertainty about future U.S. trade policy direction. A key question for global investors is how rapidly a new, congressionally authorized trade framework might emerge and whether it will be more predictable than the unilateral regime now struck down. Policy and Legislative Outlook The Court’s decision is likely to embolden legislative efforts to clarify tariff-setting authority and oversight. Bipartisan proposals in Congress, such as the Trade Review Act, seek to reassert congressional control over tariff decisions, requiring notification and approval for significant new duties. Such legislative efforts could create a more stable and transparent trade policy environment, a positive signal for longer-term capital allocation decisions. What Investors Should Watch Next Over the coming weeks and months, market attention will likely focus on several key developments: Refund litigation: How lower courts handle claims from importers seeking repayment of duties paid under the invalidated regime. New tariff authorities: Whether Congress passes new legislation to grant clearer trade powers to the executive branch or establish joint congressional oversight. Sector rotation: Performance differentials between import-dependent sectors and those that benefited from tariff protection. Macro impact: Whether reduced tariff uncertainty moderates inflationary pressures and influences Federal Reserve policy on interest rates. In the short term, the markets appear to view the Supreme Court’s action as a correction rather than a crisis. Over the longer horizon, clarity around trade authority and tariff policy could unlock capital previously held back by regulatory uncertainty and open fresh opportunities in sectors sensitive to import cost structures.

To find the latest Stock Market Today threads, click here . Happy Friday. This is TheStreet’s Stock Market Today for Feb. 20, 2026. You can follow the latest updates on the market here in our daily live blog. Update: 4:00 p.m. ET Closing Bell The U.S. markets are now closed for the week. Here's how we closed it out: Nasdaq: +0.90% S&P 500 : +0.69% Dow : +0.47% Russell 2000 : +0.00% Update: 2:54 p.m. ET Cybersecurity Stocks Fall After New Anthropic Feature Launched After Anthropic announced a new \"cybersecurity\" feature, Claude Code Security, shares of major cybersecurity stocks faced a selloff. The new feature promises to scan codebases \"for vulnerabilities and suggests targeted software patches for human review,\" per a post on X. The result is that the Global X Cybersecurity ETF ($ BUG ) is down over 4% today, with the ETF's largest holdings facing a selloff which can be likened to the recent AI antics in software, legal, and even logistics. Update: 2:27 p.m. ET Refunds when? Not anytime soon Now that President Donald Trump has imposed fresh tariffs under a different section of the law book, there's one big question that remains: how will everybody get their money back? Businesses that paid into the IEEPA tariffs struck down this morning should be entitled to a refund. In today's TheStreet Daily segment, we tackled the big question, including why the answer won't be \"soon.\" Update: 1:44 p.m. ET Brief tariff reprieve ends with new 10% tariff Wall Street cheered to the end of President Donald Trump's IEEPA tariffs, but just a few short hours later, the President is putting the U.S. back on the Tariff Train by announcing a new 10% global tariff. The new Section 122 tariff will be in effect for 150 days, using different authorities than the emergency powers utilized by the President in his first act in the Rose Garden. After that point, they will need to be renewed by Congress. That might be a difficult ask as the midterm elections loom heavy. It's more likely, for these reasons, that these tariffs will not be disputed given they have clear and set terms, including an end date. After rising before the press conference, stocks were little moved on the news. Update: 1:18 p.m. ET Midday Movers Into midday, the Nasdaq (+0.53%) is still leading the way among major indexes. The S&P 500 (+0.32%) is trailing, while the Dow (-0.03%) and Russell 2000 (-0.38%) are declining. With that, we can turn our attention to our Midday Movers to see the stories emerging in individual stocks. Story Continues Winners Losers Grail (-49.4%) nearly halved today after its cancer detection test failed in a UK study, introducing fresh questions about the business's future. It's joined by Dnow (-20.4%) and Chemours Company (-19.4%) to round out the top three. Also notable: Figure Technology Solutions (-10.2%) is down after experiencing a catastrophic data breach. Update: 10:16 a.m. ET Supreme Court strikes IEEPA tariffs After a month-long wait, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump's far-reaching emergency power tariffs. The highest court in the land argued that the International Emergency Economic Power Acts, the law under which the tariffs were created, \"does not authorize the President to impose tariffs.\" The decision will affect many of Trump's reciprocal tariffs which were imposed in April of last year, while other industry-specific tariffs which were imposed under a section act (Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962) will stand. Over the next few days, much attention will be paid to how the President will move to impose similar tariffs. In a press conference after the tariffs were struck, Trump said that he had \"a plan\", while calling the decision \"a disgrace.\" He had previously said that ending the tariffs would At the same time, businesses will also be lining up for refunds on the so-called reciprocal tariffs. There's much to be decided still about the when, where, and how of those refunds. The Reaction The news has helped push stocks, which started the session down by a few basis points, into the green. 58.3% (3,240) issues are advancing against 2,060 (37.1%) in decline. The Nasdaq (+0.57%) and S&P 500 (+0.40%) are hitting day highs, joined by the Dow (+0.29%). The Russell 2000 (+0.31%), meanwhile, seems to have popped and pulled back. Here is the S&P 500 heat map (15 min delayed): Update: 9:30 - 10:00 a.m. ET Opening Bell: Data & Earnings Good morning. The U.S. stock market is now open for the day. For the moment, U.S. equities are trading to the downside, likely a product of We'll round back in about 30 minutes for an update. In the meantime, let's dig into the swath of economic data which just dropped: S&P Global Composite Is Out The S&P Global Composite PMI Flash for February is out now, dropping to 52.3 (from 53). Decliners were also seen in the Global Manufacturing PMI Flash (down to 51.2 from 52.4) and Global Services PMI Flash (down to 52.3 from 52.7). Both results were below analysts' expectations. Michigan Consumer Confidence Rises The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Final for February came in little-moved at 56.6 (up from 56.4 last month), missing expectations which were closer to the index's preliminary February reading of 57.3. A.M. Earnings: AngloGold, PPL Corp, Lamar Friday is generally a slow day for earnings; they're even more in the margins today with all of the reports that are dropping. Per FinViz, there are a little more than a dozen reports today. Here they are: Update: 8:31 a.m. ET GDP Comes In Light, PCE Shows Signs of Acceleration Good morning. U.S. equity futures are tilted to the downside this morning after the GDP Growth Rate Adv decelerated significantly quarter-over-quarter. In the fourth quarter, GDP grew just 1.4%, while the consensus was closer to 3%. The month-long government shutdown likely had a lot to do with this readout. At the same time, Core PCE advanced 0.4% month-over-month in December, up from 0.2% in November. The combination of slowing GDP and price acceleration is unlikely to be a welcome sight.

Volatility is rising -- the VIX has risen by over 43% since the beginning of the year -- with investors waiting to see what happens in Iran. To make matters worse, the Commerce Department reported this morning that America’s GDP in the fourth quarter increased by 1.4%, 300 and 240 basis points lower than Q3 2025 and Q2 2025, respectively. More News from Barchart 21,000 Reasons Cogent Communications’ Unusual Options Activity Screams Bull Call Spread How to Find the Best Stocks for This Cash-Generating Options Strategy 3 Steps to a Simple Trading System Markets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines. Add to this a 3.0% annualized increase in core prices in December, which excludes food and energy, and it’s becoming abundantly clear that tariffs are having some effect on prices, as companies can no longer avoid passing on the extra cost.  A war in Iran would most certainly lead to higher gas prices, exacerbating an already sticky inflation rate. Who knows what this means for the stock market? It seems to have a mind of its own. In yesterday’s unusual options activity, three stocks with big gains over the past 12 months had call and put options with Vol/OI (volume-to-open-interest) ratios above 7.0. If you bought them a year ago or earlier, you might want to consider implementing a Protective Collar options strategy. Here's why. Have an excellent weekend. What Is a Protective Collar Strategy? As the name suggests, you are creating a collar around your existing long stock position by selling a put with a strike price below the share price and buying a call with a strike price above it. By doing so, you’re providing downside protection for your shares, while capping the future upside. It’s an appropriate strategy when you’re unsure about the near-term direction of the stock price. Let’s go to the stocks themselves. All recognizable businesses, I would think. Caterpillar (CAT) Caterpillar’s (CAT) stock is up 118% over the past 12 months. Although it had two unusually active options yesterday, it is the Feb. 27 $820 strike that will form one part of the protective collar. Based on yesterday’s closing price, you’re capping the gains over the next week at 7.8%. The expected move is less than half that. So, now we must select a long put to protect on the downside—ideally, something ATM (at-the-money) or slightly OTM (out-of-the-money). Ultimately, you want to give yourself the best chance of making money over the next week while protecting against a significant price drop. Story Continues The odds of this happening are low. The expected move is 3.61% or $27.27 based on a share price of $765.36. So, you’ll want a put strike price of $740 or higher while keeping the cost of this protection reasonable. Based on the $740 put strike, the net debit or cost of the protective collar is $9.55 ($955), or $1.3% of the $755.76 share price. That’s more than reasonable, while giving the bet a 41.2% chance of making money. Your maximum profit here is more than double the maximum loss. If you paid $34,000 for 100 shares of CAT stock in February 2025 and the share price is $740 next Friday, your maximum loss is $2,531 [$740 put strike price -$755.76 share price - $9.55 net debit]. If the share price is $728.49 at expiration [$755.76 share price - $27.27 expected move], you still are only out $2,531. However, net-net, you’re still up about 114% from a year ago. Wayfair (W) The $55 put combined with the $92.50 call could be a ready-made protective collar for Wayfair (W) bulls. The DTE (days to expiration) of 29 days is much better than Caterpillar’s DTE. Generally, 30-90 days is better because it balances downside protection with a reasonable cost. Wayfair’s stock is up 73% over the past 12 months. That said, it’s given back 34% since hitting a 52-week high of $119.98 in mid-January. Yesterday, it lost 13% after reporting poor Q4 2025 results. As I write this late morning Friday, it’s gained some of that back. I’ve never liked Wayfair’s business. It struggles to make money consistently -- the company reported an EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) profit of $743 million on $12.46 billion in revenue in 2025 -- and now it wants to go on the offensive to take market share and grow the top line. Investors are right to be concerned. If you bought W stock last February at $41, you’re probably wishing you’d put a protective collar in place in January. Hindsight is 20/20. But it’s not too late to do so. As you see above, the short $92.50 call combined with the long $55 put has a net credit of $2.15 ($215) or 2.5% of its share price. While the net credit is tempting, if you bought a year ago, you don’t want your profits to evaporate over the next month after what’s already taken place since mid-January. So, I would go for a put strike price of $70 or higher. When you think about it, the $77.50 put’s net debit of $2.55 isn’t a high price to pay to stem the bleeding. In mid-January, based on a $41 purchase price, you were up 193% at the 52-week high of $119.98. You’re now up 107%. If it were me, I’d be reluctant to let those gains fall below triple digits, especially given that W stock spent the better part of 3 years trading in the $40s before taking flight last April. Protection costs. There’s no way around it. Southwest Airlines (LUV) Of the five unusually active options yesterday, I’m focused on the $57.50 call and $50 put expiring in June. The risk with such a long DTE is that you could miss out on significant appreciation. The expected move over the next 119 days is $9.14 (17.64%), which puts the upper share price at $61.22. If you bought Southwest Airlines (LUV) stock a year ago at $30, that’s about double over 16 months. That’s not insignificant. Not to mention, the Wall Street mean target price for Southwest’s stock is $48.07, below its current share price, so it’s not inconceivable that the shares drop $9.14 over the next 119 days rather than rise. Based on the above, the $1.15 net debit is a reasonable 2.2% of the share price. Your maximum loss of $2.96 is just 5.7% of the current share price. So, even if you did hit your maximum loss, if you bought a year ago at $30, you’d still be up 63%. Now, if you believe in letting your winners run, and the airline is making major changes to how it operates, you might be reluctant to cap your upside. “‘Our detailed work suggests potential for upside to LUV’s previous targets on extra legroom and assigned seating,’ analysts led by Atul Maheswari wrote. ‘Other initiatives such as checked bag fees, increased share of corporate travel, and loyalty enhancements, among others should also drive strong earnings accretion over the next couple of years,’” Barron’s reported the analyst’s recent comments. As they say, execution is everything. Southwest hasn’t operated at maximum efficiency for several years. I’m skeptical they can match a well-run airline like Delta Air Lines (DAL). I guess we’ll find out soon enough. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "content": "Gold holds above $5,000 as Trump's blanket tariffs get struck down, Iran-US tensions in play Ines Ferré · Senior Business Reporter Fri, February 20, 2026 at 2:12 PM EST 1 min read GC=F Gold ( GC=F ) topped $5,000 on Friday after the Supreme Court struck down President Trump's most sweeping tariffs and Wall Street highlighted its bullish call on the precious metal. Gold rose nearly 2%, on pace for a weekly gain, even as President Trump announced a 10% global tariff following the high court's ruling. More from Yahoo Scout What geopolitical factors are supporting gold demand? How high could gold prices reach by 2026? Why are analysts bullish on gold's outlook? What drove gold prices to top $5,000 recently? Geopolitical hedging, concerns about currency debasement, and expectations of Fed policy easing have all contributed to the steady demand for bullion. Even with a significant drawdown at the end of last month, gold is up 16% since the start of January, following a historic gain last year. Goldman Sachs analysts maintain that while structural purchases from central banks have slowed recently, they expect them to reaccelerate, with demand also stemming from the private sector if the Federal Reserve cuts rates this year. \"Taken together, these two factors drive gold to slowly grind higher to $5,400/toz by end-2026,\" they said. Additional private-sector diversification over perceived fiscal risks in Western countries could send prices even higher, the analysts said.

The firm forecasts the precious metal could reach $6,200 per ounce in the coming months \"as the key drivers underpinning its strong rally remain in place.\" Oliver Helbig via Getty Images Ines Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

      "content": "Why Norwegian Cruise Line Is Sailing Higher This Week Josh Kohn-Lindquist, The Motley Fool Fri, February 20, 2026 at 1:44 PM EST 3 min read NCLH CCL RCL Shares of the fourth-largest cruise operator, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NYSE: NCLH) , are up 11% this week as of noon ET Friday. On Tuesday, activist investing firm Elliott Management announced it had built a 10% stake in the cruise line behemoth. Given Elliott Management's solid long-term track record led by founder Paul Singer, the market moved Norwegian's shares higher on optimism for a turnaround. Can Norwegian cruise to smoother seas? After Norwegian delivered annualized total returns of 13% from its IPO in 2013 through 2020 -- before plummeting amid the pandemic -- its stock has only generated total returns of 35% over the last three years. Meanwhile, peers Carnival Corp. and Royal Caribbean are up 181% and 333% over the same time. Due to these disappointing results -- and dismayed by the board's recent selection for a new Chief Executive Officer -- Elliott is stepping in to try and shake things up for the better. Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » Image source: Getty Images. Some of Norwegian's biggest issues that Elliott noted were: its once industry-leading EBITDA margins from 2013 are now middle of the pack among its peers at 36% unit-level cruise costs have jumped 44% since 2013, compared to just 30% for Royal Caribbean and 21% for Carnival SG&A expenses rose 248% since 2013, versus 125% for Royal and 81% for Carnival Norwegian not capitalizing on its private island, Great Stirrup Cay, as Royal did with Coco Cay wasteful spending and culture in general, focusing on unnecessary luxuries selecting an insider from its board for CEO, despite not having much cruise line experience Elliott hopes to overhaul the board, appoint new management, and rein in excessive spending to boost its EBITDA margin from 36% to 45% over time. Trading at just 9 times forward earnings, the market has Norwegian priced to go out of business, rather than as a stock operating in a cruise industry that has steadily become a more popular vacation option over time. This turnaround isn't necessarily my type of investment, but I'd imagine Elliott can only help, and the news makes the stock an intriguing watch going forward.

(NYSE: SNAP ) is among the 8 Most Promising Metaverse Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds . Arete Cites Higher-Margin Recurring Revenue as Catalyst for Snap Inc. (SNAP) Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) is one of the most promising stocks. TheFly reported on February 9 that Arete Research upgraded SNAP to Buy from Neutral and set a price target of $7.30. In support of the update, the firm pointed to a shifting revenue mix and pointed out that SNAP is shifting its focus from its smaller-scale advertising business to higher-margin, recurring subscription revenue. Analysts predict that this change will improve the company's financial standing over time. The company's more positive outlook on the stock is supported by its perception that downside risk is minimal at present share levels. More recently, it was reported on February 11 that Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) and claimed that the business had not warned users and parents enough about the app's addictive features and hazardous content. The complaint alleges that, in spite of its kid-safe marketing and \"12+\" rating in app stores, Snapchat ended up exposing kids to mature content like profanity, sexual material, and posts about drugs. The complaint also highlights features such as \"Snapstreaks\" and argues that daily-use incentives incite compulsive behavior among teens. Paxton accused the corporation of deceiving customers and stated that parents should be made aware of the dangers posed by the apps their kids use. The action comes after the Texas Attorney General filed similar allegations against Roblox (NYSE: RBLX) and TikTok, two other significant social media companies. Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) is an American tech company best known for Snapchat that is shaping the augmented reality (AR) metaverse by enabling digital overlays on the real world. It leads in AR lenses and tools, supports millions of creators, and is developing wearable AR “Specs” glasses to blend digital experiences with physical spaces. While we acknowledge the potential of SNAP as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

The CoreWeave logo displayed on a smartphone screen_ Image by Robert Way via Shutterstock_ Wajeeh Khan Fri, February 20, 2026 at 12:42 PM PST 2 min read CRWV OWL CoreWeave (CRWV) shares tanked over 10% this morning following reports that Blue Owl Capital has failed to secure the necessary $4 billion in debt financing for a massive data center project in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Investors bailed on CRWV mostly because it was slated to be the anchor tenant of this facility. The selloff on Feb. 20 even saw the Nasdaq-listed firm crash below its 20-day moving average (MA), indicating downward pressure may sustain in the near-term. More News from Barchart Oracle Stock Plunges 55%: Buy the Dip or Stay Away? Paul Tudor Jones Is Betting Big on Google Stock. Should You? Dear IonQ Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for February 25 Tired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now! Versus its year-to-date high, CoreWeave stock is now down more than 20%. www.barchart.com Is It Worth Buying CoreWeave Stock on the Pullback? According to media reports, at least one major lender passed on the aforementioned data center deal, citing concerns about CoreWeave’s B+ credit rating and the sustainability of its debt-heavy business model. This triggered fear among investors that the “easy money” used to fund AI expansion is drying up. In fact, such concerns even made Morgan Stanley analysts issue a cautious note on CRWV shares. Failure of data center projects to find debt financing creates a “significant valuation overhang” for the AI infrastructure firm, especially since it’s unlikely to turn a GAAP profit this year, they told clients. Morgan Stanley emphasized that CoreWeave’s massive backlog ($55 billion) is meaningless if the company can’t secure the billions required to actually build the servers to fulfill those orders. Senior Insider Recently Sold CRWV Shares Caution is warranted in buying CoreWeave shares on the pullback also because Brannin McBee, company’s chief development officer, unloaded more than 133,000 shares on Feb. 17. What this means is that even internal leadership is locking in gains this year instead of betting on long-term upside. For investors, it’s a signal that ongoing weakness in CRWV may be structural in nature. Investors should also note that the AI stock is now hovering around its 50-day MA at the $86 level. A decisive break below that price may accelerate bearish momentum in the near term. Moreover, CoreWeave is expected to report $0.61 a share of loss for its Q4 on Feb. 26, which makes it even less attractive as a long-term holding. What’s the Consensus Rating on CoreWeave? Other Wall Street firms, however, seem to disagree with Morgan Stanley’s cautious view on CRWV shares. Story Continues The consensus rating on CoreWeave sits at “Moderate Buy” currently with the mean target of about $122 indicating potential upside of roughly 40% from here. www.barchart.com On the date of publication, Wajeeh Khan did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "content": "Bitcoin Sell Pressure Is Easing, But Whales Keep Dumping on Exchanges: CryptoQuant Logan Hitchcock Fri, February 20, 2026 at 12:41 PM PST 2 min read BTC-USD A major influx of Bitcoin deposits to centralized exchanges has slowed, reducing sell pressure on crypto’s top asset by market cap. But the largest investors, or whales, have kept their foot on the gas, according to a new report from CryptoQuant. The Bitcoin deposited on exchanges had reached around 60,000 BTC on February 6 as the price of the coin slipped near $60,000. That number has since fallen to around 23,000 BTC on average over the last seven days, the blockchain analytics firm indicated. “This moderation suggests that the acute sell-off phase has eased, even as exchange flows remain elevated relative to prior months,” the report reads. “Lower exchange inflows put less selling pressure on prices.” While the inflows are declining from their early-month levels, their makeup has shifted to favor large depositors. CryptoQuant’s “Exchange Whale Ratio,” which compares the top 10 inflows to the entire influx of deposits, has reached 0.64—its highest mark since 2015. “This indicates that 64% of all Bitcoin exchange inflows were made by the top 10 by volume, suggesting that large investors are selling,” the firm wrote. Whales lining up to sell the top asset was a key theme of 2025, in which an “unprecedented amount” of coins changed hands, CryptoQuant analyst J.A. Maartun told Decrypt in December. “I call this the 'great redistribution,' during which Bitcoin held by long-term holders has been transferred to new owners in several waves,” Maartun said at the time. Bitcoin Is Down Bad, But Hasn't Yet Hit Its 'Ultimate Bear Market Bottom': Analysts BTC climbed to $126,080 in October, creating a new all-time high mark. But since that time, it’s fallen 46% to recently change hands at $67,582. A near-term jump might not be in the cards either. Previous analysis from CryptoQuant indicates the asset’s \"ultimate bear market bottom” is around $55,000, and its exchange analysis points to diminishing “dry powder” or USDT available to buy crypto assets. “Crypto price rallies are often accompanied by increasing stablecoin exchange deposits,” the firm wrote. Users on Myriad—a prediction market platform operated by Decrypt 's parent company, Dastan—agree that Bitcoin's next big move is down, currently penciling in a 57% chance that the price of BTC falls to $55,000 sooner than it can rebound to $84,000.

      "content": "Dollar Weakens as SCOTUS Rebuffs President Trump’s Tariffs Rich Asplund Fri, February 20, 2026 at 12:35 PM PST 7 min read DX-Y.NYB The dollar index (DXY00) fell from a 4-week high on Friday and finished down by -0.13%.  Weaker-than-expected US economic news knocked the dollar lower on Friday.  US Q4 GDP, the Feb S&P manufacturing PMI, and the University of Michigan US Feb consumer sentiment index all were weaker than expected and weighed on the dollar. The dollar fell to its low on Friday after the Supreme Court struck down President Trump’s global tariffs, as the removal of the tariff revenue will boost the US budget deficit. Losses in the dollar are limited after the Dec core PCE price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, rose more than expected, a hawkish factor for Fed policy.  Also, hawkish comments on Friday from Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic supported the dollar, as he said it’s prudent to keep interest rates mildly restrictive.

US Dec personal spending rose +0.4% m/m, stronger than expectations of +0.3% m/m.  Dec personal income rose +0.3% m/m, right on expectations. The US Dec core PCE price index (the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge) rose +0.4% m/m and +3.0% y/y, stronger than expectations of +0.3% m/m and +2.9% y/y. The US Feb S&P manufacturing PMI fell -1.2 to 51.2, weaker than expectations of no change at 52.4. US Dec new home sales fell by -1.7% to 645,000, better than expectations of 730,000. The University of Michigan US Feb consumer sentiment index was revised lower by -0.7 to 56.6, weaker than expectations of no change at 57.3. The University of Michigan US Feb 1-year inflation expectations were revised lower to a 13-month low of 3.4% from the previously reported 3.5%.  The Feb 5-10 year inflation expectations were revised lower to 3.3% from the previously reported 3.4%. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said it’s prudent to have interest rates mildly restrictive as he expects US growth in 2026 to put upward pressure on inflation. The US Supreme Court struck down President Trump’s sweeping global tariffs, saying he exceeded his authority by invoking a federal-emergency powers law to impose his “reciprocal” tariffs as well as targeted import taxes on countries to address fentanyl trafficking. Story continues After the Supreme Court’s ruling, President Trump said he would impose a 10% global tariff under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, over and above tariffs already being charged.  He declared all national security tariffs under Section 232 and existing Section 301 tariffs to be in full force and effect.  Section 122 tariffs last only 150 days, and Congress would need to approve any extension.  Section 301 tariffs require country-specific investigations that include hearings and an opportunity for input from companies or nations affected. Swaps markets are discounting the odds at 5% for a -25 bp rate cut at the next policy meeting on March 17-18. The dollar continues to see underlying weakness as the FOMC is expected to cut interest rates by about -50 bp in 2026, while the BOJ is expected to raise rates by another +25 bp in 2026, and the ECB is expected to leave rates unchanged in 2026. EUR/USD (^EURUSD) on Friday rose by +0.06%.  The euro posted modest gains on Friday amid the dollar’s weakness.  Also, Friday’s stronger-than-expected Eurozone Feb manufacturing PMI was supportive of the euro.  Gains in the euro were limited after German Jan producer prices fell more than expected, a dovish factor for ECB policy. Eurozone Feb S&P manufacturing PMI rose +1.3 to 50.8, stronger than expectations of 50.0 and the fastest pace of expansion in 3.5 years. German Jan PPI fell -3.0% y/y, weaker than expectations of -2.2% y/y and the steepest pace of decline in 1.75 years. Swaps are discounting a 2% chance of a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at its next policy meeting on March 19. USD/JPY (^USDJPY) on Friday rose by +0.03%.  The yen fell to a 1.5-week low against the dollar on Friday after Japan’s Jan consumer prices rose less than expected, a dovish factor for BOJ policy.  Also, higher T-note yields on Friday were bearish for the yen. Losses in the yen were limited after the dollar weakened when the US Supreme Court struck down President Trump’s global tariffs.  The yen also found support Friday after Japan’s Feb S&P manufacturing PMI rose at the strongest pace in three years.  Divergent central bank policies are also supportive of the yen, with the BOJ seen raising interest rates in the near term, while the Fed and ECB keep their rates steady or cut them. Japan’s Jan national CPI rose +1.5% y/y, weaker than expectations of +1.6% y/y and the smallest pace of increase in 3.75 years.  Jan national CPI ex-fresh food and energy rose +2.6% y/y, weaker than expectations of +2.7% y/y and the smallest pace of increase in 11 months. The Japan Feb S&P manufacturing PMI rose +1.3 to 52.8, the strongest pace of expansion in three years. The markets are discounting a +12% chance of a BOJ rate hike at the next meeting on March 19. April COMEX gold (GCJ26) on Friday closed up by +83.50 (+1.67%), and March COMEX silver (SIH26) closed up +4.709 (+6.07%). Gold and silver prices rallied sharply on Friday, posting 1-week highs.  Heightened geopolitical risks in the Middle East are boosting demand for precious metals as a safe haven.  Concerns about a possible conflict between the US and Iran are mounting after President Trump said 10 to 15 days were “pretty much” all he would allow for talks on a nuclear deal with Iran.  Gains in precious metals accelerated on Friday after the Supreme Court struck down President Trump’s global tariffs, as the removal of the tariff revenue will boost the US budget deficit, increasing demand for precious metals as a store of value. Precious metals also have support amid uncertainty over US tariffs and geopolitical risks in Iran, Ukraine, the Middle East, and Venezuela.  In addition, US political uncertainty, large US deficits, and uncertainty regarding government policies are prompting investors to cut holdings of dollar assets and shift into precious metals. Strong central bank demand for gold is also supportive of prices, following the recent news that bullion held in China’s PBOC reserves rose by +40,000 ounces to 74.19 million troy ounces in January, the fifteenth consecutive month the PBOC has boosted its gold reserves. Finally, increased liquidity in the financial system is boosting demand for precious metals as a store of value, following the FOMC’s December 10 announcement of a $40 billion-per-month liquidity injection into the US financial system. Gold and silver plunged from record highs on January 30 when President Trump announced he had nominated Keven Warsh as the new Fed Chair, which fueled massive liquidation of long positions in precious metals.  Mr. Warsh is one of the more hawkish candidates for Fed Chair and is seen as less supportive of deep interest rate cuts.  Also, recent volatility in precious metals prices has prompted trading exchanges worldwide to raise margin requirements for gold and silver, leading to the liquidation of long positions. Fund demand for precious metals remains strong, with long holdings in gold ETFs climbing to a 3.5-year high on January 28.  Also, long holdings in silver ETFs rose to a 3.5-year high on December 23, though liquidation has since knocked them down to a 2.5-month low on February 2.

      "content": "The SEC Just Opened the Door for Stablecoin Adoption Mitchell Duran Fri, February 20, 2026 at 12:27 PM PST 2 min read CRCL USDC-USD The SEC Just Opened the Door for Stablecoin Adoption - Moby BREAKING NEWS In between fears of a potential strike in Iran, the Supreme Court ruling that President Trump’s tariffs are illegal, and the President himself posting on Truth Social that he’s going to release files showing that aliens are, in fact, real, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made a massive shift in stablecoin regulation. In the statement, titled “Cutting by Two Would Do,” the SEC said it would “not object” if a broker-dealer were to apply a 2% haircut on proprietary positions in a payment stablecoin while calculating its net capital. While that may seem like inside-baseball, but it’s a huge deal for stablecoins like USDC and the firms that want to do business with it. The agency explicitly stated that a 100% haircut would be “unnecessarily punitive given the underlying reserve assets that back payment stablecoins,” pointing to U.S. dollars, short-term Treasuries, and other similar instruments. In case you’re not a broker ruler, the new guidance stems from SEC Rule 15c3-1, which is the bedrock of financial solvency in U.S. securities firms, acting as a liquidity test that requires broker-dealers to hold enough liquid assets to make sure all customer claims cover market losses. It is a daily calculation where firms must take \"haircuts\" (or percentage deductions) on the market value of their assets to account for risk. Our analysts just identified a stock with the potential to be the next Nvidia. Tell us how you invest and we'll show you why it's our #1 pick. Tap here. Until now, stablecoins were effectively treated as speculative assets. They carried 100% haircuts due to regulatory uncertainty under the Biden-era SEC. In practice, that meant they counted as zero toward regulatory capital. For broker-dealers, holding stablecoins was largely pointless — capital charges were punitive, accounting treatment was messy, and bankruptcy protections were unclear. Moving from 100% to 2% changes everything. It officially solidifies stablecoins like USDC and others as a gold standard for regulation. In the world of broker-dealer capital, 2% is a minimal charge reserved for the safest, most liquid assets, with cash being 0%. Some quick math, if the broker-dealer is holding $10 million in stablecoins, the firm only deducts $200,000, with the remaining $9.8 million counting as valid capital. It’s near-cash treatment. This is also a signal that the CLARITY Act, a bill specifically designed to create a regulatory framework for digital assets like stablecoins in the U.S., will hit the floor for a vote at some point in the near future. Story Continues This is also a big win for companies like Circle (CRCL), which, with SEC approval, reduces regulatory friction for firms to hold and use USDC. With greater use of USDC, the circulating supply and average balances will be higher as Wall Street \"cash\" floods into USDC. One stock.

      "content": "Meet the AI Stock That Could Be Worth $6 Trillion by 2030 Prosper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool Fri, February 20, 2026 at 12:50 PM PST 3 min read GOOG No publicly traded company has ever reached a market valuation of $6 trillion. However, that should happen over the next few years, and several major corporations aren't all that far from this milestone . One company that could be in this group is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , the parent company of Google. Here's why. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks » The business is strong First, note that this feat wouldn't require Alphabet to produce extraordinary returns. The company's current market cap is $3.7 trillion. To reach $6 trillion in four years, it needs a compound annual growth rate of 12.85%. That is above the market's long-term average, but it isn't an unreasonable target, either. Image source: Getty Images. Second, we can point to Alphabet's momentum. The company's core advertising business remains strong and has been improved thanks to artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. It has increased engagement on Google Search through features like AI Mode and AI Overviews, and has done likewise on YouTube through AI-powered recommendation algorithms. This has helped grow ad revenue. In the fourth quarter, ad sales jumped by 18% year over year to $113.8 billion, a strong performance for the tech leader. Third, we can look at the company's most important growth driver, its cloud business. During the fourth quarter, cloud revenue soared 47.8% year over year. Its AI services are playing a prominent role here, and demand remains high. Alphabet ended the period with a cloud backlog of $247 billion, increasing 55% sequentially and by more than 100% year over year. Strong demand for cloud and AI services could power Alphabet's growth over the next four years, helping it deliver consistently strong financial results and sending its market cap above $6 trillion. Potential challenges Alphabet's shares dropped after its fourth-quarter earnings report, largely because some investors worry about the company's runaway capital expenditures. If this investment isn't backed by strong revenue increases in the upcoming quarters, the stock will fall even more, especially as the shares look much more expensive -- valuation-wise -- than they did six months ago. The business is also facing a very competitive landscape in cloud computing. Its advertising business could decline as economic problems arise, and companies decrease ad spending. It's important to keep all these challenges in mind because they could hinder growth in the next four years. Story Continues Even so, management has shown the ability to overcome similar challenges. It can also cut spending, as it has in the past, if the spending doesn't deliver the return on investment it expects or if economic challenges arise. A lot could happen over the next four years, but even if Alphabet fails to reach $6 trillion by 2030, the company still looks like an excellent buy-and-hold in the long term. Should you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) rose almost 0.7%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) gained roughly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) led gains, up nearly 0.9%. All three major averages posted weekly gains. Stocks reversed course on the heels of the decision as investors kept an eye out for US-Iran tensions and private credit jitters. The Supreme Court ruled on Friday morning that Trump overstepped his powers in invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs on several trading partners in April. In response, President Trump said in a press conference that his administration will be placing a \"10% global tariff\" to replace the duties struck down by the high court. Get the latest reaction and fallout to the SCOTUS ruling in our tariff blog here Wall Street learned earlier Friday that US GDP grew more slowly than expected in the fourth quarter, coming in at 1.4%, far behind forecasts. Meanwhile, the \"core\" personal expenditures index — Fed rate-setters' preferred gauge of inflation — rose more than expected in December, on a monthly and annual basis. The watch is on for signs of stress in the private credit sector, after Blue Owl's ( OBDC , OWL ) halt to withdrawals.

Fri, February 20, 2026 at 7:24 PM UTC Ines Ferré Cybersecurity stocks fall, re-sparking fears of AI disruption Cybersecurity software stocks fell on Friday after Anthropic announced a new security capability for its Claude AI model, resurfacing concerns of sector-wide disruption. CrowdStrike ( CRWD ) dropped 5%, while Zscaler ( ZS ) also fell about 3%. Meanwhile, Cloudflare ( NET ) shares decreased 6%. Anthropic said the new feature, available in a limited research preview, “scans codebases for security vulnerabilities and suggests targeted software patches for human review, allowing teams to find and fix security issues that traditional methods often miss.” Wall Street has been pushing back against the sell-off, which started in software and expanded into cybersecurity, wealth management, and even logistics in recent weeks. Investors fear AI will impact margins as customers turn to AI solutions and the barrier to entry for startups decreases. Fri, February 20, 2026 at 6:47 PM UTC Trump says he'll impose 10% 'global' tariff, blasts Supreme Court President Trump said in a press briefing on Friday that his administration will be placing a \"10% global tariff ... over and above the normal tariffs already being charged\" now that the Supreme Court has struck down his wide-sweeping tariff regime. In a 6-3 vote on Friday, the Supreme Court ruled that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not give the president the authority to levy tariffs , dealing a blow to the Trump administration's signature economic policy. The high court's ruling, Trump said at the briefing, was \"deeply disappointing.\" In those tariffs' place, which the president claimed authority under IEEPA to implement, a global tariff authorized under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 will now be put in place, and the administration will be starting several trade investigations under Section 301. The White House, Trump said, is ready to replace his tariff regime, struck down by the Supreme Court, with \"methods, statutes, practices, and authorities\" recognized by the court system and Congress that \"are even stronger than IEEPA tariffs.\" The alternative measures the administration will now put in place to replace the tariffs will \"actually increase\" the amount of money coming into the country, based on the court's decision, Trump said at the briefing. The president also mentioned that \"all national security tariffs\" under Section 232 and Section 301 \"remain fully in place and in full force and effect.\" The Supreme Court's ruling on Friday leaves tariffs implemented under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 — which cite national-security concerns — unchanged, keeping in place a range of import duties on products ranging from copper and semiconductors to automobiles and wood products such as cabinetry. Section 232 tariffs include 50% levies on imports of semi-finished copper products, 25% levies on certain imported semiconductors — including Nvidia's ( NVDA ) H200 chips — and automobile tariffs, including 25% levies on trucks and 10% levies on buses . Fri, February 20, 2026 at 5:51 PM UTC Brooke DiPalma Furniture, cookware stocks move higher as NRF says Supreme Court ruling provides 'certainty' Furniture and cookware stocks are getting a boost following the highly anticipated Supreme Court ruling against President Trump's authority to issue tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Bob's Discount Furniture ( BOBS ), which listed on the NYSE Feb. 5, was up as much as 5%. Wayfair ( W ), Arhaus ( ARHS ), and Williams-Sonoma Inc. ( WSM ) also made gains. In an interview with Yahoo Finance two weeks ago, Bob's Discount Furniture president and CEO Bill Barton called 2025 \"a challenging year with tariffs.\" He added, \"We don't sell any third-party brands; everything we sell is made for us. We have deep long-standing relationships with our manufacturing partners ... through those relationships, we were able to renegotiate costs, to get costs down to offset a lot of the tariffs.\" Like many retailers, Barton said the team moved countries and factories to reduce costs and, as a last resort, the company raised prices for consumers. The National Retail Federation said in a statement that this provides \"much-needed certainty\" for businesses and manufacturers alike. \"Clear and consistent trade policy is essential for economic growth, creating jobs and opportunities for American families. We urge the lower court to ensure a seamless process to refund the tariffs to US importers. The refunds will serve as an economic boost and allow companies to reinvest in their operations, their employees and their customers,\" the release said.

Crude oil and gasoline prices settled lower on Friday amid concerns about energy demand after the US Q4 GDP grew at a slower-than-expected pace.  However, losses in crude were limited due to a weaker dollar and geopolitical risks in the Middle East.

Sign Up Now! Friday's weaker-than-expected US economic news was bearish for energy demand and crude prices.  Q4 GDP rose +1.4% (q/q annualized), weaker than expectations of +2.8%.  Also, the Feb S&P manufacturing PMI fell -1.2 to 51.2, weaker than expectations of no change at 52.4.  In addition, the University of Michigan US Feb consumer sentiment index was revised lower by -0.7 to 56.6, weaker than expectations of no change at 57.3. Crude prices jumped to a 6.5-month high on Thursday amid mounting geopolitical risks in the Middle East.  President Trump on Friday ramped up pressure on Iran to strike a deal over its nuclear program, saying he's considering a limited military strike on Iran to force it to accept a deal over its nuclear program.  On Thursday, Mr. Trump said 10 to 15 days was \"pretty much\" the \"maximum\" he would allow for negotiations to continue, and \"We're either going to get a deal, or it's going to be unfortunate for them.\" Axios reported Wednesday that there's no evidence of a diplomatic breakthrough with Iran on a nuclear deal, and any military operation against Iran would likely be a joint US-Israeli campaign that could last for weeks and be much broader in scope than last month's US operation in Venezuela.  Meanwhile, the US Department of Transportation recently issued a maritime advisory stating that American-flagged ships should stay as far as possible from Iranian waters when navigating the Strait of Hormuz.  Iran is OPEC's fourth-largest producer, and a US attack on the country could disrupt its 3.3 million bpd of crude production and potentially close the Strait of Hormuz, through which about 20% of the world's oil passes. Wednesday's US-brokered meeting in Geneva to end the war between Russia and Ukraine ended early as Ukrainian President Zelenskiy accused Russia of dragging out the war.  Russia has said the \"territorial issue\" remains unresolved with Ukraine, and there's \"no hope of achieving a long-term settlement\" to the war until Russia's demand for territory in Ukraine is accepted.  The outlook for the Russia-Ukraine war to continue will keep restrictions on Russian crude in place and is bullish for oil prices. Story Continues Mounting crude supplies in floating storage are a bearish factor for oil prices.  According to Vortexa data, about 290 million bbl of Russian and Iranian crude are currently in floating storage on tankers, more than 50% higher than a year ago, due to blockades and sanctions on Russian and Iranian crude.  Vortexa reported Monday that crude oil stored on tankers that have been stationary for at least 7 days fell by -8.2% w/w to 86.95 million bbl in the week ended February 13. An increase in crude exports from Venezuela is also boosting global oil supplies and is bearish for prices.  Reuters reported last Monday that Venezuelan crude exports rose to 800,000 bpd in January from 498,000 bpd in December. Last Tuesday, the EIA raised its 2026 US crude production estimate to 13.60 million bpd from 13.59 million bpd last month, and raised its US 2026 energy consumption estimate to 96.00 (quadrillion btu) from 95.37 last month.  The IEA last month cut its 2026 global crude surplus estimate to 3.7 million bpd from last month's estimate of 3.815 million bpd. On February 1, OPEC+ said it would stick to its plan to pause production increases through Q1 of 2026.  OPEC+ at its November 2025 meeting announced that members would raise production by +137,000 bpd in December, but will then pause the production hikes in Q1-2026 due to the emerging global oil surplus.  OPEC+ is trying to restore all of the 2.2 million bpd production cut it made in early 2024, but still has another 1.2 million bpd of production left to restore.  OPEC's January crude production fell by -230,000 bpd to a 5-month low of 28.83 million bpd. Ukrainian drone and missile attacks have targeted at least 28 Russian refineries over the past six months, limiting Russia's crude oil export capabilities and reducing global oil supplies.  Also, since the end of November, Ukraine has ramped up attacks on Russian tankers, with at least six tankers attacked by drones and missiles in the Baltic Sea.  In addition, new US and EU sanctions on Russian oil companies, infrastructure, and tankers have curbed Russian oil exports. Thursday's EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of February 13 were -6.0% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were +3.3% above the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -5.8% below the 5-year seasonal average.  US crude oil production in the week ending February 13 rose +0.2% w/w to 13.735 million bpd, just below the record high of 13.862 million bpd from the week of November 7. Baker Hughes reported Friday that the number of active US oil rigs in the week ended February 20 was unchanged at 409, just above the 4.25-year low of 406 rigs posted in the week ended December 19.  Over the past 2.5 years, the number of US oil rigs has fallen sharply from the 5.5-year high of 627 rigs reported in December 2022.

March nat-gas prices on Friday settled higher on a shift in US weather forecasts to colder temperatures, potentially boosting heating demand for nat-gas.  On Friday, the Commodity Weather Group said that forecasts shifted colder, with below-normal temperatures expected across the US Midwest through February 24.

Sign Up Now! US (lower-48) dry gas production on Friday was 113.4 bcf/day (+12.5% y/y), according to BNEF.  Lower-48 state gas demand on Friday was 91.6 bcf/day (-30.3% y/y), according to BNEF.  Estimated LNG net flows to US LNG export terminals on Friday were 19.8 bcf/day (+1.5% w/w), according to BNEF. Projections for higher US nat-gas production are bearish for prices.  Last Tuesday, the EIA raised its forecast for 2026 US dry nat-gas production to 109.97 bcf/day from last month's estimate of 108.82 bcf/day.  US nat-gas production is currently near a record high, with active US nat-gas rigs posting a 2.5-year high last Friday. Natural gas prices surged to a 3-year high on January 28, driven by the massive storm that disrupted the US with Arctic cold weather.  The well below normal temperatures caused freeze-ups in gas wells, disrupted production in Texas and elsewhere, and drove a spike in demand for natural gas for heating.   About 50 billion cubic feet of natural gas came offline, or about 15% of total US natural gas production, due to freeze-ups. As a negative factor for gas prices, the Edison Electric Institute reported Thursday that US (lower-48) electricity output in the week ended February 14 fell -1.61% y/y to 83,348 GWh (gigawatt hours).  However, US electricity output in the 52-week period ending February 14 rose +2.36% y/y to 4,314,431 GWh. Thursday's weekly EIA report was bearish for nat-gas prices, as nat-gas inventories for the week ended February 13 fell by -144 bcf, a smaller draw than the market consensus of -149 bcf and the 5-year weekly average draw of -151 bcf.  As of February 13, nat-gas inventories were down -1.5% y/y and -5.6% below their 5-year seasonal average, signaling tight nat-gas supplies.  As of February 18, gas storage in Europe was 32% full, compared to the 5-year seasonal average of 49% full for this time of year. Story Continues Baker Hughes reported Friday that the number of active US nat-gas drilling rigs in the week ending February 20 was unchanged at a 2.5-year high of 133 rigs.  In the past year, the number of gas rigs has risen from the 4.75-year low of 94 rigs reported in September 2024.

      "content": "Lemonade’s Sweet Results Refresh Market Appetite: Rebound Ahead Thomas Hughes, MarketBeat Fri, February 20, 2026 at 12:36 PM PST 4 min read LMND Lemonade mobile app interface displayed on a smartphone, highlighting AI-driven insurance platform growth Key Points Lemonade's sweet guidance has investors and analysts rethinking their positions. Short interest is high, with a growing potential for short covering to continue lifting this market. Management improved the profitability outlook, creating a catalyst for higher share prices. Interested in Lemonade, Inc.? Here are five stocks we like better. Lemonade’s (NYSE: LMND) sweet Q4 2026 results triggered a floor in the stock's price action, indicating a high potential for it to rebound and set a fresh long-term high. The results were blowout, affirming the company’s flywheel is gaining momentum. Lemonade's AI-enabled insurance platform and pricing model drive value for its users, which attracts new users who, in turn, improve the company’s offering. More users enable Lemonade to provide better, more-targeted services, further improving its operational quality and appeal to users and investors. The takeaway is that this growth story is still in its early chapters and has a long runway ahead. → Draganfly’s CEO Says Drones Are Becoming Intelligence Platforms—Not Just Hardware Lemonade Accelerates on Client Growth and Premium Gains Lemonade had a solid quarter with revenue of $228.1 million, up more than 50% year-over-year (YOY) and 500 basis points ahead of consensus. The growth was underpinned by a 28% increase in gross earned premium, a 31% increase in in-force premium (IFP), and a 7% increase in premium per customer. The customer count was also up a stronger-than-expected 23%, offset only by a 1% decline in ADR. ADR, a measure of retained premium, declined due to the non-renewal of policies that failed to meet underwriting criteria. While a headwind, it is near-term in nature, ultimately setting the company up with improved portfolio and operational quality. → DTE’s Stargate Deal Turns Power Into Profits The margin news was also robust . The company widened its gross margin and significantly narrowed its reported losses, with gross margin up by 500 basis points and free cash flow positive. Free cash flow grew by 37% to $37 million and is expected to continue improving as the quarters progress. The guidance was also blow-out quality. The company forecasts $1.187 billion in revenue for 2026 at the low end of its range, more than 230 basis points above analyst consensus. The guidance assumes revenue will accelerate again, with growth topping 60% for the year. Growth drivers include Pet, Car, and Europe, which supported both client and premium-per-client growth. → PayPal Is Back Near IPO-Era Prices—Value Setup or Value Trap? Story Continues Analyst Response Signals Sentiment Shift for Lemonade The initial analyst response to the news was bullish, though no revisions were issued immediately after the release. Commentaries focused on solid performance, improving loss ratio, and guidance, including an improved timeline for profitability. Management forecasts positive adjusted EBITDA by year-end and a profitable 2027, fully one year earlier than expected. As it stands, MarketBeat tracks nine analysts covering Lemonade stock; they rate it as a Hold with a 45% Buy-side bias (33% of ratings are pegged at Sell), and forecast a $70 price point. The $70 price target suggests the stock is fairly valued as of mid-February, providing a floor for the price action, as it is up significantly on a last-12-months basis and aligned with critical moving averages. The likely outcome is that this stock consolidates near mid-February levels in preparation for an advance, which could be triggered by analyst upgrades in the coming weeks. Institutions Cause Volatility in Lemonade Stock Prices Institutions are bullish on Lemonade, owning more than 80% of the shares and buying on balance quarterly for nine consecutive quarters. However, activity, both bullish and bearish, ramped to record levels in early 2026, putting a cap on the market. Assuming this trend persists, LMND shares will likely trade sideways within their range until a more compelling catalyst emerges. The technical action reflects the mixed analysts and institutional sentiment. Price action has been ratcheting higher, with peaks followed by significant pullbacks, as seen in early 2026. Lemonade’s market tried to rally on the guidance update but was unable to sustain the advance. LMND stock chart displaying consolidation at a critical support target. The pullback could drop to $60 or even $50 in the extreme case, as short interest is also high, running near 18% in early February. The question is whether shorts still view this stock as overvalued given its now-improved earnings outlook. If price action improves and LMND rallies, shorts could be forced to cover, boosting near-term gains.

Bitcoin coin dark background by Johannes Blumel via Pixabay Faisal Humayun Khan Fri, February 20, 2026 at 1:07 PM PST 3 min read BTC-USD GS It’s been a roller coaster ride for Bitcoin (BTCUSD) investors in the last six months. The crypto asset touched all-time highs of $126,223 in October 2025. While market participants were expecting the bull run to sustain, Bitcoin reversed sharply and currently trades lower by 46.8% at $67,704. While the steep correction might have created some panic, it’s important to note that deep correction after a big rally is not uncommon for Bitcoin. As an example, Bitcoin dropped from $69,000 towards the end of 2021 to $15,000 by the end of 2022. There are similar instances through the price history of Bitcoin. More News from Barchart Why Michael Saylor Isn’t Worried About MicroStrategy Stock Unless Bitcoin Drops Below $8,000 Markets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines. www.barchart.com Therefore, the deep correction might be a good time to gradually accumulate the crypto asset. From the perspective of wider adoption, even Bitcoin skeptics seem to be considering some positions. Recently, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon disclosed that he holds very limited amounts of Bitcoin. This is a significant shift from his previous opinion that there is no “real use case” for the cryptocurrency. Clarity Act as a Catalyst One factor that has contributed to volatility and relatively low investor participation is regulatory headwinds. However, this could change once the Clarity Act is approved. Broadly, the act targets to provide clearer regulation for digital assets. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently commented that it was “important for Congress to pass a bill to create federal rules for digital assets.” Bessent also opined that the act would give \"great comfort to the market\" in times of volatility. Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong is also hopeful that the Clarity Act is likely to be passed “in the next few months.” In addition, popular prediction market platform Polymarket is showing a 90% probability of Crypto Act approval. Therefore, with a significantly high probability of regulatory headwinds waning, it’s likely that Bitcoin will be supported at lower levels. Standard Chartered believes that Bitcoin can drop to $50,000 before recovering to $100,000 by the end of 2026. Bitcoin Adoption and Growth in Money Supply Importantly, as of December 2025, the Bitcoin in circulation was 19.9 million. Further, the maximum supply is restricted to 21 million with the final Bitcoin expected to be mined in 2140. Therefore, the supply of the digital asset is restricted compared to fiat currencies. To put things into perspective, global money supply has increased from $1 trillion in 1970 to $100 trillion. With the likelihood of continued growth in money supply, hard assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin (among digital assets) are likely to trend higher. According to a base case estimate by Wisdom Tree analyst, money supply is likely to grow at 5% annually, reaching $134 trillion by 2030. Assuming that Bitcoin captures 12% of the hard-asset basket, the price of the crypto asset is likely to touch $275,000 by the end of the decade. Story Continues Notably, Bitcoin adoption curve indicates that global adoption will increase by 10x in less than eight years. Further, a 40x growth in adoption is likely in less than 20 years. With limited supply, growing adoption will imply price trending higher. Concluding Thoughts Bitcoin continues to be in a phase of price discovery amidst the need for regulatory clarity. However, there is little doubt on the point that the crypto adoption continues to increase. And so, the correction in Bitcoin seems like a prime buying opportunity with the “Clarity Act” likely to be a near-term positive catalyst. In the long term, limited supply is likely to support the uptrend.

What happened According to the SEC filing dated February 17, 2026, Daventry Group sold all 367,751 shares of SentinelOne in the fourth quarter. The net position change for the quarter was $6.48 million, reflecting the combined effects of the share sale and shifts in SentinelOne’s stock price. The fund now reports no stake in SentinelOne. What else to know Top holdings after the filing: NYSE:ESTC: $29.01 million (24.0% of AUM) NASDAQ:MDB: $28.41 million (23.5% of AUM) NASDAQ:TTAN: $24.11 million (20.0% of AUM) NASDAQ:SAIL: $18.89 million (15.7% of AUM) NYSE:BDC: $11.03 million (9.1% of AUM) As of February 17, 2026, shares of SentinelOne were priced at $13.40, down 45.0% over the past year and trailing the S&P 500 by 57.88 percentage points. The position was previously 4.6% of the fund's AUM as of the prior quarter. Company overview Metric Value Price (as of market close 2026-02-17) $13.40 Market Capitalization $4.48 billion Revenue (TTM) $955.65 million Net Income (TTM) -$411.29 million Company snapshot SentinelOne delivers cybersecurity solutions focused on endpoint protection, extended detection and response (XDR), cloud workload security, and IoT security, primarily through its Singularity XDR Platform. The company provides AI-powered autonomous threat prevention, detection, and response capabilities to organizations. SentinelOne targets enterprise customers and organizations seeking advanced, automated cybersecurity solutions across the United States and international markets. SentinelOne, Inc. is a technology company specializing in cybersecurity, with a focus on AI-driven threat detection and response. The company leverages its proprietary Singularity XDR Platform to deliver scalable, autonomous security solutions to enterprises globally. SentinelOne's strategy emphasizes innovation in automated cyber defense, positioning it as a competitive provider in the software infrastructure segment. What this transaction means for investors This exit removes what had been a 4.6% position and tightens a book already concentrated in software names like Elastic, MongoDB, and Titan, each representing double-digit percentages of assets. In other words, this looks less like a verdict on cybersecurity and more like a capital reallocation inside a high-conviction growth portfolio. To be clear, SentinelOne’s fundamentals hardly scream distress. Third quarter revenue rose 23% year over year to $258.9 million, and annualized recurring revenue climbed to $1.06 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin turned positive at 7%, compared to a 5% loss a year ago, and free cash flow margin reached 6%. That is tangible progress toward sustainable profitability. The stock, however, is down 45% over the past year, badly trailing the broader market. For long-term investors, that gap is the real story. If you believe AI native security platforms with improving margins deserve time, volatility may be the price of admission. But if you prefer tighter capital discipline inside a concentrated growth fund, trimming laggards to fund higher conviction ideas is hardly irrational. Story Continues Should you buy stock in SentinelOne right now?

A concept image of a cancer cell 3dMediSphere via Shutterstock Wajeeh Khan Fri, February 20, 2026 at 1:19 PM PST 2 min read Grail (GRAL) shares were cut in half on Feb. 20 after the biotech firm said its highly anticipated NHS-Galleri clinical trial failed to meet its primary endpoint. As retail and institutional investors bailed on GRAL today, its 14-day relative strength index (RSI) crashed to 24, indicating a technical rebound was likely in the near term.

Sign Up Now! Still, investors are recommended against buying the dip in Grail stock, even though it looks like a bargain at about $49. www.barchart.com Should You Bet on a Swift Rebound in Grail Stock? NHS-Galleri was a massive 142,000-participant trial intended to validate Grail’s multi-cancer early detection (MCED) test. Its failure to meet the primary goal of a statistically significant reduction in combined Stage III and IV cancer diagnoses hurts GRAL stock because it weighs on MCED’s immediate commercial and regulatory trajectory. Without a clear win in this “landmark” study, the path toward universal adoption by national health systems, and the high-margin revenue that follows,  is now shrouded in uncertainty. Grail is unattractive to buy on the dip also because it crashed through all of its key moving averages (MAs) today, signaling bears have firmly taken control across multiple timeframes. Financials Also Warrant Selling GRAL Shares Beyond this clinical failure, the bearish narrative for Grail shares is underpinned by what can only be described as a grueling financial reality. While the biotech firm beat quarterly loss estimates, it’s yet to turn a profit and is burning through hundreds of millions in cash annually. With a return on equity (ROE) of minus 16.8%, GRAL looks overvalued relative to peers at a price to sales (P/S) multiple of about 25. Investors must also contend with a “higher-than-anticipated” incidence of Stage III cancers in the study and a $22 billion debt overhang in the broader sector that limits refinancing options. Note that Grail has historically lost over 30% on average in March, which makes it significantly less attractive as an investment today. What to Expect From Wall Street After NHS-Galleri Failure Heading into Friday, Wall Street analysts had a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating on GRAL shares with a mean target of about $114. Story Continues However, it’s reasonable to assume that downward revisions will follow now that its NHS-Galleri trial has failed. www.barchart.com On the date of publication, Wajeeh Khan did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Leo Sun, The Motley Fool Fri, February 20, 2026 at 4:05 PM CST 3 min read IONQ QBTS IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) and D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS) are both early movers in the quantum computing market. However, both stocks have declined by more than 20% this year as investors pivoted toward more conservative investments. Which of these quantum stocks has a better shot at bouncing back in 2026 and beyond? Image source: Getty Images. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks » The differences between IonQ and D-Wave Quantum computers can perform specific tasks faster than classical computers, but they're larger, more expensive, consume more power, and produce a higher error rate. IonQ wants to shrink those systems and improve their accuracy by using tiny lasers to trap ions in a quantum state. Those trapped ion systems don't need to be cryogenically refrigerated like traditional electron-based systems, which accelerate electrons through superconducting loops. IonQ produces four systems: its older Aria system, its flagship Forte system, its data center-oriented Forte Enterprise system, and its upcoming Tempo system. It also provides its quantum computing power as a cloud-based service. IonQ's systems can be used across a wide range of industries and achieve higher accuracy (gate fidelity) than most electron systems. Much of its recent growth has been driven by large government contracts. D-Wave's electron-driven systems, which require refrigeration, are only used for quantum annealing services, which identify processes that consume the least power. By having D-Wave analyze their workflows, supply chains, and logistics networks, large organizations can identify the processes that consume the least computing power as the most efficient ones. D-Wave designs its own quantum processing units (QPUs) and quantum systems. It also provides remote access to those systems through its cloud-based Leap platform. Its newest Advantage 2 quantum systems can solve certain problems 25,000 times faster than its first-gen Advantage system while consuming less power. D-Wave initially attracted a lot of attention from enterprise customers, but it's also been gaining more government contracts. Which stock looks more reasonably valued? From 2025 to 2027, analysts expect IonQ's revenue to nearly triple from $109 million to $317 million. They expect D-Wave's revenue to more than triple from $26 million to $81 million. Neither company is expected to break even anytime soon. With a market cap of $11.8 billion, IonQ is already valued at 37 times its 2027 sales. D-Wave, which is valued at $7.2 billion, trades at 89 times its 2027 sales. Story Continues Both of these stocks are highly speculative. But if I had to pick one over the other, I'd stick with IonQ because it serves a broader market, its trapped-ion technology is focused on miniaturization, accuracy, and lower costs; and its stock looks cheaper relative to its 2027 sales. Should you buy stock in IonQ right now? Before you buy stock in IonQ, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and IonQ wasn’t one of them.

And as I’ve said here, there, and everywhere — I don’t get it. It is not that I’m anti-income. Just the opposite, in fact. But these ETFs do not typically add to return, and they don’t remove much risk of major loss. Historically, most of them get about 80% to 95% of the upside of the underlying ETF or stock index basket. And roughly the same portion of the downside. In other words, take an ETF that writes covered calls on the S&P 500 Index ($SPX) or Nasdaq 100 ($IUXX). If you look at the returns over time for those ETFs, they will likely track those indexes up and down. Most of their value to investors is to convert gains in that index into monthly cash flow.

Dear IonQ Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for February 25 Stop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now! But what about when the underlying index doesn’t go up? Not just for a little while, but for years? Oops. What happens to the covered call ETF? It keeps paying you a decent income. That’s the part you see hit your account each month. But if you also look at your account holding that ETF, guess what? It is down. Way down. An Example That Shows the Difference — And Maybe the Disconnect This table shows the Nasdaq QQQ Invesco ETF (QQQ) and the GX Nasdaq-100 Covered Call ETF (QYLD). QQQ, you likely know well. It is approaching $400 billion in assets. QYLD is no slouch, at more than $8 billion, making it the largest covered call ETF tied to an index. JPM Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI) is the biggest in that peer group, but its stock selection is done actively. QQQ yields next to nothing, but QYLD yields more than 11%. And over the past 12 months, that yield has served to offset a decline in QYLD’s price. Because funding the income distribution is done by writing covered calls on the Nasdaq 100, a process that sacrifices upside potential for option income now. www.barchart.com In round numbers, over the past 12 months, QQQ has made 12%. QYLD has made about 6%, which is the yield minus the “principal drag” from forsaking most of the upside in order to spin off monthly cash flow, funded by option premiums. Most covered call ETFs work similarly. And here’s where I think the disconnect is: When the underlying, QQQ in this case, goes up nicely, no one notices the mechanics. But what about when QQQ goes down, and not just for a month or two? Story Continues We don’t have to wonder. Because the bond market has just given us three years of evidence. To show what could be the fate of many billions in equity covered call ETFs in the years ahead, I’ve analyzed the relationship between 20+ Year Treas Bond Ishares ETF (TLT), which is currently the seventh-largest bond ETF at $45 billion in assets, and an ETF that writes covered calls on TLT, the Ishares 20+ Year T-Bond Buywrite Strategy ETF (TLTW). And since part of my punchline here is that one of my favorite ways to offset those very evident risks of covered call ETFs is to take two additional steps: 1. Hedge it , using an ETF that essentially shorts the underlying security that the covered call ETF is writing income on. In simple terms, we are saying, “Give me the income from the covered call writing, but offset the price risk.” The Short 20+ Year Treasury -1X ETF (TBF) is structured to move opposite TLT, and TLTW is just TLT with covered-call writing. So, TBF is a good pairing with TLTW, to hedge the downside risk. At least at first glance. The net result, however, might eliminate too much of the total return. So there’s another step. 2. Manage the pair “tactically.” All that means is you own TLTW and TBF, to get that hedged impact and keep the income. But rather than own them in fixed-percentage weightings, you allocate between them, adjusting those weightings as market conditions dictate. How do you determine when and how much to tilt this two-ETF portfolio (TLTW and TBF) one way or the other, at any point in time? There are many ways. I can only speak for the one I created, which I have covered here before. The ROAR score approach, which prioritizes confronting downside risk via a 0-to-100 score, updated daily. 100 is low risk, 0 is high risk, 50 is neutral risk. I applied the ROAR scores for TLTW and TBF over the past three-plus years, and created a mechanism to automatically calculate the weightings for the two ETFs at any point during that time. Then, I strung the returns together, shown below. Chart courtesy of Rob Isbitts via ROAR.PiTrade.com. That blue line above is frankly what prompted me to bring this to the attention of this audience. Because the stock market has not been an ideal stress-test environment for the downside risk of covered call ETFs the past few years. But bonds have been a great testing ground. TLT, in particular, as it has been a very inconsistent return-generator. That blue line is the two-ETF mix “ROARed,” if you will, over that time. We see the dramatic outperformance of that TLTW-TBF mix, with the ROAR score directing traffic compared to TLT alone. This is akin to the earlier example, and saying that a mix of QYLD and the Inverse Nasdaq 100 ETF (PSQ) is likely to outperform QQQ strongly in a bear market. Because you have the downside covered, and you still have most of the income rolling in. Chart courtesy of Rob Isbitts via YCharts. Finally the graph above looks at that same portfolio but versus TLTW and TLT, as well as comparing it to a straight-line 8% return. Quite a correlation to the latter. The Takeaway This is just one quick example of the power of hedging, but also the willingness to be an active investor amid the post-pandemic market environment. Because I don’t think it's changing back to the old way any time soon. And whether you use something like ROAR, or you create or follow any other tactical discipline, this shows that covered call ETFs are not all bad in tough markets — as long as you know how to give them some company, to smooth the ride.

      "content": "Millions of Americans Are Still Earning Almost Nothing on Their Savings Evan Cole Fri, February 20, 2026 at 4:00 PM CST 5 min read Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Even after the Federal Reserve's rate hikes—and a series of rate cuts that still left borrowing costs elevated—millions of Americans continue to park their cash in accounts that pay next to nothing, missing out on a moment when safe money can actually earn a meaningful return. The gap is no longer subtle as the FDIC's national rate for savings accounts sits at 0.39%, according to the agency's latest update. Yet top high-yield savings accounts are advertising up to 5.00% APY in late February, according to daily rate trackers. That spread, more than a full four percentage points, creates a compounding penalty for households that keep emergency funds or down payment savings in traditional bank accounts out of habit. A High-Rate World, a Low-Rate Savings Account A basic reason the math looks so lopsided is that interest rates in the broader economy remain far above where they sat for most of the 2010s. The Fed's policy rate is still in the 3.50% to 3.75% range, with the upper limit at 3.75% as of Feb. 20, according to the St. Louis Fed's FRED database. Banks don't move in lockstep with the Fed, but the rate environment matters. When risk-free yields rise (on Treasury bills, money markets, and bank deposits) savings accounts have room to pay more. Online banks and nontraditional players, which tend to compete aggressively for deposits, have done exactly that. Traditional banks, by contrast, often don't have to. Bankrate's survey shows the national average savings yield at 0.6% APY as of late February, even as the best high-yield savings accounts are paying around 4% APY. In other words, even the average saver is likely earning far less than what's available to someone who shops around. The Cost of Doing Nothing The problem isn't that 0.39% is bad in the abstract. It's that it's functionally irrelevant in a world where inflation is still running above the Fed's target and households are watching every line item push budgets tighter. At 0.39%, $10,000 earns about $39 over a year. At 4.50%, it earns about $450. On $30,000, the difference becomes thousands of dollars over a few years—without taking market risk, without locking money up, and without changing behavior beyond where the cash sits. CBS News illustrated the math using the FDIC national average. A $40,000 balance at 0.39% earns just $38.94 after three months and $77.92 after six months, assuming rates stay constant. Scale that same balance to a competitive high-yield rate and the gap becomes meaningful income—especially for households trying to rebuild cash buffers. Story Continues This is the part many savers don't fully internalize; the opportunity cost isn't theoretical. It shows up as foregone interest every month. Why Big Banks Can Pay So Little The question is obvious. If high-yield accounts exist—and the numbers are publicly available—why do so many people still earn close to zero? One reason is simple inertia. Banking relationships are sticky, and consumers often treat savings accounts as infrastructure, not a product to optimize. Another is trust and convenience. People keep cash where their paycheck lands, where the branch is, where their debit card works, and where their bill pay is already set up. But the economics matter, too. Big banks with massive deposit bases don't always need to compete on rates. If a customer is unlikely to move money, the bank has little incentive to pay up. Online banks, which must attract deposits to grow, behave differently. Yet even that logic can be backward. Bankrate's 2026 forecast expects savings yields to trend lower over time, but still remain relevant—its analysis cites an expectation that top nationally available savings and money market rates could be around 3.70% APY by the end of 2026. If rates drift down, the best time to capture a better yield is typically before competition fades. The High Yield Fine Print Not all high-yield offers are created equal, and readers are right to be skeptical. Some promotions require direct deposits, debit transactions, or balance caps. Others use introductory rates that can reset without warning. That's why the most important comparison points are plain, whether the institution is FDIC- or NCUA-insured, whether the rate is a standard variable APY or a promotional teaser, and whether fees or minimums erase the benefit. The FDIC's own description of sweep and deposit insurance mechanics is a reminder that where cash sits can change the type of protection it receives. Consumers don't need to become bank analysts, but they do need to know what they're signing up for. What Savers Can Do Next For most people, the decision is letting idle cash sit in a near-zero account, or placing it somewhere that pays a market-competitive yield while staying liquid. That's a small move with outsized payoff—and one of the few financial wins left that doesn't require perfect timing, sophisticated strategy, or taking on more risk. If rates continue to slide later this year, savers may discover the window was wider than they realized.

(NASDAQ: OPEN ) is one of the 7 most volatile stocks under $5 for day trading . Analysts Remains Mixed on Opendoor Technologies (OPEN) Despite Strong Share Price Momentum As of February 16, 2026, Opendoor Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:OPEN)’s shares had climbed over 190% over last year and more than 80% in the last six months, indicating investor interest despite persistent operational concerns. On February 9, 2026, UBS described the most recent earnings as another reset point, raising its price target on Opendoor Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:OPEN) from $1.60 to $5.00 while keeping a ‘Neutral’ rating. The firm noted that Opendoor still needs to demonstrate that it can consistently produce positive unit economics in light of a steep drop in revenue and increased EBITDA losses. The next earnings report, which is due on February 19, will continue to be closely watched for profitability and margins. Prior to this, on January 20, 2026, Deutsche Bank maintained a ‘Hold’ rating on Opendoor Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:OPEN) while raising its target from $0.90 to $4.00. As the iBuyer model tackles the volatile housing environment, the updates collectively imply that analysts recognize improved sentiment and valuation recalibration but continue to exercise caution regarding execution risk. Opendoor Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:OPEN) operates a digital platform for buying and selling residential real estate, leveraging data-driven pricing and streamlined transactions to provide homeowners with liquidity and convenience across the United States. While we acknowledge the potential of OPEN as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

(NASDAQ: AUR ) is included in our list of the 7 most volatile stocks under $5 for day trading . Aurora Innovation (AUR)’s Acceleration Toward Autonomous Trucking Drives Analyst Confidence IM_photo/Shutterstock.com On February 12, 2026, despite the company’s minimal current revenue, Cantor Fitzgerald maintained its ‘Overweight’ rating and $12.00 price target for Aurora Innovation, Inc. (NASDAQ:AUR). With this update, the investment firm expressed its confidence in the company’s trajectory toward autonomous trucking. Since commercialization started in late April, Aurora Innovation, Inc. (NASDAQ:AUR) has accumulated more than 4.5 million autonomous miles, including more than 250,000 fully driverless miles. This achievement positions the company as a leader in self-driving freight, according to Cantor. However, the early-stage monetization profile was highlighted by the $2.00 million in revenue over the previous 12 months. By the end of 2026, management plans to have more than 200 driverless trucks, roughly matching Cantor’s previous estimate of 207 units, up from 10 as of December. The investment firm expressed confidence in Aurora Innovation, Inc. (NASDAQ:AUR)’s goal to achieve positive free cash flow in fiscal 2028 and breakeven (gross margins) by the end of fiscal 2026. With production scheduled to begin in 2027, Aurora’s exclusive partnership with Continental AG is seen as a crucial catalyst for scaling. Aurora Innovation, Inc. (NASDAQ:AUR), headquartered in Pittsburgh, develops the Aurora Driver, integrating hardware, software, and data services to enable autonomous vehicle operation, with a focus on long-haul trucking and logistics markets. While we acknowledge the potential of AUR as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Digital advertisers could stand to benefit from easing tariffs, if clients choose to channel refunds into higher ad spend, marketing research firm EMARKETER said. Companies that sell advertising were among Friday's gainers after the Supreme Court struck down most of President Donald Trump’s tariffs . The gains helped both Big Tech stocks and some smaller players. Shares of Pinterest ( PINS ) jumped 6%. Shares of Snap ( SNAP ), social media giant Meta Platforms ( META ) and Google parent Alphabet ( GOOGL ), which derive the bulk of their revenues from ad spending, also rose; Alphabet's 4% climb set it among the day's best performers on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. More from Yahoo Scout What challenges are Pinterest and Snap facing recently? How did Supreme Court tariff ruling affect advertising stocks? How are Meta and Alphabet performing differently than competitors? Why could digital advertisers benefit from easing tariffs? Digital advertisers could stand to benefit from easing tariffs, according to marketing research firm EMARKETER. Some clients could channel refunds into higher ad spending, the company said. Trump later Friday said he would impose a 10% global tariff , signaling the likelihood of further uncertainty around trade policy in 2026. Why This Matters to Investors Shifts in trade policy such as changes in tariffs can affect companies across a wide range of industries, including providers of digital services, as customers and partners react to the changes. With Friday’s move higher, Pinterest shares recovered some of their losses seen over the past week. The company said its retail clients pulled back on ad spending as they grappled with higher costs from tariffs. Snapchat owner Snap has also seen its stock lose ground in recent months amid some weakness in ad spending by large clients in North America. Both stocks have lost roughly half their value over the past 12 months. Meta and Alphabet , which recently reported surging ad sales, haven’t seen the same squeeze. Executives at Pinterest blamed the company’s higher mix of large retailers relative to its peers. Analysts at Bank of America suggested Pinterest also likely lost some of its market share to larger rivals. Some of them, such as Meta, have positioned their investments in AI-enhanced ad offerings as part of their strategy to weather tariff-related headwinds, with some signs of success.

The company named insider Asha Sharma as the executive vice president ‌and CEO of the gaming division. In her previous role, Sharma led product development for AI models ​and services at Microsoft. More from Yahoo Scout Why is Phil Spencer retiring from Microsoft Gaming? How will Asha Sharma change Xbox strategy? What challenges is Microsoft Gaming currently facing? What impact will leadership changes have on competition? Sharma said she would renew focus on the Xbox console, aiming to \"recommit to our core Xbox fans and players.\" Microsoft Gaming has been grappling with tariff-induced cost pressures, strong competition and uncertain consumer spending, prompting price rises on Xbox hardware. Last month, Microsoft ‌reported that its gaming revenue ⁠fell around 9.5% in the December quarter, and it recorded undisclosed impairment charges in the division. Microsoft had closed its $69 billion deal for \"Call ⁠of Duty\" maker Activision Blizzard in 2023, swelling its heft in the video-gaming market after heavy regulatory scrutiny. The company's gaming unit contends with robust competition from Sony's PlayStation, particularly regarding console ​market ​share and exclusive game offerings. Spencer said he would ​remain in an advisory role through ‌the summer to ensure a smooth handover. \"Last year, Phil Spencer made the decision to retire from the company, and since then we've been talking about succession planning,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said. The company also said Sarah Bond, president and chief operating officer at Xbox, is leaving the company \"to begin a new chapter.\" Matt Booty has taken over ‌the role of executive vice president and chief ​content officer at the gaming division, the company said. Booty ​was previously president of game content ​and studios at Microsoft, according to his LinkedIn page. The company said ‌Booty would report to Sharma, who ​previously worked at Meta ​and online grocery delivery firm Instacart. \"Microsoft's leadership transition is appropriate as it comes at a time when the technology underlying gaming is shifting. As AI becomes ​a bigger element in game ‌development, Microsoft needs a new generation of leaders to manage through this ​transition,\" said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria.

OpenAI's 2025 revenue totaled $13 billion, beating its $10 billion projection, while it spent $8 billion during the year, under its $9 billion target, the person said. More from Yahoo Scout What is the current valuation for OpenAI's fundraising? How did OpenAI's 2025 financial performance compare? What is OpenAI's projected compute spending through 2030? How are AI inference costs affecting OpenAI's margins? The development comes ‌as Nvidia closes ⁠in on finalizing a $30 billion investment in OpenAI, as part of a fundraising round in ⁠which the AI startup is seeking more than $100 billion. That would value the Sam Altman-led company at about $830 billion and ​amount to ​one of the largest ​private capital raises on ‌record. Microsoft-backed OpenAI expects more than $280 billion in total revenue by 2030, divided nearly equally across its consumer and enterprise units, according to CNBC, which had reported the development earlier. Altman had said last year that OpenAI is committed to ‌spending $1.4 trillion to develop 30 ​gigawatts of computing resources — enough to ​power roughly 25 ​million U.S. homes. Separately, The Information reported that ‌OpenAI told investors the expenses ​associated with running ​its AI models, referred to as inference, increased fourfold in 2025, resulting in a fall in its ​adjusted gross margin ‌to 33% from 40% in 2024.

See our Advertiser Disclosure . 6 common bank fees, and how to avoid them Bank fees can eat away at your balance and wipe out interest earnings. S Stephanie Colestock Updated Fri, February 20, 2026 at 4:05 PM CST 5 min read Bank accounts are important financial tools that help protect your money and even allow you to earn interest. But depending on where you bank — and how you use your account — certain fees can chip away at your balance. From monthly maintenance charges to overdraft penalties, these costs can add up quickly if you’re not paying attention. Understanding the most common bank fees, why financial institutions charge them, and how to avoid them can help you keep more of your money. Why do banks charge fees? Fees serve as added revenue for banks . If a bank charges a fee for account maintenance or an optional service, the institution can put those funds toward operational expenses and even generate additional income — at the customer’s expense. After all, a bank is a business, and a business’s goal is to earn money. Recent data shows that banks have become increasingly dependent on fees over the years, especially those charged for overdrafts and non-sufficient funds (NSF). In fact, according to the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB), NSF and overdraft fees account for about two-thirds of a typical bank’s fee-based revenue. 6 common bank fees to watch out for Even though consumer watchdog groups and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) are keeping a close eye on certain bank fees, it means that these added costs probably aren’t going to disappear anytime soon. You can often find ways to avoid these fees altogether based on the accounts you choose and how you manage them. 1. Monthly maintenance fees Monthly maintenance fees , also known as service fees, are commonly charged by banks to offset the administrative costs associated with servicing your account. They're commonly charged for checking accounts and can range from around $5 to $15, though they may be higher for premium accounts. How to avoid monthly fees Many banks waive maintenance fees if you meet certain requirements, such as: Maintaining a minimum balance Setting up direct deposit Making a minimum number of monthly transactions You can also consider switching to a no-fee checking account , or moving to an online bank where these charges are rare. 2. Overdraft fees An overdraft fee occurs when you spend more money than you have in your account and the bank covers the transaction. Overdrafts represent short-term credit risk for banks, so these fees compensate for covering the transaction and processing the negative balance. Overdraft fees can be steep, too, typically around $30 to $35 per transaction. How to avoid overdraft fees There are several steps you can take to avoid overdraft fees. First, you can opt out of overdraft coverage for debit card purchases. Instead of processing the transaction and covering the difference, the bank will simply decline any transactions that would put your balance in the red. You can also consider linking a savings account or line of credit to your checking account for overdraft protection (which usually incurs a fee as well, though it's often much less than an overdraft fee). It also helps to keep a small buffer in your checking account in case an unexpected transactions comes through, and set up bank alerts to notify you if your balance drops below a certain threshold. Read more: Can overdrafting affect your credit score? 3. ATM fees ATM fees typically occur when you use an out-of-network ATM. You may pay a fee from your bank, as well as an additional fee from the ATM operator. How to avoid ATM fees The easiest way to avoid ATM fees is to use in-network ATMs whenever possible. Another option is to choose a bank that reimburses ATM fees. 4. Excess transaction fees Some accounts — particularly savings and money market accounts — may charge fees if you exceed a certain number of withdrawals (usually six) during a statement cycle. These withdrawal limits are less common today, but many banks still have them in place. How to avoid excess transaction fees: If your bank charges fees for excessive withdrawals, it's important to plan your withdrawals carefully. Using a checking account for everyday transactions is the best bet. Then, consider making larger withdrawals or transfers from your savings when possible, rather than multiple smaller withdrawals throughout the month. You can usually rely on your mobile banking app to keep track of transactions. 5. Wire transfer fees Wire transfers are fast electronic transfers used to move money from one bank account to another. They're often used for large or time-sensitive payments. Domestic wires may cost around $15 to $30, while international wires can be even more expensive. How to avoid wire transfer fees: If the timing of your payment isn't urgent, consider using a free option such as an ACH transfer or fee-free payment app. Some banks also offer free wires — particularly premium and business accounts — including Marcus by Goldman Sachs and Fidelity. So, review your account agreement to find out if your bank charges this fee or consider switching to one that doesn't. Read more: 5 ways to transfer money from one bank to another 6. Foreign transaction fees Currency conversion and international payment processing create additional costs for financial institutions, which is why foreign transaction fees are common. These fees typically apply when you use your debit card for purchases made in a foreign currency or processed through a foreign bank. They’re usually around 1% to 3% of the transaction amount. How to avoid foreign transaction fees: When traveling abroad, always opt to pay in the local currency when given the choice. And if you travel internationally often, consider switching to a travel-friendly bank account that doesn't charge foreign transaction fees on debit transactions. Read more: Traveling internationally?

How do I know which fees my bank charges? Financial institutions are required by federal law to explicitly disclose any fees that are charged on depository or transactional accounts, such as your checking or savings account. These fees are typically outlined in an account disclosure, which you’ll receive — and perhaps even sign — when opening your account. You can also request a list of fees from the institution at any time. If these listed fees (or policies surrounding those fees) change in the future, the bank is required to send an updated disclosure outlining the new changes and how they may affect you.

(NYSE:ITW) to $275 from $244. The analyst reiterated an Underweight rating on the stock. He said the company’s outlook showed “some encouragement,” pointing to a few positive signs despite the cautious rating. Earlier, on February 3, Illinois Tool Works posted fourth-quarter results that came in ahead of Wall Street expectations. The company benefited from steady demand for automotive parts and its ongoing efforts to reduce the impact of tariffs. Investors responded positively, with the stock climbing about 5% in early trading. The company has been working to offset tariff pressure by shifting more production closer to its customers and introducing selective price increases. These steps helped improve operating margins across all seven of its business segments. At the same time, higher new vehicle prices have led many consumers to hold on to their cars longer, increasing demand for maintenance and repair services. This trend supported growth in the company’s automotive aftermarket business. The Automotive OEM segment, which remains the company’s largest revenue driver, brought in $827 million during the quarter, up from $785 million a year earlier. Overall, Illinois Tool Works reported earnings of $2.72 per share for the quarter ended December 31, compared with $2.54 per share last year. This result came in above analysts’ expectations of $2.68 per share, according to LSEG. Revenue also increased to $4.09 billion from $3.93 billion a year ago, slightly ahead of analyst estimates of $4.07 billion. Looking ahead, the company expects 2026 earnings per share to range between $11 and $11.4. However, the midpoint of this forecast is slightly below analysts’ current estimate of $11.26 per share. Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW) is a diversified global manufacturer serving multiple industries. Its business includes Automotive OEM, Food Equipment, Test & Measurement and Electronics, Welding, Polymers & Fluids, Construction Products, and Specialty Products. While we acknowledge the potential of ITW as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "content": "Investors Have WING. Do They Need a Prayer? Thomas Hughes, MarketBeat Fri, February 20, 2026 at 4:41 PM CST 4 min read WING Wingstop branded takeout bag and sauced wings inside restaurant, highlighting earnings rebound in fast-casual dining. Key Points Wingstop is on track to accelerate growth in 2026 and sustain a robust capital return. High debt is offset by cash flow, coverage, and growth. Analysts are raising targets, leading this market toward record highs. Interested in Wingstop Inc.? Here are five stocks we like better. Wingstop (NASDAQ: WING) investors’ prayers were answered with the Q4 2025 earnings release and 2026 guidance. Not only were the Q4 comps better than expected, but margin strength shone through, and the guidance affirmed an outlook for acceleration. As it stands, the company forecasts low-single-digit domestic comp and 15% global store count growth, which, aided by last year’s 20% increase in store count, suggests the consensus forecast could be too low. → Draganfly’s CEO Says Drones Are Becoming Intelligence Platforms—Not Just Hardware The likely outcome is that the price rebound the news catalyzed is just the beginning of a much larger movement that could take this stock back to record levels, as an outperformance/bullish-revision cycle is in place. The analyst activity leading up to the release was bullish, including upgrades and price target revisions up to the day before the release. Analyst coverage increased, even while share prices declined. The consensus Moderate Buy rating is strengthening, and price targets are narrowing around the consensus, which forecasts solid over 20% upside from the critical support level. A move to the consensus would be significant, as it would be a six-month high, putting the market on track to retest all-time highs later in the year. → DTE’s Stargate Deal Turns Power Into Profits WING chart displaying the stock consolidating and poised to take flight. Wingstop Leans Into Store Count Growth Wingstop struggled with weak domestic comps in Q4 and 2025, but offset it with store count growth. The results were an 8.6% year-over-year (YOY) revenue gain on a systemwide 9.3% sales increase, despite the 5.8% decline in domestic comps. → PayPal Is Back Near IPO-Era Prices—Value Setup or Value Trap? Store count increased by 124 in the quarter, up 20% on a full-year basis, and is expected to remain strong in the upcoming year, improving operational leverage for when consumer habits shift. Digital is another factor of interest, up nearly 75%, revealing the effectiveness of the Smart Kitchen idea. Wingstop’s Smart Kitchen is an AI-powered tool that organizes and prioritizes off-premise orders, reducing ticket times by up to 50%. Margin was among the catalysts for stock price action. Investors had expected margin pressures but were relieved at the result. While adjusted net income was relatively flat compared to last year, adjusted EBITDA improved approximately 950 basis points, and both were well above forecasts. More importantly, the bottom-line $1 in adjusted EPS outperformed by more than 1500 basis points and guidance for the current year is solid. Story Continues Aggressive Capital Return Underpins Wingstop’s Stock Price Outlook Wingstop uses debt to fund its growth strategy and is considered moderately to highly levered. However, its margin strength and cash flow enable coverage alongside capital returns, which are aggressively aiding shareholders. The dividend yield isn’t substantial, just under 0.5% as of mid-February, but it is reliable at under 30% of earnings, and the distribution is expected to be increased at a double-digit pace in upcoming years. The buyback plans are more substantial , having reduced the share count approximately 4.9% on average in Q4 and 4.4% for the fiscal year. The only downside is negative equity, but again, it is offset by the company’s healthy cash flow and growth outlook. In this scenario, the deficit may continue to grow as the share count rapidly falls. Institutional activity reveals the group buying into the growth, cash flow, and capital return outlook. MarketBeat data reflects a bullish balance for six consecutive quarters, including Q1 2026. Activity ramped to historical highs in 2025 as WING’s price fell, and is on track to set a record in Q1 2026, underpinning the stock price action. Institutions provide a solid support base by owning nearly 100% of the shares and offer a robust tailwind with their buying activity. The biggest risk for investors is the short interest, which is relatively high at 14%. Short sellers may cap gains, but the more likely outcome is that short covering will begin, helping lift price action over time. Wingstop Confirms Bottom With February Price Action Wingstop’s price action fell to long-term lows ahead of the release and rebounded strongly in its wake . The signal reflects support at a critical level, aligns with prior lows, and indicates a high potential for a rebound. The move took the market above the cluster of EMAs, which is now the critical support level. Assuming support remains solid at this level, WING shares will likely move up into the $320 to $360 range, in line with analyst estimates, ahead of the Q1 2026 earnings release scheduled for mid-spring.

Both share classes of the company enjoyed a roughly 4% rise on the day, comparing very favorably to the 0.7% increase of the bellwether S&P 500 index. Much of this stemmed from a media report on the tech sector giant. Chipping away That afternoon, The Wall Street Journal published an article stating that Google is planning to, in the newspaper's words, \"expand the market for its artificial intelligence (AI) chips.\" It aims to do this by widening its existing AI efforts to better compete with the current AI hardware king, Nvidia . Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » Image source: Getty Images. Citing unnamed \"people familiar with the matter,\" the Journal wrote that the core Alphabet business unit is providing increased financial support to data center partners. This, theoretically, will bolster AI deployment and implementation, and hopefully the company's AI revenue. Management also aims to provide funding to AI-adjacent businesses. The newspaper added that, according to its sources, the company is currently in discussions to invest roughly $100 million in an early stage \"neocloud\" company, Fluidstack. \"Neocloud\" is a recently minted term for a specialist that focuses on providing cloud computing services to AI developers. More than just a search engine Although there has been some skepticism from the investing community about the often sky-high valuations of some AI companies, it's undeniable that demand for the technology is intense -- and likely to remain so. Alphabet is one of the rare companies with vast amounts of capital to spend on building out its AI offerings, and the know-how to turn them into gushing revenue streams. I feel that investors were right to be bullish on these apparent developments. Should you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

(NYSE: CHD ) is included among the 16 Best Dividend Stocks with Rising Payouts . Church & Dwight (CHD) Gets Upgrade from Rothschild & Co Redburn on More Attractive Valuation On February 13, Rothschild & Co Redburn analyst Edward Lewis upgraded Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) to Neutral from Sell. The analyst also raised his price target to $91 from $81 on the stock. He explained that the firm’s earlier cautious view was based on expectations that growth would slow, which did not seem fully reflected in the stock’s premium valuation at the time. With the valuation now more reasonable, the firm said it had become more comfortable with the shares. Earlier, on January 30, Church & Dwight reported quarterly results that came in ahead of Wall Street expectations. The company benefited from steady demand across both affordable and premium household products, including laundry detergent and personal care items. This steady demand helped support earnings even as consumer conditions remained uneven. The company also said it expects its gross margin to expand by about 100 basis points in 2026 compared with last year. That outlook reflects ongoing efforts to improve efficiency and strengthen profitability. Consumer goods companies across the US have been adjusting to a more cautious consumer environment. Inflation remains elevated, and economic uncertainty has made shoppers more selective. In response, companies like Church & Dwight have focused on product innovation, increased promotions, and more aggressive marketing to maintain sales momentum. Over the past year, Church & Dwight has reshaped its business. It exited several slower-growing areas, including dietary supplements, Flawless grooming tools, and Waterpik showerhead products. These moves allowed the company to focus more on categories with stronger growth potential, particularly those that offer both value and premium options. The company reported adjusted earnings of 86 cents per share for the fourth quarter, ahead of analysts’ estimate of 84 cents per share, according to LSEG data.CEO Rick Dierker said the company’s balanced mix of value and premium products, along with disciplined operations, helped it gain market share in several categories. This progress came even as the broader consumer and economic environment remained mixed. Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) develops, manufactures, and sells a range of household and personal care products. It also operates in specialty areas related to animal and food production, as well as chemicals and cleaning products. While we acknowledge the potential of CHD as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.
