      "content": "1 Brilliant Vanguard Index Fund to Buy Before It Soars 25%, According to Wall Street Analysts David Dierking, The Motley Fool Fri, February 20, 2026 at 9:20 AM PST 3 min read NVDA INTC For the first time in more than three years, investors are giving an extended look to areas of the market beyond tech. Energy and consumer staples are among the best-performing sectors this year. Value and dividend stocks have made a comeback. International equities have been on a tear since the beginning of 2025. Another category that's had a strong start to the year is small caps. Long unloved and ignored, they're getting attention for their comparatively small exposure to tech and attractive valuations. The Russell 2000, a generally accepted benchmark for small caps, is receiving some eye-catching price targets from analysts. Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » The ETF Action database, which compiles price targets for companies within a particular ETF, currently has a 25% 12-month upside target for the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF (NASDAQ: VTWO) . Let's break down the investment case for this fund heading into the remainder of 2026. Image source: Getty Images. Why Wall Street is turning bullish on small caps again Even though small caps are considered riskier and have more boom/bust potential than large caps , there comes a point where the value and the narrative are impossible to ignore. For example: Valuation concerns about megacaps, potential rate cuts, and a deregulation tailwind would all benefit small caps. Currently, the Russell 2000 is expected  to grow 2026 earnings by 19% compared to a 13% growth forecast for the S&P 500 . The Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF has a price/earnings (P/E) ratio of 18 versus 28 for the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF . It's not often that the value and growth stories both line up for small caps, but that's happening now. And the market has begun to recognize it. Why the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF is positioned for the next leg Megacaps have dominated the U.S. equity market for years, but concentration risk is beginning to rise. The same \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that have pulled the major market averages higher are all down year-to-date as of Feb. 13, and they're all down more than 10% from their all-time highs. Tech has become an anchor this year. Small companies tend to disproportionately benefit from lower interest rates because many carry higher debt loads. Current rate-cut expectations are modest, but any unexpected disinflation, growth, or labor market shock could quickly have the Federal Reserve thinking about more rate cuts. Story Continues But if the U.S. economy can maintain a \"soft landing\" or \"no landing\" outcome, small caps could find additional momentum. For years, investors were interested only in the growth stories being offered by large-cap and megacap stocks. The next phase of the market cycle could finally reward the small caps.

Q4 revenue climbed 12% year-over-year to $1.1 billion, driven by a 17% surge in order entries across the banking and retail sectors. The company’s strategic focus on modular retail solutions and ATM recycling technology has led to significant market gains, including nine new major retail logos in the US grocery and pharmacy sectors. While operating expenses rose by 3.7% due to labor costs and investments in service infrastructure, management noted that the rollout of new field service software is largely complete, positioning the company for margin expansion starting in Q2 2026. Despite a slight decline in retail margins caused by external cyber-related disruptions, the banking segment remains robust with strong branch automation demand in North America and a recovery expected in Latin America. Diebold Nixdorf enters 2026 with a solid $730 million product backlog and anticipates revenue growth to be weighted toward H2 of the year. The CEO emphasized that the company remains disciplined in its capital allocation, prioritizing shareholder returns through buybacks while evaluating tuck-in acquisitions that could immediately bolster its service capabilities and global footprint.

(NASDAQ: RELY ) is one of the best new tech stocks to invest in now . On February 18, Remitly Global recorded revenue of $1.635 billion in the full year 2025, which was a 29% increase year-over-year. Q4 was particularly strong with $442 million in revenue and $41 million in net income, driven by a 19% increase in active users to over 9 million. A significant highlight was the surge in high-value transactions, with volume from very high amount senders skyrocketing 105% in the quarter. The company is undergoing a major leadership transition as co-founder Matt Oppenheimer steps into the role of Executive Chairman, passing the CEO mantle to former Amazon and Apple executive Sebastian Gunningham. This shift comes as Remitly scales its product ecosystem through new offerings like Flex, which is a send-now-pay-later service that has already surpassed 120,000 users. Furthermore, the launch of Remitly Business and the integration of advanced AI fraud models have improved operational efficiency, leading to record-low transaction losses and a tripled free cash flow of $283 million for the year.

On February 4, Ralliant reported Q4 2025 revenue of $555 million, which was only a 1% increase year-over-year but exceeded company guidance. Growth was uneven across segments: while the Communications division surged by 29% and Sensors & Safety Systems grew 6%, the Test & Measurement segment saw a 6% decline as customers remained cautious with capital expenditure. The company faced a significant financial setback during the quarter, recording a $1.4 billion non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to its EA Elektro-Automatik business. Management attributed this write-down to a cooling in EV demand and shifts in global subsidies. Additionally, Ralliant is navigating structural cost headwinds following its recent spin-off, which are expected to impact adjusted EBITDA margins by 250 basis points in 2026. Ralliant issued full-year revenue guidance of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.22 to $2.42 for 2026. While the Test & Measurement segment is expected to remain at the lower end of growth expectations, the company remains committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy that balances organic investment in AI and digital platforms with strategic tuck-in acquisitions.

DATE Friday, Feb. 20, 2026 at 11 a.m. ET CALL PARTICIPANTS President and Chief Executive Officer — Katherine Holt Antonello Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer — Michael Aldo Pedraja Full Conference Call Transcript Katherine Holt Antonello: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2025 earnings call. Joining me is Michael Aldo Pedraja, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, I will begin by providing highlights of our fourth quarter 2025 results and then hand it over to Michael for more details on our financials. Before our Q&A, I will come back to you with some additional thoughts. I would like to begin with how we are actively addressing the elevated frequency of California cumulative trauma claims. To be clear, this remains a California-specific issue. Claim frequency in our other states and within non-CT claims in California continues to trend favorably. We recognized early that the CT environment was creating a hard market in California, and we moved decisively, have implemented rate increases, and tightened underwriting on several classes of business. We are not waiting for legislative reform, though we do believe the growing impact on California businesses and public budgets will make the case for reform increasingly difficult to ignore. While we are confident that these California pricing and underwriting actions, along with the steps we are taking across the country, will strengthen our underwriting profitability, they are also likely to reduce written premium in 2026. It is worth highlighting that our small commercial franchise maintained strong retention rates throughout 2025, a clear sign the investments we have made in automation and ease of use are genuinely resonating. I am also pleased to report that our standard fourth quarter full actuarial assessment concluded that no additional reserve strengthening or adjustments to our current accident year loss and LAE ratio was necessary. In addition to our internal analysis, we engaged a market-leading actuarial firm to independently assess our estimated ultimate loss, and they concluded that our carried reserves were well within the range of reasonable estimates. We believe the outcome of these two analyses confirms the actions we took in the third quarter adequately addressed recent workers’ compensation trends. I am excited to discuss our new workers’ compensation product, which represents a strategic expansion of our capabilities. By leveraging our core workers’ compensation expertise into the excess layer, we are creating new growth avenues while diversifying our risk profile. Our aggressive adoption of AI tools has accelerated the product’s development, and I am pleased to report that we are now accepting submissions. The early market response has been strong, and we expect this product will deepen our distribution partner relationships while expanding our addressable market. Story Continues We continued to execute on our commitment to returning capital to stockholders by delivering $215,000,000 of share repurchases and regular quarterly dividends in 2025. In January, we completed the $125,000,000 capital recapitalization plan that we announced in the third quarter. These capital management steps reflect our continued confidence in our financial position and our commitment to delivering value to shareholders. Along with our operational performance, these actions increased our book value per share, including the gain, by 11% to $51.31. We believe our focus on disciplined underwriting, prudent risk management, and strategic investments continues to position us strongly in the workers’ compensation insurance market, which is evidenced by A.M. Best’s recent reaffirmation of our insurance companies’ financial strength rating of A. With that, Michael will now provide a deeper dive into our fourth quarter financial results, and then I will return to provide my closing remarks. Michael? Michael Aldo Pedraja: Thank you, Katherine. Gross premiums written were $156,800,000 compared to $176,300,000 for the prior-year quarter, a decrease of 11% due primarily to a decrease in new business writings and lower final audit premiums, partially offset by higher renewal business premium. Our losses and LAE were $134,400,000 versus $113,200,000 a year ago, an increase of 18.7% due primarily to an increase in the accident year 2025 selected loss and LAE ratio and the absence of favorable developments in the fourth quarter of this year. Commission expense was $25,800,000 for the quarter versus $24,400,000 for the prior year, an increase of 5.7% driven by nonrecurring adjustments. Underwriting expenses were $39,800,000 for the quarter versus $44,200,000 for the prior year, a decrease of 10%. The improvement in underwriting expenses for the fourth quarter was due primarily to continued expense management efforts, including reduced personnel costs and other variable costs, such as policyholder dividends and bad debt. Net investment income was $31,400,000 for the quarter compared to $26,700,000 for the prior year, an increase of 17.6%, due mostly to private equity investment return distributions and an overall higher book yield on our fixed income portfolio. As Katherine mentioned, we executed an investment rebalancing to address several strategic goals, including reducing our equity investment allocation to target levels and increasing our overall portfolio yield. Our equity investments, like most in the market, have appreciated very nicely and reached 16% of our investment portfolio versus a target allocation of approximately 10%. As part of the investment rebalancing, we also sold low-yielding fixed income securities to offset the associated equity gains and redeploy the proceeds into higher-yielding fixed income investments. The investment rebalancing accomplished several goals, including reducing our equity investments to target allocation, increasing our overall investment portfolio yield by a net 40 basis points, extracting an estimated net present value gain of $16,000,000, and reducing our required capital. The sale of fixed income investments produced an after-tax realized loss of $40,000,000, which reduced net income and adjusted book value per share during the quarter. Our stockholders’ equity and book value per share were not impacted by the investment rebalancing. Our fixed maturities maintain a modified duration of 4.4 with strong average credit quality of A+. Aided by our investment rebalancing, our weighted average book yield increased to 4.9% at quarter end compared to 4.5% for the prior year. Our adjusted net income, which excludes net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses and the benefit of our LPT deferred gain amortization, was $14,500,000 for the quarter, compared to $28,700,000 last year. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased almost 2,400,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $40.94 per share, or $97,000,000. The average repurchase price represented a 20% discount to our book value per share, including the deferred gain, and adjusted book value per share. During the period from January 1 through February 18 of this year, the company repurchased a further 898,594 shares of its common stock at an average price of $44.28 per share. Our remaining share repurchase authorization is $53,100,000. As we have highlighted, we aim to be good stewards of our shareholders’ capital. At current price levels, we are convinced that the Employers Holdings, Inc. stock is meaningfully undervalued, and executing share repurchases at these price levels produces a significant return on investment and generates significant value for our continuing shareholders. I will now turn the call back to Katherine. Katherine Holt Antonello: Thank you, Michael. Yesterday, our Boa",

(NYSE: FIG ) is one of the best new tech stocks to invest in now . On February 18, Figma reported the financial results for Q4 2025, with revenue reaching $304 million, marking a 40% increase year-over-year. For the full year, the company surpassed $1 billion, generating $1.056 billion in total revenue. This growth was supported by a net dollar retention rate of 136% among customers with over $10,000 in ARR and international expansion, which grew 45% compared to the previous year. The company is prioritizing AI-native functionality to drive user engagement and expand its customer base. The CEO highlighted the success of Figma Make and the integration of AI credits, noting that 75% of large customers are already using these credits weekly. However, Figma also anticipates that its non-GAAP operating margin will decrease from 12% in 2025 to 8% in 2026. This is attributed to increased investments in AI infrastructure, elevated stock-based compensation following its IPO, and the costs associated with transitioning to a hybrid monetization model involving both seats and AI credits.

      "content": "Tax refunds are big this year, IRS data show. Here's how big. Medora Lee, USA TODAY Fri, February 20, 2026 at 9:13 AM PST 4 min read The number of tax returns the IRS has received so far this tax season is down from last year, but refunds are up double digits, IRS data show. The average refund through Feb. 6 was $2,290, up nearly 11% from $2,065 at the same time in 2025 while total returns received fell 5.2%. The IRS noted refund numbers should rise further, too, as refunds claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) are required by law to be held until Feb. 15. These “refund numbers do not include millions of EITC and ACTC refunds to these taxpayers,” the agency said in its release. “This means the refund numbers expected to be released Feb. 27, for refunds processed through Feb. 20, are expected to be higher.” That should be encouraging news to Americans who are struggling under the weight of elevated prices and a slowing job market , analysts said. “Higher refunds should be a tailwind for consumers, particularly lower income consumers who use tax refunds for debt paydown and big-ticket purchases,” said Mihir Bhatia, analyst at Bank of America. Average refunds are big. How to get mine faster? \"Combining direct deposit with electronic filing is the fastest way to receive your refund ,\" the IRS said. Most refunds are issued in less than 21 days for taxpayers who filed a flawless return electronically and chose direct deposit. Nine out of 10 taxpayers already receive their tax refunds by direct deposit, but to boost that closer to 100%, the IRS began phasing out paper checks last September. \"Paper checks are over 16 times more likely to be lost, stolen, altered, or delayed than electronic payments,\" the IRS said. \"Direct deposit also avoids the possibility that a refund check could be returned to the IRS as undeliverable.\" How do I know when my refund’s coming? Through the IRS \" Where's My Refund \" tool, you can track when the IRS received your tax return, when it approved a refund and when it issued the refund. The money should land in your account within five days from the date the IRS approves your refund. If you mailed a paper return and expect a refund, it could take four weeks or more to process your return, the IRS said. Since refunds for Americans who claimed the EITC/ACTC can’t be released until mid-February for early filers , those taxpayers may have to wait until around March 3 to see their refunds in their bank accounts or on debit cards, if they chose direct deposit and there are no issues with the tax return. If you don’t have a bank account, find one through the FDIC website or the National Credit Union Administration using their Credit Union Locator Tool . Usually, people can open a b a nk account pretty quickly. You can also ask your tax preparer if they offer other electronic payment options. Story Continues Otherwise, you might be able to deposit your refund onto a reloadable prepaid debit card or mobile app. Many reloadable prepaid cards and mobile apps have routing and account numbers, which may be different from the card number. Check with your financial institution to make sure your card or app can receive the deposit and double-check the routing and account numbers. Tax filers saw $172.26 billion in federal income tax refunds head their way through March 24. While that's a great deal of money, the total dollar amount is down $16.4 billion or down 8.7% from a year ago. Tax refunds How should people use their tax refunds? Along with that big check comes big responsibility, so make sure not to spend it all away , financial experts said. Here are some ideas : Since refunds are expected to be larger than usual , splitting a refund can be a convenient way to manage your money. You can split the refund in any proportion you want, sending some to an account for immediate use and some for future savings, in up to three different accounts with U.S. financial institutions, reloadable prepaid debit cards, or mobile apps.  You can use your tax software to do it electronically or use IRS Form 8888, Allocation of Refund if you file a paper return. Plan how to use the refund before receiving it. This “reduces overspending risk by assigning the refund a job in advance -- debt payoff, emergency savings, or essential expenses,” said Paul Ricci, chief executive of personal loans site Best Egg. Put debt reduction and financial health ahead of lifestyle upgrades. “Applying refunds toward high-interest balances can reduce financial stress and improve credit utilization,” Ricci said. “Prioritizing emergency savings – 3 to 6 months of expenses -- helps prevent future reliance on credit when unexpected costs arise.” Medora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

(NASDAQ: NXT ) is one of the best new tech stocks to invest in now . On February 17, Nextpower announced a multi-year supply agreement with Jinko Solar (US) Industries Inc. to provide gigawatt-scale steel solar module frames. Under the terms of the deal, Nextpower will supply at least 1 GW of steel frames, with the potential to scale up to 3 GW over three years. These components will support Jinko Solar’s manufacturing operations at its Jacksonville, Florida facility, with production slated to begin in mid-2026. To support this partnership and further localize its supply chain, Nextpower Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT) intends to expand its manufacturing capacity in the Southeastern US to simplify logistics for direct supply to Jinko Solar’s Florida plant. This move follows Nextpower’s recent growth in Memphis and contributes to a network of over 25 US factories that the company has established or expanded since 2021 to meet the rising demand for domestic solar components. The transition to steel frames offers structural and financial advantages for the solar industry. Independent testing indicates that steel frames provide superior durability and stiffness compared to traditional materials for reliability in extreme weather. Furthermore, using US-made steel frames allows developers to add six percent to a tracker project’s domestic content calculation, helping them align with US Treasury Department guidance and national manufacturing priorities.

Is it possible to achieve a perfect credit score of 850? In short, yes — but it may not be necessary. Yahoo Personal Finance · Getty Images Sarah C. Brady · Contributor Updated Fri, February 20, 2026 at 9:07 AM PST 5 min read For the last couple of years, the average credit score for U.S. adults has been right around 715. If you're a perfectionist, a 715 score might not seem high enough, since most popular scoring models range up to a maximum of 850. But is it even possible to obtain an 850 score? According to FICO, it is. However, it's incredibly rare; less than 2% of the population has perfect credit scores. Even for me — a former NFCC-certified credit counselor and a credit expert — 850 has been out of reach so far. This year, my FICO 8 score reached a high of 842. With that said, I'm in no rush to hit an 850, and you shouldn't be either. Why? Other than the ego boost, there's no benefit to having perfect scores. In fact, once you're in the high 700s, your credit score already qualifies you for the best credit cards and loans available on the market. What is a perfect credit score, and is it possible to achieve? The most widely used credit scoring model is FICO , which ranges from 300 to 850. A perfect 850 credit score is achievable, but most of the population will never have scores that high. According to the most recent available data, only around 1.7% of U.S. adults have FICO scores of 850. The group most likely to achieve score perfection is older adults, since they have the benefit of longer credit histories and more financial stability, both of which help build high scores. Does that mean you have to wait for retirement to build excellent credit? Definitely not! In 2016, FICO highlighted a case of a 43-year-old who was, at that time, the youngest person who had an \"exceptional\" credit score (800 or higher). I suspect many 30-somethings have joined those ranks since then, considering that the average credit score for U.S. adults has risen by almost 20 points since then. As for myself, I'm currently 42, and my scores have been in the 800s for about 10 years now. Of course, I had the advantage of working as a credit counselor in my early 30s, a job that involved reviewing credit reports every day and teaching workshops about credit scores. How can I get an 850 credit score? Again, there's really no payoff for obtaining perfect 850 credit scores. However, if you insist on aiming for perfection, there are some key ways to improve your chances. According to FICO, \"high achievers\" — or people with credit scores of 795 and higher — have these traits in common: No missed debt payments on their credit reports Credit card balances stay under 5% of their credit limits Oldest average debt account is 30 years old I've also picked up a few tricks for accelerating credit score growth over my years of studying credit reports and scores. Depending on your situation, you may be able to replicate some or all of them: Became an authorized user: To kick-start my credit profile, I asked a family member to add me to her oldest credit card as an authorized user . By doing so, my scores benefited from her positive history with the credit card. Got my own card : After gaining about 80 points in a year, I applied for my own credit card (I now have two in total). Annual limit increases: I make sure to request limit increases on my credit cards at least once a year. I do this directly through my creditors' apps to avoid a hard inquiry that would lower my scores. When my limits are increased, it helps lower my credit utilization ratio and usually increases my scores by a few points. Make bi-weekly payment : Last year, I switched from paying off my credit card balances once a month to paying them off bi-weekly, which keeps my credit utilization low. This change helped me gain about eight points. Related: The best rewards credit cards Does an 850 credit score matter? Having an 850 credit score doesn't benefit you in any tangible way. You don't need an 850 to qualify for the best loan interest rates and terms, nor do you need it to qualify for hard-to-get rewards credit cards. For practical purposes, anything above an 800 can essentially be considered perfect, but FICO even considers scores as low as 670 to be good credit scores . So if you're concerned about improving your scores, try not to focus so much on a number that feels symbolically important, like the \"perfect\" 850. Instead, pinpoint what you plan to do with your credit in the next year or two, and check to see if improvements to your scores or other areas of your finances would be beneficial. For example, let's say you want to qualify for a mortgage. You can qualify for a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan with credit scores as low as 500, as long as you save at least 10% for your down payment. For conventional loans , most lenders will approve you for their lowest interest rates with scores of 760 or higher, and you won't have to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI) if your down payment is at least 20%. Average credit score by age: How do your scores compare? 6 benefits of a good credit score Introducing TruVision: A new tool that uses your banking data to generate a credit score Frequently asked questions about 850 credit scores Can you go higher than an 850 credit score? It's possible to have a credit score above 850, since some credit scoring models, such as FICO Auto Score and FICO Bankcard Score, use a range up to 900. However, these scores aren’t commonly used by lenders, and there’s no practical benefit of having scores above 850. Is 780 a good credit score? A 780 credit score is considered very good if the scoring range goes up to 850. Having scores of 780 or higher can help you qualify for the best available offers on credit cards and loans.

What is a good credit score? Yahoo Personal Finance · Getty Images J Jess Ullrich Updated Fri, February 20, 2026 at 9:06 AM PST 4 min read Good credit can open many doors for you, including lower interest rates and an easier time getting approved for credit cards or loans . But what counts as a \"good\" credit score depends on the scoring model. The most common credit scoring models are FICO® Score and VantageScore®, and while they’re similar, there are some distinct differences between the two. Here’s what to know if you’re wondering about good credit scores and why building your credit is a worthy endeavor. What is a good credit score? Credit scoring models have different ranges and formulas, which means \"good\" credit varies depending on the company providing your score. Here’s how the scoring models differ. How the FICO Score works The FICO scoring model considers these factors when determining your credit scores: Payment history : Your payment history accounts for 35% of your FICO score, so prioritizing on-time and in-full payments is crucial. Amounts owed : Amounts owed, or your total debt relative to your available credit, also make up a significant portion of your FICO score — 30%. Length of credit history : The length, or average age, of your credit history accounts for 15% of your FICO score. A longer history is generally better. Credit mix : Credit mix, or the types of credit you have, makes up 10% of your FICO score. A healthy mix of various credit types is generally better. New credit : New credit, or any accounts you’ve opened recently, account for 10% of your FICO score. FICO scores can range from 300 to 850, with 850 being the best possible credit score you can have. Good credit under the FICO model falls within the 670 to 739 range, while anything above that is considered very good or excellent. Related: The best secured credit cards to build credit How the VantageScore works The VantageScore 4.0 model considers these factors when determining your credit scores: Payment history : As with FICO, your payment history plays a major role in your VantageScore, accounting for 41% of your score. Depth of credit : VantageScore combines both the age of your credit history and your credit mix into one scoring factor, which makes up 20% of your score. Utilization : The amount of available credit you’re using accounts for 20% of your VantageScore. New credit : Recent applications for new credit make up 11% of your VantageScore. Balances : VantageScore also considers your current balances, which account for 6% of your score. Available credit : Available credit makes up 2% of your VantageScore. Like FICO scores, VantageScores range from 300 to 850, with a good VantageScore falling in the 661 to 780 range. Anything above that is considered \"super prime,\" or excellent. Why is good credit important? It can take time to build good credit, but it’s worth the wait. Good credit has several benefits, including more plentiful choices for housing, credit cards, and lenders. Property managers, credit card companies, and lenders will view you as less of a risk if your credit is good. Property managers typically look at your credit when you apply for a new apartment, and a stronger credit history means they may be more likely to approve your application. Likewise, when you apply for a loan or new credit line, your lender or credit card issuer will conduct a hard credit pull and review your credit history and scores. Applicants with better credit are more likely to get approved for financing, and they’re also more likely to get lower rates. Depending on your state, your credit could also affect your insurance rates.

Make payments on time and in full Your payment history has a major impact on both your FICO Score and VantageScore. If you’ve missed a credit card payment before or paid a loan late, focus on developing stronger payment habits. A history of responsible payments could result in better credit. 2. Focus on paying down debt Likewise, you’ll also want to focus on paying down your existing debt, especially if you’re using a large portion of your available credit. Ideally, your credit utilization should be under 30%, but the lower it is, the better. Amounts owed and credit utilization play a big role in your credit scores.

Each time you open a new credit account, your card issuer or lender pulls your credit, which causes a slight dip in your score. Opening several new accounts right before applying for an important loan or new card could make you a higher-risk borrower in the eyes of creditors. The best credit cards to build credit 4. Pay attention to your credit mix Having a healthy credit mix , or multiple types of credit and loan accounts, may work in your favor. It shows you’re able to manage multiple account types successfully. Both credit age and mix have a fairly significant impact on your credit score. Improving your credit translates to more — and often better — opportunities. Whether you’re looking for a new apartment, insurance policy, loan, or credit card, a good or excellent FICO or VantageScore could mean lower rates and more options. Fortunately, if your credit needs work, you can improve it. This article was edited by Alicia Hahn .

      "content": "Why Copart Stock Dropped Today Rich Smith, The Motley Fool Fri, February 20, 2026 at 9:09 AM PST 2 min read CPRT NVDA INTC Junked-car salvager Copart (NASDAQ: CPRT) stock fell 4.5% through 11:30 a.m. ET Friday after missing earnings last night. Heading into its fiscal Q2 2026 report, analysts forecast Copart to earn $0.39 per share on $1.15 billion in sales. In fact, Copart earned just $0.36 per share on sales of $1.12 billion. Will AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue » Image source: Getty Images. Copart Q2 earnings Copart revenues slipped 4% year over year in Q2, resulting in a 10% decline in per-share profit, worsening a decline that began in Q1. Year to date, Copart's sales are down 1%, and earnings are flat against fiscal 2025 at $0.77 per share. That's the bad news. The good news is that Copart's free cash flow is up significantly this year. Although operating cash flow was basically unchanged year over year at $662.8 million, Copart cut its purchases of property and equipment nearly in half, to just $177.7 million. As a result, free cash flow so far this year is a strong $485.1 million -- and trending toward perhaps $970 million through the end of the fiscal year! Is Copart stock a buy? Copart management didn't give much in the way of guidance, but assuming Copart can hit that mark, the stock would be trading for a price-to-free cash flow ratio of 37.4. Back out $5.1 billion in net cash on the balance sheet, and the EV/FCF ratio on this one falls to just 32.1. I can't call the stock a \"buy\" at this valuation -- not with profits flat and revenues falling. But there's no doubt Copart stock is getting cheaper, and it's already a lot cheaper than it was a year ago. Should you buy stock in Copart right now? Before you buy stock in Copart, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Copart wasn’t one of them.
