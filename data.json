      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT For two decades, few corners of global finance were lonelier than the market for Japanese government bonds. Under the Bank of Japan’s longstanding regime of keeping borrowing costs pinned at zero, yields on the securities, known as J.G.B.s, largely flatlined. Over the years, the few contrarian investors willing to bet that yields might eventually rise were burned so badly that the trade was named the “widow-maker.” In the world’s second-largest government bond market, entire days would pass without a single benchmark bond changing hands. Those days are gone. Last month, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s vow to cut taxes sparked anxiety over Tokyo’s ability to service its staggering $9 trillion debt. Yields on the 30-year government bond surged more than a quarter percentage point in a single session, an enormous move in a market where daily changes are typically measured only in hundredths of a point. The volatility was so profound that Scott Bessent, the U.S. Treasury secretary, called his counterparts in Tokyo seeking reassurances to help steady global markets rattled by the moves. Yields, a benchmark for borrowing costs, jumped again last week after Ms. Takaichi’s party won in a landslide election, which investors viewed as a mandate for her high-spending agenda. For the broader Japanese economy, the spike signals a potentially grim slide. If yields continue their ascent, some economists and investors warn that Japan risks falling into a “debt trap” — a vicious cycle in which rising interest costs consume so much of the national budget that the government must borrow even more just to pay the interest. But for J.G.B.s and their veteran traders, the recent movements have generated a return to a level of fervor not seen in decades. After a prolonged professional hibernation, a rare class of traders and strategists — most now in their 60s or older — are finding themselves back in the limelight as global investment firms seek to tap their experience in navigating an environment of actual, moving interest rates. “It’s becoming a ‘battlefield’ again,” said Hiroyuki Kubota, 67, who dealt Japanese government bonds 40 years ago and has since written several books on the securities. “It’s just like the old days.” Image Hiroyuki Kubota, a veteran of the Japanese government bond market going back decades, said the recent fluctuations in yields reminded him of “the old days.” Credit... Kentaro Takahashi for The New York Times Mr. Kubota began dealing the bonds in 1986, just after a series of reforms meaningfully opened Japan’s government debt markets to global investors. At the time, Nomura Securities, the king of Japan’s bubble-era finance, was hosting boozy, dayslong annual cherry blossom seminars in Kyoto to pitch government bonds to overseas central bankers. The market was booming. In the 1980s and 1990s, yields shifted rapidly alongside fluctuations in Japan’s overall economy. Yields on 10-year bonds doubled from 4 percent in 1989 to 8 percent in 1990, before falling back to 5 percent by 1992. Investors rushed to profit from the swings. After J.G.B. futures — contracts to buy or sell bonds at a later date — were introduced in 1985, they quickly became the world’s most heavily traded bond futures. “It was a party,” said Hiromi Yamaji, 70, chief executive of the Japan Exchange Group, recalling the annual Kyoto gatherings of the 1980s. Before assuming his current post at the operator of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Mr. Yamaji spent 36 years at Nomura. J.G.B.s “were a very lucrative product,” he said. “Everybody was trading them a lot.” At the time, traders were being wooed by the likes of Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers, which were expanding their presence in Tokyo. Top-tier strategists could command compensation packages in the millions of dollars as American firms sought to poach talent from traditional Japanese banks. Mr. Kubota, the former J.G.B. dealer, started a website in the late 1990s featuring a chat room that he said had attracted market movers and officials from Japan’s Ministry of Finance. He hosted annual parties on a traditional Japanese houseboat, where the elite of the bond world would talk shop while cruising the Sumida River in central Tokyo. Recent swings in yields “may have been a shock to those who only knew the last 20 years,” Mr. Kubota said. “But to those who know the old days, they aren’t strange at all.” Image In the years since Mr. Kubota started dealing government bonds in the 1980s, he has become one of Japan’s best-known bond watchers and has written several books on the subject. Credit... via Hiroyuki Kubota Paralysis began to set in for Japanese government bonds around the turn of the century. After the bursting of the Japanese asset bubble and the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the Bank of Japan in 1999 became the first major central bank in recent memory to lower interest rates to zero. As the central bank began buying bonds to force rates down, the 10-year yield hit a record low of less than 0.5 percent in 2003. For two decades, as policymakers kept rates near zero to combat persistent deflation, yields hardly budged. In 2016, they fell below zero, meaning investors were basically paying to hold the bonds. “For many, many years, it was a very difficult market,” the Japan Exchange Group’s Mr. Yamaji said. “Nobody had any interest in trading.” With average daily trading volumes tanking, Japan’s local banks, once the most aggressive traders of government bonds, began to close their trading operations. International groups scaled back as well. Many veterans left high-paying foreign firms like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley. They either “semiretired” or were pushed into less glamorous roles, such as research, at domestic firms, said Yoshiki Kumazawa, a director at Morgan McKinley, a recruitment firm in Tokyo. “We call it ‘juniorization,’” said Mr. Kumazawa, who compared it to shipping a baseball player who once starred for the New York Yankees off to a Japanese team. Mr. Yamaji tried to revive the market throughout the 2010s by introducing new trading methods for the bonds, but the stagnation persisted until 2024. That was when a burst of postpandemic inflation led the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates for the first time in 17 years . This prompted a rise in bond yields. Image Hiromi Yamaji, the chief executive of the group that runs the Tokyo Stock Exchange, remembers when trading Japanese government bonds “was a party.” Credit... Kentaro Takahashi for The New York Times Those yields then spiked higher on Jan. 19, when Ms. Takaichi endorsed a tax-suspension measure estimated to cost more than $30 billion annually. The next day, Japan’s 40-year bond yield broke above 4 percent for the first time since 2007. Some see the surge as an alarming sign that Japan will struggle to finance its debt. Kyle Bass, founder of Hayman Capital Management, a Dallas-based hedge fund, was known in the 2010s for his high-conviction bet that Japanese bond yields would eventually skyrocket as the government’s debt load reached a breaking point, a wager widely dismissed as the ultimate “widow-maker.” He acknowledges that the position did not pay off at the time. Now, with yields rising and Japan’s total debt having risen to a record $8.77 trillion last year, his thesis is becoming harder to dismiss. “The question is: How do they hold it all together?” Mr. Bass said. Borrowing costs are rising in a number of the world’s largest economies. Japan, however, “is about 10 years ahead of everyone in its financial position,” he said. “I’m afraid of the situation they’re in.” For others, the commotion is an opportunity. Average daily trading volumes of J.G.B. futures have surged in recent years, and the number of outstanding positions in the market has reached record highs, according to Mr. Yamaji. Global hedge funds have snapped up top local talent, according to Mr. Kumazawa. Mr. Kubota, the former J.G.B. dealer and well-kn",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT In an opinion heavy on chicken puns, a district court judge ruled on Tuesday that the boneless wings at Buffalo Wild Wings could indeed be called wings. The order, in a lawsuit filed by a Chicago man in 2023, was dripping with skepticism at the claims that the chain was misleading consumers about its boneless wings. Judge John J. Tharp Jr., of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, dismissed the claim by Aimen Halim, saying it “has no meat on its bones.” “Despite his best efforts, Halim did not ‘drum’ up enough factual allegations to state a claim,” Judge Tharp said in his ruling. Buffalo Wild Wings did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for Mr. Halim also did not respond to a request for comment. According to the complaint, Mr. Halim bought boneless wings from Buffalo Wild Wings in Mount Prospect, Ill., in January 2023. Mr. Halim thought he was buying chicken wings that had been deboned, but he soon discovered they were not. Mr. Halim sued Buffalo Wild Wings, saying the chain deceives its customers by labeling its products as “boneless wings,” when the chain instead uses breast meat, which is cheaper. According to the judge’s order, Mr. Halim claimed that had he known the product was not actually deboned chicken wings, he would have paid less or not bought it at all. Buffalo Wild Wings disputed Mr. Halim’s claims, saying that context clues make clear the nuggets cannot be made of wing meat, and that “wing” refers to the style of cooking, not a chicken’s body part. In his order, the judge sided with Buffalo Wild Wings, saying a reasonable consumer would not think that boneless wings were made of wing meat. Judge Tharp noted that cauliflower wings are also sold under the wing section of the restaurant’s menu and as an alternative to traditional wings. “If Halim is right, reasonable consumers should think that cauliflower wings are made (at least in part) from wing meat,” he said. “They don’t, though.” Judge Tharp also said that the menu offered boneless wings at a cheaper price than traditional wings — an indication that the item is not, in fact, deboned. Mr. Halim can amend his claim to try to prove he suffered “economic injury,” but it’s unlikely to be persuasive, Judge Tharp said. He has until March 20 to file an amended complaint. This is not the first time that boneless chicken wings have caused legal action and other drama. The Ohio Supreme Court ruled in July 2024 that a man who ordered boneless wings should have expected the possibility of bones, denying him a jury trial after he suffered serious medical complications from a bone fragment. In 2020, a man in Lincoln, Neb., delivered a passionate plea to his City Council to remove the name boneless wings from menus in the city. And on Reddit, there are hundreds of comments debating the legitimacy of “boneless wings” as a true product, with some carefully explaining how they are different from chicken nuggets. Recipes explaining how to make boneless wings call for a variety of ingredients, but typically begin with a boneless chicken breast.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The U.S. government outlined tens of billions of dollars in planned Japanese investments in the United States as part of a trade agreement struck last year, marking the start of a massive pledge that has faced domestic frictions and financing hurdles. In a statement late Tuesday, the U.S. commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said Japan would provide capital for three projects: a natural gas plant in Ohio, a crude oil export facility along the U.S. Gulf Coast and a synthetic diamond manufacturing site in Georgia. The projects represent a $36 billion commitment and are expected to generate thousands of jobs, Mr. Lutnick said. The energy and manufacturing projects are the first phase of funding under a trade framework agreed in July, under which Tokyo pledged $550 billion in funding to U.S.-based projects. In exchange, the Trump administration agreed to impose a 15 percent blanket tariff on Japanese exports — a reprieve from the more aggressive duties it had threatened. For months, U.S. officials have pressured their Japanese counterparts to move forward with concrete investment plans. For members of the Trump administration, especially Mr. Lutnick, the goal was to maintain momentum after President Trump’s visit to Japan in October. For their part, Japanese officials were eager to show progress before Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s scheduled visit to the United States in March. In an election last week, her party won in a landslide , and Mr. Trump congratulated the prime minister, wishing her success in her “conservative, peace-through-strength agenda.” Around the time of Ms. Takaichi’s visit to the United States, Japanese officials are considering making several additional investment announcements, according to two people familiar with the plans. Japan is aiming to stay out of Mr. Trump’s cross hairs as the country is already feeling the economic ramifications of a prolonged diplomatic dispute with China, Japan’s largest trading partner. Last month, Mr. Trump threatened to raise tariffs on South Korea, saying the country was not moving fast enough to ratify its trade deal with the United States. Japan “understood there needed to be demonstrable progress,” said William Chou, a Japan expert and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a think tank. Without Japan’s investment announcements, “it was uncertain what Trump would have done — whether that was threatening a 25 percent tariff or firing off a few tweets,” Mr. Chou said. “Vibes are good between Trump and Takaichi, so why risk the unknown?” In a post on social media on Tuesday, Mr. Trump hailed the investments. “America is building again,” he wrote, adding that the projects “could not be done without one very special word, tariffs.” During a news conference on Wednesday in Tokyo, Japan’s trade minister, Ryosei Akazawa, said that each project would “promote the economic and national security interests” of both countries. Japanese companies would also benefit by supplying equipment for the projects and their related facilities, he added. Almost all of the spending in the first round of investments is slated for the construction of a natural gas power plant in Portsmouth, Ohio. The $33 billion facility is expected to be the largest natural gas power plant in the world, according to U.S. and Japanese officials. Japanese companies that have expressed interest in supplying the facility include Toshiba, Hitachi, Mitsubishi Electric and SoftBank Group, Mr. Akazawa said. In the months since Mr. Trump’s Tokyo visit, progress on how the $550 billion would be employed had been fitful. Debates have simmered in Japan over how to mobilize such vast sums of capital. Questions have been raised about the plan for the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, a state-owned lender, to serve as the primary financing vehicle for the commitment. Mr. Akazawa, who previously led Japan’s tariff negotiations with the United States, has consistently framed the investments as a “win-win” for both countries. Yet a different sentiment prevails within some business and state-backed finance circles, where the projects are often described as “strategic but less than bankable.” Japan’s investment decisions have also been complicated by an impending Supreme Court decision, expected in the coming months, about whether Mr. Trump exceeded his authority in using a 1970s law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs on dozens of U.S. trade partners. For Japan and many other nations, the threat of tariffs was a key motivator to pledge investments in the United States. That remains true even as officials, including those in Japan, seek to portray the investment decisions as purely strategic, according to David Boling, a principal at the Asia Group, a strategic advisory firm. “Would they be doing this normally? Probably not,” Mr. Boling said. But for Japan, keeping the U.S.-Japanese trade relationship in a good place is clearly the priority, he added. Strategic or not, he said, “there are other more compelling reasons to be doing this.” Hisako Ueno and Tony Romm contributed reporting.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Goldman Sachs is taking another step away from the diversity mandates the Wall Street firm had long championed. Goldman will no longer explicitly consider race, gender and sexual orientation when evaluating a potential board member at the firm, according to two people with knowledge of the bank’s decision who were unable to discuss it publicly because of the confidential nature of the move. The decision is a result of a deal that Goldman struck with the National Legal and Policy Center, a conservative nonprofit group that has been pressuring numerous companies to drop diversity, equity and inclusion mandates, the people said. The group recently announced similar deals with American Express and the equipment manufacturer Deere & Company. As part of its agreement with Goldman, the National Legal and Policy Center, which has a small investment in the bank, withdrew a shareholder proposal demanding that diversity criteria for the board be dropped. The deal was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal. Goldman’s move is part of a broader retreat by corporate America to shun diversity mandates during the Trump administration. The White House claims many of these initiatives amount to discrimination against white workers and job applicants. For years, Goldman’s chief executive, David Solomon, had been a vocal champion of the bank’s commitment to overhauling its traditionally white, male-dominated work force. In March 2019, Mr. Solomon, his top deputy John Waldron and the firm’s chief financial officer at the time, Stephen M. Scherr, declared diversity and inclusion “a top priority.” “When we unite around a common goal, we make progress together,” the men wrote in an email to the staff . They said they would “improve each year” toward goals that included a new recruiting class comprising “50 percent women, 11 percent Black professionals and 14 percent Hispanic/Latino professionals in the Americas, and 9 percent Black professionals in the U.K.” The next year, Mr. Solomon said Goldman would no longer take a company public in the United States or Europe unless it had at least one “diverse” board member. By 2021, a company would need at least two diverse board members in order for Goldman to agree to work on its initial public offering. But since President Trump returned to office, the political and legal winds on diversity have shifted, and Goldman’s commitment to D.E.I. has shifted, too. Last year, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission began questioning the hiring practices at elite law firms, claiming that their efforts to recruit Black and Hispanic lawyers may have potentially discriminated against white candidates. More recently, the agency said it was investigating “systemic allegations of D.E.I.-related intentional race discrimination” against white employees and job applicants at Nike. The sportswear company said it had been complying with the E.E.O.C.’s inquiry. Even before Mr. Trump began his second term, some diversity initiatives were facing legal scrutiny. In late 2024, a federal appeals court said Nasdaq’s rules that set racial and diversity targets for boards that listed on its exchange were invalid. Last February, Goldman said it would drop the policy that required boards of directors of U.S. companies to include women and members of minority groups if the bank was to serve as an underwriter on their initial public offerings. The same month, the firm scrapped the explicit goals it had earlier set for the racial and gender makeup of its recruiting classes. “It doesn’t change our strong belief that successful boards benefit from diverse backgrounds and perspectives,” a Goldman spokeswoman, Jennifer Zuccarelli, said of the recent moves. Goldman’s board is expected to move forward with the change to the diversity criteria for potential board members when it meets this week, the two people with knowledge of the matter said. The meeting will be the board’s first since it convened last week to consider the resignation of Goldman’s general counsel , Kathryn Ruemmler, who said she was stepping down after revelations emerged about her extensive relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. At the bank’s annual shareholder meeting last year, the National Legal and Policy Center’s associate director, Luke Perlot, praised Goldman for having “taken meaningful steps to roll back its D.E.I. programs.” Still, he proposed that the bank eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion goals around compensation for its named executive officers. On that point, the bank’s board recommended against dropping those compensation goals, and fewer than 5 percent of shareholders voted in favor eliminating them.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Revelations about ties to Jeffrey Epstein have toppled leaders of corporate America, Hollywood and academia as the Justice Department has released millions of documents and images from the disgraced financier’s files in recent months. But the Trump administration has steadfastly repelled such fallout, dismissing any associations that top officials had with the sex offender as trivial. The White House’s fortress mentality was mobilized last week after Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, acknowledged that he had traveled to Mr. Epstein’s private island and had another encounter with him years after Mr. Lutnick claimed to have cut ties with him. Such associations have led to the resignations of business leaders, but President Trump’s White House was unfazed. The stark contrast underscores the murky nature of who is deemed to be complicit and who is not when it comes to Mr. Epstein, and the Trump administration’s ability to repel even the most harsh public scrutiny. Despite bipartisan calls for Mr. Lutnick’s resignation, the White House dismissed concerns about his character and credibility. “Secretary Lutnick remains a very important member of President Trump’s team, and the president fully supports the secretary,” Karoline Leavitt, White House press secretary, said last week. Mr. Lutnick’s comments during Senate testimony contradicted his assertion on a podcast last year that he had been so disgusted by Mr. Epstein during a 2005 visit to his townhouse that Mr. Lutnick never set foot in a room with Mr. Epstein again. Mr. Lutnick’s name appeared in more than 250 documents in the Epstein files released by the Justice Department, a review by The New York Times found. He said that he first met Mr. Epstein when they became neighbors in Manhattan in 2005, but that they met only twice more over the next 14 years that he could recall. However, at the Senate hearing Mr. Lutnick confirmed that he and his family traveled to the island in 2012 for a lunch with Mr. Epstein during a vacation aboard his yacht with his wife, children, nannies and another family. The visit took place four years after Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida to soliciting prostitution from a minor as part of a deal with federal prosecutors. Mr. Lutnick is not the only prominent Trump administration official who has appeared in the Epstein documents. The records showed that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, once went hunting for dinosaur fossils with Mr. Epstein. An email in the files showed that Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, invited Mr. Epstein to a 2016 Valentine’s Day party. The Trump administration’s muted response is a striking departure from that of corporate America. Thomas J. Pritzker, a billionaire heir to the Hyatt Hotels fortune , stepped down from his role Monday as executive chairman of the Hyatt Hotels Corporation. Last week, Casey Wasserman, a Los Angeles entertainment executive and chair of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics whose name recently surfaced in the Epstein files, said he had started the process of selling the talent agency he founded more than two decades ago. And last year, Harvard started a new review of ties that its former president Lawrence H. Summers and others at the institution had with Mr. Epstein. After the release of emails between Mr. Summers and Mr. Epstein in November, Mr. Summers said he would step back from public commitments . “Corporate America, they answer to a board,” said Gene Grabowski, a Washington-based crisis communications expert. “Trump doesn’t answer to a board.” Mr. Grabowski added: “The closest thing he has is the voters, and he either doesn’t want to believe the polls or thinks he can reverse them.” A poll conducted last month by The New York Times and Siena University showed that Mr. Trump’s lowest approval rating within the Republican Party came on his handling of the release of files related to Mr. Epstein: Only 53 percent of Republicans approved of his handling of that matter. Mr. Lutnick’s ties to Mr. Epstein pale when compared with those of Mr. Trump, who socialized regularly with Mr. Epstein in the 1990s and 2000s . Using a proprietary search tool, The Times identified more than 5,300 files containing more than 38,000 references to Mr. Trump, his wife, his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, and other related words and phrases in the latest batch of emails, government files, videos and other records released by the Justice Department. Mr. Trump has downplayed his association with Mr. Epstein and accused Democrats of concocting conspiracy theories about their friendship. The president said last summer that he had ended his relationship with the financier because Mr. Epstein had “hired away” spa attendants at Mar-a-Lago. In defending Mr. Lutnick, the White House is again pushing the boundaries of its ability to weather a controversy that might have hobbled other administrations. “This administration has placed all its chips on the idea that the public will eventually tire of controversy, and now they’re betting that even allegations tied to pedophilia fall into that same bucket,” said Alexandra LaManna, who served as a spokeswoman in the Biden administration. “That’s a category of accusation that, historically, has been politically and morally radioactive.” Noting that Mr. Lutnick vacationed on Mr. Epstein’s island, she added: “It’s hard to imagine any president other than Trump trying to shrug that off.” Alan Rappeport is an economic policy reporter for The Times, based in Washington.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT This obituary was originally published on Feb. 17, 2001. It is being republished for a package for Women’s History Month. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Rose Freedman, the last survivor of the Triangle Shirtwaist fire in which 146 of her co-workers perished in 1911, died on Thursday in her apartment in Beverly Hills, Calif., her daughter said. She was 107. Mrs. Freedman, who at the time of the Manhattan fire was two days shy of 18, escaped death in 1911 by following company executives to the roof to be rescued. She became a lifelong crusader for worker safety, telling and retelling the story that the Triangle workers died because the owners were not concerned with their welfare. The disastrous factory fire, in which girls and young women leapt from eighth- and ninth-story windows, their flaming skirts billowing in the wind, horrified the nation and led to some of the first city, state and federal laws dealing with workers’ safety. It gave a powerful impetus to the fledgling labor movement, greatly strengthening the building of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, which two years before the fire had led a three-month strike to focus attention on conditions in workplaces like the Triangle factory. The union’s successor, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, confirmed that Mrs. Freedman, who was Rose Rosenfeld at the time of the fire, was the last survivor to die. The next-to-last, Bessie Cohen, died two years ago. Mrs. Freedman’s life after the fire was colorful and courageous. In World War I, she saved the life of a spy in Austria. After her husband’s death, in 1959, she went back to work to support her three children, two of whom had polio. Lying about her age, she worked at a Manhattan insurance company until she was 79. Mrs. Freedman, who always wore high heels, celebrated her centennial by attending Spanish classes in a Mexican town with cobblestone streets, but refused to abandon her heels for more sensible shoes. “I’d look matronly,” she said. Her involvement in the fire never left her consciousness, and she appeared at labor rallies for the rest of her life. She always expressed rage that the factory doors had been locked, either to keep workers at their machines or to prevent them from stealing scraps of cloth. She always told of how one of the owners tried to bribe her to say the doors were not locked. She refused. The owners were eventually acquitted of manslaughter charges when the jury could not establish whether they had ordered the doors locked or had even known they were. But in 1914, civil suits brought by relatives of 23 victims ended with payments of $75 to each of the families. On the day of the fire, Mrs. Freedman escaped the inferno by stopping to consider what the executives were doing. She somehow thought they would be safer, and went up to the 10th floor, where their offices were, to find out. They were taking the freight elevator to the roof, where firefighters pulled them to the roof of an adjacent building. She did the same. The alternative was jumping. “Girls in shirtwaists, which were aflame, went flying out of the building so that you saw these young women literally ablaze flying out of the windows,” she said in a Public Broadcasting System documentary, “The Living Century,” shown in December and January. As she was taken down the steps of the adjacent building, she stopped on each stoop to sit down and cry. “When I came in the street, here comes my father,” she recalled. “He collapsed. He fainted. And I didn’t go back to work anymore. I went to college.” The anger about what she saw as the owners’ greed persisted. In the documentary, she said: “That’s the whole trouble of this fire. Nobody cares. Nobody. Hundred forty-six people in a half an hour. I have always tears in my eyes when I think. It should never have happened. The executives with a couple of steps could have opened the door. But they thought they were better than the working people. It’s not fair because material, money, is more important here than everything. “That’s the biggest mistake — that a person doesn’t count much when he hasn’t got money. What good is a rich man and he hasn’t got a heart? I don’t pretend. I feel it. Still.” Rose Rosenfeld was born on March 27, 1893, in a small town north of Vienna. Her family ran a profitable business importing and exporting dried foods. After her father visited New York and fell in love with it, the family began spending more and more time in the United States, finally emigrating in 1909. They sailed on the Mauretania. With Mrs. Freedman’s father devoting most of his time to Jewish studies, the business was run by her mother. An aunt who lived with the family once sharply criticized the young woman’s housecleaning abilities. “You call this work?” she demanded. Mrs. Freedman’s response was to go out the next day and take a job at the Triangle factory. Since her language skills were good — she eventually spoke seven languages — she was given the prestigious job of operating a large machine to attach buttons to the blouses. Her only close friend at the factory, a forewoman, died in the fire. She attended college in New York, although family members are not sure where. When she and her mother took a trip to their Austrian hometown to show Mrs. Freedman’s grandparents that she was really alive, World War I had broken out, and the Russians had invaded Austria. Her grandfather had befriended a man who turned out to be a Russian spying against his own country for Austria. She told of hiding him by burying him in coal in the basement, then talking the pursuing Cossacks into leaving without a search. After returning to New York, she got a job with Cunard, the steamship line. In 1927, she married Harry Freedman, an American she had first met at the American Club in Vienna. He owned a typewriter store in New York. They had three children. When the two youngest were stricken with polio, Mrs. Freedman asked when they would be able to walk. The doctor said, “Five years.” She replied, “I have time.” Mr. Freedman died at 59, leaving Mrs. Freedman no money or source of income. She got an accounting job at the Manhattan Life Insurance Company. Her youthful appearance enabled her to say she was 50, when she was actually 64. “Of course it was a lie, but they didn’t know it was a lie,” she said. She worked until she was 79. In 1995, she moved to Los Angeles, where her son Robert and her daughter, Arlene March, live. There, she became such an avid fan of the Lakers that she became livid if someone phoned while a game was being shown on television. On her 100th birthday she was presented with a team jersey bearing the number 100. She exhibited paintings at the Beverly Hills Art Fair, and continued to paint almost until her death. She had her hair and nails done weekly, and shopped and cooked for herself. Mrs. Freedman was still attending Spanish language classes at 107. “To me, 106 is a number,” she said in the documentary. “I lived that long, not only on account of my genes, but on account of my attitude. You’ve got to stand up for yourself. Am I right?” Other survivors are another son, Herbert, of Rye Brook, N.Y., eight grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. She was overjoyed at the great-granddaughter’s birth, and always advised the child’s mother, her granddaughter, Dana Walden, who is president of 20th Century Fox Television, not to get caught in grief when loved ones died. “Sadness takes years from you,” she said. Her own passing ends a chapter of history. Steven Latham, director of the documentary, suggested it was something like the last Holocaust survivor dying. “This is the last voice of an event,” he said. “This woman actually smelled the smoke.” Share full article Related Content Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Bayer, the German pharmaceutical and biotech giant, said Tuesday that it had reached an agreement that would pay plaintiffs $7.25 billion to settle tens of thousands of lawsuits that claimed the weedkiller Roundup caused non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The agreement was submitted to a Missouri circuit court judge in St. Louis, and approval is not guaranteed. A $10 billion settlement unraveled in 2020 after a judge objected to how future claims would be handled. The latest deal would cover both current and future claims, and create a fund that Bayer would pay into over the next 17 to 21 years, according to a company statement. Bayer executives hailed the agreement as a significant step in the company’s efforts to control costs from litigation against Roundup, which Monsanto developed in the 1970s. Bayer acquired Monsanto in 2016. Since then, the company has set aside $10 billion to settle lawsuits over the herbicide. With this settlement, Bayer’s legal costs would approach $14 billion in total, according to Bayer’s statement. Bill Anderson, Bayer’s chief executive, previously said the company would stop manufacturing Roundup, which farmers around the world use to kill weeds and increase crop yields, if it couldn’t find a way to end the lawsuits. “Today marks an important milestone for the company,” Mr. Anderson said on a call announcing the settlement. Shares of Bayer rose more than 7 percent after the announcement. A major factor in driving the settlement is an upcoming Supreme Court case that will decide whether federal law shields Bayer from many Roundup-related lawsuits. Most of the lawsuits against Bayer have been filed in state courts, arguing that the company violated state labeling laws because it did not warn users that Roundup could cause cancer. Bayer argues that the Environmental Protection Agency has found Roundup to be safe and that, according to federal labeling standards, it should be protected from the more than 40,000 active lawsuits, of 170,000 total, that have been filed against the company. Ensuring that those suing received some compensation before the Supreme Court ruling was paramount. “If Monsanto prevails, many claims nationwide would be dismissed or curtailed,” said Christopher Seeger, one of the plaintiffs’ lawyers. If the settlement is approved, it will not be affected by the outcome of the Supreme Court case. Mr. Anderson, the Bayer chief executive, said the settlement “complements” the Supreme Court case, even though many of the cases that Bayer is settling could be invalidated if the justices rule in its favor. He said this agreement and a Supreme Court win would provide “the tightest possible form of containment” of litigation, by settling existing cases and making future cases easier to win. Bayer has played legal Whac-a-Mole since it acquired Monsanto, settling tens of thousands of suits against Roundup before reaching a trial. But a number have gone to trial and resulted in verdicts of hundreds of millions of dollars for a single case. Many of those awards have been reduced on appeal.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Stephen Colbert said on his late-night show on Monday that his network, CBS, barred him from airing an interview with a Democratic candidate for a U.S. Senate race because of new guidance from the Trump administration about equal airtime for political candidates. It’s the first time that a late-night talk show has changed its programming to meet the demands of that update from the Federal Communications Commission, which has over the last year ramped up its efforts to crack down on the major media companies for perceived bias. Mr. Colbert, a frequent critic of President Trump, made it clear he did not make the change willingly. Over six minutes on Monday’s edition of “The Late Show,” Mr. Colbert blasted Brendan Carr, the chairman of the F.C.C. And, in a rebuke of CBS, Mr. Colbert said that “because my network clearly doesn’t want us to talk about this, let’s talk about this.” Mr. Colbert said that CBS lawyers had told him “in no uncertain terms” that an interview he had planned for Monday’s show with State Representative James Talarico of Texas would not air on the show, even though the lawmaker was already in Mr. Colbert’s studio. Early voting began on Tuesday in the Texas primary election, where Mr. Talarico is competing against Jasmine Crockett to be the state’s Democratic nominee to run against Senator John Cornyn, a Republican. Mr. Colbert pointed to new guidance from the F.C.C. from January, warning media companies that talk shows carried on local broadcast networks were required to offer equal airtime to candidates competing for the same office. CBS pushed back on Mr. Colbert’s version of events on Tuesday, saying the network had “not prohibited” the interview from airing but that it instead “provided legal guidance” that broadcasting the interview could trigger the F.C.C. equal-time rule. CBS said it then presented the show “options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled.” There has long been an exemption to the F.C.C.’s equal-time rule for “bona fide news” programming, such as evening news programs. Media companies have long taken it as a given that late-night shows qualified for the same exemption, particularly after the F.C.C. ruled in 2006 that interviews on “The Tonight Show With Jay Leno” were considered bona fide news. After the F.C.C. issued its new guidance, Mr. Carr underscored that was no longer the case. “For years, legacy TV networks assumed that their late-night & daytime talk shows qualify as ‘bona fide news’ programs — even when motivated by purely partisan political purposes,” he said on X last month. “Today, the F.C.C. reminded them of their obligation to provide all candidates with equal opportunities.” Representatives for the F.C.C. and Mr. Colbert declined to comment. Mr. Trump has repeatedly lashed out against many late-night hosts since he returned to the White House last year — just this weekend, he insulted Bill Maher, the HBO talk show host, in a post on Truth Social. Mr. Carr has taken particular aim at late night and daytime television shows that he believes are biased. Last year, ABC removed “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” from its airwaves for almost a week after Mr. Carr suggested that the administration could punish the network because of remarks the late-night host had made in a monologue. Earlier this month, the F.C.C. started a probe into ABC’s “The View” because of an interview with Mr. Talarico, Fox News reported . On Monday’s show, Mr. Colbert repeatedly criticized Mr. Carr, at one point saying that he looked like a “smug bowling pin,” and saying that he believed Mr. Carr was “motivated by partisan purposes.” “Let’s just call this what it is,” Mr. Colbert said. “Donald Trump’s administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV because all Trump does is watch TV.” Mr. Colbert went on to say that he and Mr. Kimmel were “two of the people most affected by this threat” because they had promptly criticized the new guidance when it was announced last month. Because the equal-time provisions apply only to broadcast airwaves, Mr. Colbert announced his interview with Mr. Talarico would be posted to his show’s YouTube page, though he said that network lawyers told him not to give out a URL or a QR code to the link. That interview had more than 1.7 million views on YouTube early Tuesday afternoon, significantly more than the 93,000 views of a video of Mr. Colbert interviewing Jennifer Garner, who was also a guest on Monday’s episode. The F.C.C.’s lone Democratic commissioner, Anna Gomez, said on Tuesday that CBS’s refusal to air the interview was “another troubling example of corporate capitulation in the face of this administration’s broader campaign to censor and control speech.” Mr. Colbert is in his final months hosting “The Late Show,” which will go off the air in May. CBS has said that the show’s cancellation was “purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night,” but many have continued to speculate that the network removed the show for political reasons. CBS’s parent company, Paramount, is also competing with Netflix to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery. Any deal would require the blessing of the federal government.

Billy Barraclough for The New York Times Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 3:36 min Learn more Share full article 6 By Katie Robertson Feb. 17, 2026 Adam Baidawi recalls being enthralled by GQ magazine the first time he pored through an issue as a teenager in suburban Melbourne, Australia. Some two decades later — and on the other side of the world — Mr. Baidawi will now take the helm of the men’s magazine as its next global editorial director. Condé Nast, the publisher of GQ and other brands like Vogue and The New Yorker, on Tuesday announced Mr. Baidawi’s promotion to the top job, effective immediately. Mr. Baidawi, 35, who led British GQ and was the deputy global editorial director, will now oversee all of GQ, including its U.S. publication and its global editions, as well as the music publication Pitchfork , which was folded into GQ in 2024. He replaces the longtime GQ editor Will Welch , who announced in January after a run atop the masthead that he was leaving to move to Paris to work with Pharrell Williams, the musician and men’s creative director for Louis Vuitton. Mr. Baidawi’s appointment is the latest shake-up of the top editorial ranks at Condé Nast, which in recent months has promoted a new generation of internal talent. In June, Mark Guiducci , the 37-year-old creative director of Vogue, became the top editor of Vanity Fair. And last fall, Chloe Malle , 40, the editor of Vogue’s website, succeeded Anna Wintour as American Vogue’s top editor. (Ms. Wintour, 76, remains Vogue’s global editorial director as well as the chief content officer for Condé Nast.) Mr. Baidawi, who is Iraqi Australian, started his career as a music writer and wrote freelance articles for the Australian edition of GQ. He spent a year as an Australia correspondent for The New York Times before spotting a job advertisement looking for someone to launch GQ Middle East. He was named the editor in chief of GQ Middle East in 2018 at age 28, making him the youngest-ever editor in chief of a GQ edition.

Billy Barraclough for The New York Times In 2021, Mr. Baidawi became the deputy global editorial director of GQ and the head of editorial content of British GQ. In an interview from London, Mr. Baidawi said he wanted to restore GQ “to its rightful place as the North Star of masculinity” and to have the magazine be “more participatory in the cultural and political debates of our time.” Mr. Baidawi added that while there was a lot of hand wringing currently about the online “manosphere” and toxic masculinity, the current counterprogramming amounted to lectures and earnestness. “I’m curious to propose a version of masculinity that is yes, progressive, yes, modern, but is also sexier and cooler and more aspirational and more desirable than some of the nihilism or cruelty or vanity that we see out there,” he said. Mr. Baidawi also said he planned to incorporate more long-form video and long-form audio into the GQ brand. In a statement, Ms. Wintour described Mr. Baidawi as “a cultural thinker at a time when the culture needs to be thought through, and even interrogated a little.” “This is someone GQ’s readers can expect to challenge received wisdom — about modern masculinity and the worlds of celebrity, sport and fashion — and have a lot of fun doing so,” she said. Mr. Baidawi will relocate to New York, and his first print issue of GQ will publish in September. Katie Robertson covers the media industry for The Times.

Ricardo Nagaoka for The New York Times In today's newsletter: Paramount notches a win More Epstein files fallout Anthropic’s latest fight with Washington Goldman’s latest retreat on diversity Andrew here. Hope you enjoyed the long weekend. Today, Lauren Hirsch dives into Warner Bros. Discovery restarting merger talks with Paramount and explains what would make it walk away from a deal with Netflix. We also examine Goldman Sachs’s reported decision to drop a diversity requirement for its board. And we look at more fallout from the Epstein files. Paramount notches a win Paramount has sought for weeks to force Warner Bros. Discovery back to the M.&A. negotiating table. On Tuesday, it has finally received a chance to win the battle over the movie and television studio. Warner Bros. Discovery just said that it would restart merger talks with Paramount , giving its suitor roughly a week to make its case to abandon its deal with Netflix. Warner Bros. Discovery isn’t definitely switching sides. Its deal agreement with Netflix gives it the right to talk with a rival bidder if that is likely to lead to a “reasonably superior offer.” Warner Bros. Discovery doesn’t think that’s the case here — but Netflix has given it until Feb. 23 to talk with Paramount to clarify several questions about that company’s competing offer. For now, Warner Bros. Discovery’s board is still recommending that shareholders vote in favor of the Netflix offer. Netflix added in a separate statement: “This does not change the fact that we have the only signed, board-recommended agreement with W.B.D., and ours is the only certain path to delivering value to W.B.D.’s stockholders.” But Paramount has made headway in casting doubt on that. The rival studio has argued that its bid — a deal for all of Warner Bros. Discovery, instead of the more complicated structure of the Netflix transaction, which involves spinning out the Warner cable networks — offers more certainty for shareholders. It doesn’t hurt that a Paramount representative has said the company would raise its takeover price to $31 a share if the Warner Bros. Discovery board authorized talks, and suggested that the company could pay even more. (Paramount has already tossed in sweeteners such as offering to cover the Netflix deal’s $2.8 billion breakup fee and to pay Warner Bros. Discovery a quarterly “ticking fee” if its deal closes behind schedule.) And several Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders, including the hedge funds Ancora and Pentwater Capital Management , have pushed the studio operator to reopen talks with Paramount. (Warner Bros. Discovery has now set March 20 as the date for an investor vote on the Netflix offer.) Big questions remain: How much higher would Netflix be willing to raise its offer for any counterbid? Worth noting: Shares in the streaming giant rose this morning, after having fallen since clinching a deal for Warner Bros. Discovery. How would Paramount finance a higher takeover bid, given that Warner Bros. Discovery has expressed concern about how much debt it already plans to use ? HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING The Fed weighs moves to bolster bank lending. The central bank is preparing to ease capital requirements for U.S. banks , a vice chair, Michelle Bowman, announced on Monday. Banks have seen their share of mortgage originations in the U.S. fall to 35 percent in 2023 from 60 percent in 2008, Bowman said. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has blamed capital regulations for driving lending to nonbank financial services companies. California and Britain strike a clean energy deal. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an agreement on Monday that calls for the two sides to bolster efforts to collaborate on green tech and invest in clean energy. It comes as the Trump administration has dismantled some legal protections for climate and Biden administration initiatives to advance a low-carbon transition. President Trump called the deal “ inappropriate .” The Fed, earnings and inflation data top investors’ agenda this week. Minutes from the central bank’s January meeting are set for release on Wednesday, offering clues about policymakers’ thinking on interest rates. Walmart, Wayfair and Klarna report quarterly results on Thursday, providing more insight on the state of the consumer. The Personal Consumption Expenditures report, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, is scheduled for publication on Friday. Image More Epstein files fallout The Jeffrey Epstein files continue to jolt corporate America , including Hollywood. The heat is also growing in Washington and academia . The latest: Thomas Pritzker, a scion of the Hyatt Hotels empire, stepped down on Monday as executive chairman of the hotels giant, after the files revealed that he was in regular contact with the convicted sex offender in the years after Epstein’s 2008 plea deal on sex crimes charges. Pritzker and Epstein corresponded frequently as they arranged appointments, including visits to Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse. In a 2018 email exchange, Pritzker agreed to help Karyna Shuliak, Epstein’s girlfriend, arrange a trip to Southeast Asia. After Shuliak told Pritzker she was going there “to try to find a new girlfriend for Jeffrey,” Pritzker responded with a smiley-face emoticon and wrote, “May the Force be with you.” Pritzker said in a statement released on Monday that he had “exercised terrible judgment in maintaining contact with” Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s longtime companion. “There is no excuse for failing to distance myself sooner,” he added. Pritzker, a cousin of JB Pritzker, a Democrat and the governor of Illinois, also said he would not seek re-election to Hyatt’s board in May. And then there’s Casey Wasserman. The sports and entertainment mogul, whose decades-old flirtatious messages with Maxwell appeared in the files, is facing increased pressure to step down as chairman of LA28 , the organizing committee for the Olympics in Los Angeles. Karen Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles, on Monday became the highest-ranking elected official to call on Wasserman to resign from LA28. “I do think that we need to look at the leadership,” she said after criticizing the Olympic organizers’ decision last week to back Wasserman. Wasserman announced on Friday that he had begun the process of selling the Wasserman Group , his powerhouse talent agency that has experienced some high-profile defections since the latest Epstein revelations. “I’m deeply sorry that my past personal mistakes have caused you so much discomfort,” he wrote to employees. In related news, some politicians in Ohio have begun distancing themselves from Les Wexner . Wexner, the billionaire founder of L Brands and an early patron of Epstein, had been a major donor to several local races there. Attorney General Pam Bondi’s combative congressional testimony last week over the Epstein investigation continued to draw anger from the right. Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, said he had lost confidence in Bondi days after some right-wing political commentators called for her resignation . Anthropic’s latest fight with Washington Anthropic’s stated focus on safety has set it apart in the artificial intelligence race — and drawn the ire of some White House officials. A new report suggests that the Trump administration is weighing a move that could deal the A.I. start-up a big blow, underscoring a major disagreement between the two sides on how to deploy the technology. The Pentagon is threatening to cut ties with Anthropic, and more, Axios reports . More specifically, the Defense Department is considering designating Anthropic a “supply chain risk,” meaning that other military contractors would have to stop working with the company, too. It’s a designation typically reserved for overseas adversaries, Axios adds. The threat aris",

Paramount will have until Feb. 23 to negotiate its best and final offer. Warner Bros. Discovery last year rejected Paramount’s offer to buy the entire company for $108 billion in favor of a deal to sell only its streaming and studios business to Netflix for $83 billion. Warner Bros. Discovery said at the time that Netflix offered the better deal for shareholders. Paramount disagreed and quickly made its case to shareholders through a hostile bid . In the roughly two months since then, Paramount has amended its offer twice , each time addressing some of the concerns that Warner Bros. Discovery’s board had raised. Paramount’s chief executive, David Ellison, has also raised questions about the Netflix bid, including whether its deal can pass regulatory scrutiny. Some Warner Bros. Discovery investors, including Pentwater Capital Management, have also raised concerns, encouraging the company to restart talks with Paramount. Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Skydance were both up about 3 percent in premarket trading. To date, Paramount has not publicly raised its offer from $30 a share. But last week, Warner Bros. Discovery said that a senior representative for Paramount had verbally informed a company board member that, if the board authorized talks with Paramount, it would agree to pay $31 a share. In that conversation, the Paramount representative added that it would be willing to further improve its offer. “It’s about time the actual headline price bidding heated up in what has to be one of the most inactive corporate bidding wars in history,” Eric Talley, a business professor at Columbia Law School, said. In a letter to the Paramount board on Tuesday, David Zaslav, the chief executive of Warner Bros. Discovery, and Samuel A. DiPiazza Jr., chairman of the company, said: “We welcome the opportunity to engage with you and expeditiously determine whether PSKY can deliver an actionable, binding proposal that provides superior value.” In Paramount’s latest offer, it agreed to pay the $2.8 billion fee Warner Bros. Discovery would owe to Netflix if their agreement were terminated, as well as agreeing to back Warner Bros. Discovery’s debt costs. Paramount also said it would pay Warner Bros. Discovery’s shareholders around $650 million in cash, starting in 2027, for each quarter that the deal did not close. Warner Bros. Discovery said Tuesday that it had requested a number of clarifications about Paramount’s latest proposal. Among them were concerns about the extent of Paramount’s support for Warner Bros. Discovery’s debt costs and the conditions under which Paramount could legally walk away from a deal. It also wanted assurances that Paramount would be willing to contribute more equity if its debt financing fell apart. According to the terms of Warner Bros. Discovery’s contract with Netflix, it can engage in talks with a rival bidder if it thinks it can lead to a “reasonably superior offer.” Warner Bros. Discovery said in its letter on Tuesday that it did not yet think that Paramount’s offer met that bar — but that Netflix had given Warner Bros. Discovery a seven-day waiver to see if it could clarify its concerns. “Throughout the robust and highly competitive strategic review process, Netflix has consistently taken a constructive, responsive approach with WBD, in stark contrast to Paramount Skydance,” Netflix said in a statement released on Tuesday. “While we are confident that our transaction provides superior value and certainty, we recognize the ongoing distraction for WBD stockholders and the broader entertainment industry caused by PSKY’s antics.” On Tuesday, Paramount acknowledged Warner Bros. Discovery’s decision, saying in a statement that it had opted to secure a waiver rather than deeming Paramount’s bid as one that could be reasonably expected to be superior. In doing so, Paramount said, Warner Bros. Discovery did not allow itself “an unfettered right to negotiate without a time deadline.” “Although the board’s actions are unusual,” the statement said, “Paramount is nonetheless prepared to engage in good faith and constructive discussions.” If Paramount makes a superior offer, Netflix has the right to improve its own bid. Shares of Netflix have been under pressure since it announced the deal in December, falling about 15 percent this year. Its stock rose 1.5 percent in premarket trading. Discovery said on Tuesday that it had scheduled a shareholder vote on Netflix’s offer for March 20. Lauren Hirsch is a Times reporter who covers deals and dealmakers in Wall Street and Washington.

Eric Lee for The New York Times Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 11:29 min Learn more Share full article 485 By Tony Romm Reporting from Washington Feb. 17, 2026 Shortly after returning to office, President Trump embarked on an aggressive campaign to pare back the core functions of the federal government, unveiling a budget that proposed some of the steepest spending reductions in U.S. history. Nearly one year later, Congress has rejected much of that vision. In a little-noticed development, lawmakers have systematically brushed off many of Mr. Trump’s most severe cuts for this fiscal year, leaving intact a vast set of federal education, health, housing and research programs that the White House had tried to slash or eliminate. For Mr. Trump, the result is a set of annual government expenses that do not appear radically different on paper compared with what he inherited in January 2025. Overall, Congress is on track to approve more than $1.6 trillion in discretionary spending for 2026, amounting to little change from the previous fiscal year, according to a preliminary analysis of federal budget records by the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan research organization.

Targeting primarily domestic programs, Mr. Trump had originally recommended about $163 billion in deep spending cuts . But lawmakers often did not abide, and in the end, some of the funding that the president had tried to erase — including for medical research, college aid and benefits for poor people — instead changed only slightly, the data show. Mr. Trump still prevailed in other ways, most notably in his efforts to scale back the size and reach of government by ousting thousands of federal workers. Still, the outcome on Capitol Hill underscores the complex and fraught politics of austerity: Where the president sees evidence of spending that is woke, weaponized or wasteful , his critics in both parties see money that is essential to their communities and the broader economy. At times, the difficult dynamic has put the White House at odds with some congressional Republicans, many of whom are up for re-election this November. That has only reinforced Mr. Trump’s desire to circumvent lawmakers altogether, using a series of contested and potentially illegal maneuvers to revoke billions in congressionally approved spending that the president disfavors. Kent Smetters, the faculty director for the Penn Wharton Budget Model, said that, for now, Congress had “basically rejected” everything that Mr. Trump had sought. By law, the White House must send Congress a budget by the first Monday in February — a deadline that presidents from both parties have regularly missed without consequence. The administration is expected to release its latest blueprint for the 2027 fiscal year as soon as next month. Still, Mr. Smetters added that the result this year illustrated a well-worn truth that presidential budgets are “aspirational in nature,” and that in the fight to trim spending, there are always “strong vested interests” for keeping federal funds intact. To come to the preliminary budget estimates, The New York Times analyzed spending across the 11 appropriations bills adopted by Congress, primarily using early data furnished by Democrats on the Senate Appropriations Committee and a set of outside groups, including Penn Wharton. A final, 12th bill, covering homeland security, has not yet passed. Top Republican appropriators did not respond to requests for comment. The analysis focused primarily on domestic spending, not defense, which Mr. Trump has increased considerably in his first year back in office. He secured some of that military funding as part of his sprawling tax legislation, which was paid for in part by cutting back benefits in programs like Medicaid and food stamps. In effect, the changes broke with a long-running tradition in Washington to treat defense and domestic spending with parity, a development that the administration sees as one of its signature victories. The White House nonetheless maintains that it has meaningfully changed the nation’s fiscal trajectory during Mr. Trump’s second term. The administration has already moved to shutter entire agencies and revoke billions in spending previously authorized by Congress. That includes rescinding about $14 billion that lawmakers adopted for foreign aid and public broadcasting last year. Some of the cuts, including federal support for the organization that funds NPR, were sustained by Congress in recent months, which helped to lower the overall amount spent by the government in 2026, according to officials at the White House budget office, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe their thinking. “The appropriations bills, reconciliation, rescissions, all the different tools we are using — it’s the end of futility,” Russell T. Vought, the director of the budget office, said in a statement, referring to the legislative processes that allowed Mr. Trump to enact his tax legislation and repeal past spending. Image President Trump’s budget proposed some of the steepest spending cuts in U.S. history. Credit... Kenny Holston/The New York Times Marc Goldwein, the senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said that the president’s actions in his first year in office carried mixed budgetary implications. On one hand, he said the Trump administration did not “get a big nominal cut in spending” in Congress for the 2026 fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30. But Mr. Goldwein, whose group supports deficit reduction, said the White House did manage to ward off perennial spending increases for domestic programs, which still amounted to a “big victory.” Last spring, for example, Mr. Trump took his first steps to try to dismantle the Education Department, where he and his aides froze funds and either fired or reassigned staff members without congressional approval. Yet Democrats and Republicans adopted a funding deal in late January that provisioned $79 billion for the agency, a slight increase from 2025, the data show. They also rejected some of the president’s ideas, including his attempt to sharply reduce funding for Pell grants, which aid low-income college students. At the White House, officials said they still believe that they can proceed with their attempts to dissolve the department and relocate its staff this year, arguing that the new funding legislation did not explicitly prevent them from doing so. Lawmakers similarly rejected steep cuts proposed by Mr. Trump for agencies including the Departments of Commerce, Labor and Health and Human Services, which saw only slight changes to their overall, annual budgets, the records show. And they jettisoned some of Mr. Trump’s most significant attempts to whittle down antipoverty programs, particularly federal housing assistance. The president initially proposed overhauling — and halving — the funding for a stable of benefits that includes housing vouchers, which serve about 2.4 million low-income households . But Congress did not weigh his proposed restructuring. Instead",

      "content": "The vague messages of San Francisco’s billboards have become a fixture of the A.I. boom as more start-ups raise funds and demand attention. Credit... Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 4:13 min Learn more Share full article 2 By Natallie Rocha Visuals by Minh Connors Reporting from San Francisco Feb. 17, 2026 If you had to ask whose forehead was plastered on a billboard along San Francisco’s Route 101 last month, you were clearly not in the start-up world. The large ad, declaring “Target Marc on TV,” was among a smattering of head-scratching billboards by Vibe, a New York-based advertising technology start-up, that put the insider culture of tech on full display. The forehead alluded to one of the tech industry’s most well-known investors, Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Another nearby wallscape showed just a leather-clad shoulder, a nod to Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chip maker Nvidia, who is known for his fondness for black motorcycle jackets . A billboard for Elon Musk, the Tesla mogul who also owns the social media network X, pictured a kitchen sink — a nod to a viral video of Mr. Musk carrying a sink into Twitter’s office in 2022 with the caption “let that sink in.” Image The forehead of the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen can be quickly spotted by a subset of tech industry insiders. Vibe’s campaign, which ran through January, was playing a tech industry insider game: targeting a tiny audience of tech investors and influencers who would get the joke and — just maybe — try to find who was behind those billboards. And while other ad campaigns have forced Bay Area residents to decode tech lingo, Vibe’s billboards took obscurity to a new level of microtargeting. “These are people that everyone in the Valley wants to talk to,” said Arthur Querou, chief executive of Vibe, which creates targeting and analytics software for companies to run advertisements on streaming services. Mr. Querou said one of Vibe’s products offered an advertising algorithm to place streaming ads in front of specific people, like executives in a particular region. That’s why, he said, the recent billboards nod to Silicon Valley celebrities who clients may want to “target” on TV. “It’s very recognizable,” Mr. Querou said of the ad campaign. “Of course, a lot of people in S.F. will not understand the joke, but the people we want to talk to do get the joke.” Image The “Jensen” in question is Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia who often wears black leather jackets. There are billions being invested in San Francisco’s start-up scene right now, and a lot of that money will go toward marketing. Mr. Querou hopes his analog ads will lead start-ups to put some of that cash toward streaming ads with his firm. Advertising on a San Francisco billboard or wallscape can cost anywhere from $15,000 for a downtown ad to the low six figures for prime signage along Route 101 for about six weeks, said Christopher Tavlarides, president of Capitol Outdoor, which owns about 30 billboards across the Bay Area. Mr. Tavlarides said the demand for ad space had increased over the past year, especially for billboards near certain tech offices or venture capital firms. But for those who aren’t in on the joke, the deluge of tech ads have become white noise. “To be honest, it’s too vague for me, and I feel that’s the point,” said James Markert, looking up at a brick wall that said “Target Tim on TV” next to a bitten red apple. The “Tim” in question was Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple. Image Another billboard refers to Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple. Mr. Markert, a bartender in the city’s Jackson Square neighborhood, said he had no idea what “Tim” this ad was targeting. While Vibe’s billboards have gone viral online, Mr. Querou said he was “a bit sad” to not have heard from the tech executives they called out yet. Representatives for Apple, Nvidia and SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment. Image One of Vibe’s billboards was inspired by a 2022 video of Elon Musk carrying a sink during his takeover of Twitter. Still, Mr. Querou received plenty of texts from friends he went to college with at the University of California, Berkeley. Some of them now work in San Francisco as engineers at big tech companies, not start-ups, and sent him pictures of the billboards. But they still didn’t know whom the “Marc” ads were targeting, he said. Danielle Jing, who works at a start-up down the block from the Jackson Square Apple ad, didn’t get the joke. She squinted up at the wallscape on her walk back to the office on a recent evening and said it must just be for “online tech people.” But the forehead billboard along Route 101? She said she immediately knew that reference because she used to work in venture capital. Mr. Andreessen, the owner of that viral forehead, did not respond to a request for comment.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT For nearly 20 years, Anderson Cooper has had a rare double billing in the TV industry: anchor on CNN and correspondent for “60 Minutes,” the celebrated newsmagazine on CBS. Now, he’s back to being a solo act. On Monday evening, Mr. Cooper said he was leaving “60 Minutes” to spend more time with his two young sons “while they still want to spend time with me.” “Being a correspondent at ‘60 Minutes’ has been one of the great honors of my career,” Mr. Cooper said. “I got to tell amazing stories, and work with some of the best producers, editors and camera crews in the business.” After juggling his jobs at CNN and CBS with the demands of raising two boys, Mr. Cooper said, he wants “to spend as much time with them as possible.” Mr. Cooper’s departure will be a blow for “60 Minutes,” where he has been a contributor since 2006. Over the years, Mr. Cooper, 58, has become one of the program’s most recognizable journalists, winning Emmy Awards for his coverage of sexual assault in the Democratic Republic of Congo and for a story about an unlikely group of Grammy-nominated musicians in Malawi’s Zomba Prison. In a statement, CBS News said it was thankful that Mr. Cooper had “taken ‘60 Minutes’ viewers on journeys to faraway places, told us unforgettable stories, reported consequential investigations and interviewed many prominent figures.” “We’re grateful to him for dedicating so much of his life to this broadcast, and understand the importance of spending more time with family,” the statement said. “‘60 Minutes’ will be here if he ever wants to return.” “60 Minutes” has come under scrutiny recently because of tensions between its on-air correspondents and Bari Weiss, the recently appointed editor in chief of CBS News. The program itself became a story late last year after Ms. Weiss made a last-minute decision to hold a segment about a prison in El Salvador over the objections of Sharyn Alfonsi, the veteran “60 Minutes” correspondent who covered the story. Ms. Weiss said the piece needed more reporting; Ms. Alfonsi said the decision was motivated by politics. The story eventually ran with minimal changes. Ms. Weiss later said in a town-hall meeting with employees in January that she had no desire to repeat “that specific logistical nightmare,” of pulling a story so close to broadcast, ever again. In recent years, Mr. Cooper’s career has encompassed much more than TV news. He has written several books, most recently a historical biography chronicling the wealthy Astor family. (Mr. Cooper is a scion of another Gilded Age dynasty, the Vanderbilts.) He also hosts a podcast about grief and bereavement, “All There Is,” which explores loss with in-depth interviews. Mr. Cooper’s departure was earlier reported by Breaker, an email newsletter. Benjamin Mullin reports for The Times on the major companies behind news and entertainment.

Haiyun Jiang/The New York Times Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 15:18 min Learn more Share full article By Ana Swanson Ana Swanson has written about international trade for over a decade. She reported from Washington. Feb. 16, 2026 On Jan. 26, 2025, Jamieson Greer was teaching Sunday school to a group of 9-year-olds when one of his phones started blowing up with calls from the White House. Six days into the new administration, President Trump was already deploying his favorite weapon: the threat of crippling tariffs to bend countries to his will. This time, the president was threatening Colombia, after it refused to accept U.S. military planes of deported immigrants. Mr. Greer would not join the Trump administration for some time yet, but he was already a key adviser on trade, flying to Mar-a-Lago in the weeks before to help plan Mr. Trump’s agenda. “Why do you have two phones?” a student asked him. “I have a kind of crazy job,” Mr. Greer replied. As the United States trade representative, Mr. Greer, 45, has been a powerful but behind-the-scenes force in transforming the global economy. His calm demeanor is often overshadowed in a cabinet filled with outspoken, brash billionaires. Yet few have done more in Mr. Trump’s second term to put into practice the president’s vision of altering the system governing how trillions of dollars of goods move around the world. Mr. Greer has provided the legal and policy framework to overhaul a global system Mr. Trump slams as unfair. He has helped the president raise tariffs to their highest levels in nearly a century while simultaneously leading negotiations with all of America’s biggest trading partners. So far, he has helped Mr. Trump reach initial trade arrangements with dozens of countries. Interviews with Mr. Greer make clear that he is a true believer in Mr. Trump’s plan to use tariffs to revitalize the United States manufacturing sector. He and other advisers have ushered in steep import taxes to try to protect manufacturers from foreign competition, coax more factories into the United States and create more good-paying factory jobs. “What the president has done is amazing,” Mr. Greer said in an interview in January. “He has restructured global trade.” It’s not yet clear those initiatives will work. Manufacturing employs less than 10 percent of Americans, and the number of factory workers has been dwindling. While some manufacturers support protectionism, others say it raises their costs and makes U.S. industry less competitive. Consumers are also concerned about tariffs increasing prices , and polls show Mr. Trump losing support for his handling of the economy. Though Mr. Greer credits the president’s tariff threats with giving him leverage in negotiations, Mr. Trump’s penchant for brinkmanship has clearly added uncertainty and complications to how countries deal with the United States. Mr. Trump has continued to threaten countries with tariffs, even if they have already agreed to trade deals, leaving companies unsure how permanent his policies are. This year seems likely to bring more tumult, as the Supreme Court reviews whether to overturn many of these tariffs. The administration is also preparing for high-stakes meetings with China, and negotiations with Canada and Mexico that could transform or dissolve the North American trade deal. Mr. Greer is often seen as a source of stability in the chaos. A former Mormon missionary and military lawyer, he has quietly navigated the demands of an unpredictable president, other big personalities in the cabinet, and the dozens of foreign leaders and company executives whose fortunes are tied up in trade. Friends say he has followed the advice of his mentor and former boss, Robert E. Lighthizer, who served as the U.S. trade representative in Mr. Trump’s first term: “You can get a lot done in Washington if you don’t care who gets the credit.” Mr. Greer’s small agency has only about 250 people, and he has not always been included in important administration decisions. In April, as he was testifying before Congress to defend the global tariffs Mr. Trump had just announced, the president surprised lawmakers and Mr. Greer by suddenly pausing them. But those close to Mr. Greer say he has built a solid relationship with the president. Mr. Trump has turned to him to coordinate issues beyond trade, like investment and security deals with Saudi Arabia, Cambodia and Thailand. Mr. Greer said that while he may not be a billionaire or political celebrity like other officials, he was chosen for a simple reason: “I know my brief.” Reading ‘Les Mis’ in Mortaritaville Image Mr. Greer during his time serving as a military lawyer in Iraq, where he was stationed at a base known as “Mortaritaville.” Credit... via the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative Mr. Greer is known as being preternaturally calm, a trait that some who know him say stems from being the father of five children. He credited his time as a military lawyer in Iraq, where he had to pause cross-examinations to shelter under a desk from mortar fire. “Listen, as long as nobody’s bombing me, I’m in good shape,” he said. Mr. Greer’s membership among Washington’s elite was not predictable. Raised in a working-class family in Paradise, Calif., he grew up in a mobile home, the fourth of five children, and worked during the summers and school year as a dishwasher and at McDonald’s. His parents valued education and Mr. Greer was drawn to the yellow-trimmed National Geographics that arrived in the mail each month. He attended Brigham Young University and served for two years during college as a Mormon missionary in Belgium, France and Luxembourg. In a white shirt and tie, Mr. Greer spent his days speaking to locals and refugees from Kosovo and Rwanda, an experience that opened his eyes to international relations and taught him fluent French that he still uses in trade negotiations. At B.Y.U., Mr. Greer joined the military and met his future wife, Marlo. After law school in Virginia and a stint studying in Paris, he served as a military lawyer in Kansas, Turkey and Iraq, where he was stationed at a base nicknamed “Mortaritaville,” reading “Les Misérables” in French between bombardments.

Credit... Rod Lamkey/Associated Press He was set on a path toward his future role as the architect of Mr. Trump’s trade strategy by what he called a “serendipitous” interview with Mr. Lighthizer for a job in Washington at the law firm Skadden Arps. Mr. Lighthizer said Mr. Greer impressed him as someone with “brains and values,” and hired Mr. Greer in 2012 to help the firm defend U.S. Steel and other American companies in trade cases. That work gave Mr. Greer an advance look at what U.S. industries would face in the coming years, as Chinese exports heavily subsidized by Beijing flooded global markets. Jeffrey Gerrish, who worked with Mr. Greer at Skadden Arps and at the trade representative’s office, said Mr. Greer was “right on the front lines” as Chinese goods began decimating U.S. industry. “He saw the kinds of impacts that it was having, not only on the companies, but on the workers and really entire communities,” Mr. Gerrish said. Mr. Greer saw the influx of cheap goods as a national security issue, but few Republicans or Democrats agreed. That changed with Mr. Trump’s election in 2016, when Mr. Lighthizer became U.S. trade representative and appointed Mr. Greer as his chief of s",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT President Trump repeatedly promised during his campaign that he would end the war in Ukraine in one day. But by most measures, the war has grown worse for Ukrainians since Mr. Trump returned to the White House, not better. More civilians were killed and injured in 2025 than in the previous year. More missiles and drones are hitting city centers. Russia captured more territory in its slow-moving advances in 2025 than in any year since 2022, when it launched its full-scale invasion. Moscow has practically destroyed Ukraine’s power grid during the country’s harshest winter in more than a decade. “It was a hard year — how else can you imagine it?” said Oleksandr Polishchuk, whose wife was one of 13 people killed when a missile slammed into their apartment building in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in April. “Shelling, having to go to work, dealing with household issues, no electricity, no heating. I think it was very hard, extremely hard.” After taking office in January 2025, Mr. Trump tossed out the American playbook for the war. He made overtures to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, the aggressor in the conflict and an avowed opponent of the West, while distancing the United States from Ukraine. U.S. aid to Ukraine fell by 99 percent in 2025 compared with the year before, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German research center. Mr. Trump stopped giving American weapons to Kyiv, unless it or its Western allies paid for them.

Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times At the same time, Russia increased its own production of missiles, drones, shells and mines. Moscow used the weapons at a rapid clip, in part to improve its position in talks pushed by Mr. Trump, who has made no secret of his desire to be credited with ending the war. Delegations from Russia, Ukraine and the United States are scheduled to hold the next round of negotiations on Tuesday and Wednesday in Geneva. As he has moved away from a Biden administration policy of isolating Mr. Putin, Mr. Trump has succeeded in getting Russia and Ukraine to talk about settlement terms, including in face-to-face meetings in recent weeks. Mr. Trump has largely set aside traditional diplomatic principles that he said had done nothing to end the war, turning instead to negotiators he sees as seasoned deal makers. He has also imposed sanctions that have reduced the oil revenue that fuels Moscow’s war machine. But Mr. Putin has slow-walked his way through the months of negotiations, using them to buy time to continue his assault. A year into Mr. Trump’s second term and almost four years after Russia’s invasion, Mr. Putin has signaled no retreat from his goals of taking more Ukrainian territory and imposing Russian dominance. The White House did not respond to a request for comment for this article. Mr. Trump has acknowledged that the war is much harder to resolve than he thought it would be. Ukrainian officials have argued that the American president would have to take stronger action for Mr. Putin to change his thinking. Strength is a quality that Mr. Trump prizes above most others. He has asserted that Mr. Putin “respects” him in a way he did not respect previous U.S. administrations, which he says gives him leverage. Mr. Trump has said numerous times that the war never would have happened had he been president when the full invasion began in 2022. But Mr. Trump has shown a deference to Mr. Putin that has assuredly not been lost on the Kremlin leader. Mr. Trump has called his relationship with Mr. Putin “fantastic” and has repeatedly said that Mr. Putin “wants peace.” Mr. Trump has at times accepted Mr. Putin’s rewriting of history, including by blaming President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine for starting the war. Image Residential buildings amid electrical failures in Kyiv last month. Moscow has practically destroyed Ukraine’s power grid during the country’s harshest winter in more than a decade. Credit... Lynsey Addario for The New York Times Outside of occasional public criticism and the oil sanctions, Mr. Putin has largely dodged Mr. Trump’s threats. In July, Mr. Trump said he would give Russia “about 10 or 12 days ” to end the war before imposing new sanctions. Mr. Trump then announced a summit with Mr. Putin in Alaska, and the deadline passed. A month later, Mr. Trump again threatened “massive sanctions.” But he also showed reporters a photograph sent to him by Mr. Putin of the two men in Alaska and called it a sign of honor and respect . All the while, Moscow’s attacks inflicted a growing toll on Ukrainians. In 2025, Russia killed more than 2,500 Ukrainian civilians, more than in any year since 2022 and a 20 percent increase from 2024, according to United Nations statistics . Russia sent more than 53,000 long-range drones to civilian targets in Ukraine in 2025, almost five times as many as in 2024, according to a data set created by The New York Times using numbers from the Ukrainian Air Force. Moscow is also increasingly firing on city centers with ballistic missiles, which move so quickly that air-defense systems have difficulty knocking them down. Russia has launched 154 of those missiles at Ukraine this year, according to the data set, about three times the number fired during the same period last year. Got a confidential news tip?

To lead the American delegation, Mr. Trump has chosen real-estate developers with a personal connection to him.

Mauricio Lima for The New York Times “There are no limits for Putin, because a human dimension is not a priority of these negotiations,” Ms. Matviichuk said. “The politicians discuss natural minerals, Russia’s territorial interests, even Putin’s vision of Ukrainian history, but they don’t speak about people at all.” This month, Ms. Matviichuk, who runs an organization that shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022 for documenting war crimes by Moscow, posed a question on Facebook : “Why has Trump’s year of negotiations been the deadliest for civilians in Ukraine since the full-scale invasion?” The post received thousands of reactions. One woman alluded to Mr. Trump’s publicly stated desire for his own Nobel, asking if he would be more loyal to Ukraine if she gave her prize to him. Many Ukrainians, however, see Mr. Trump as loyal only to himself, and they have feared that in his rush to end the war, he will force an unjust peace on Ukraine. Ukraine’s European allies have said that Russia cannot be rewarded for its aggression. But a 28-point peace plan drafted late last year by American and Russian envoys looked to Ukraine like a demand for surrender. Ukrainian negotiators raced to soften its provisions, and the diplomatic dance has continued for months. Image After an August strike in Kyiv.

Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 8:24 min Learn more Share full article By Erika Solomon Leily Nikounazar and Sanjana Varghese Produced by Jon Hazell Feb. 17, 2026 With patriotic anthems and chants against the country’s clerical rulers, Iranians on Tuesday began commemorating the end of a traditional 40-day mourning period for loved ones killed at the peak of the government’s bloody crackdown on nationwide protests. The authorities have moved quickly to tamp down protests or other demonstrations of anti-government sentiment to mark the occasion, with videos verified by The New York Times showing security patrols in at least two cities. Tuesday is the first of what are expected to be several days of memorial ceremonies across the country to honor the 40th day since thousands of protesters were killed from Jan. 8 to Jan. 10. The commemorations will test both of the success of the crackdown and the ability of government opponents to find new ways to defy the state. Such ceremonies have played a pivotal role in the country’s modern history: They were a staging ground for the protests that eventually overthrew Iran’s shah in 1979. This week may not be such a dramatic turning point, but dissidents are already using the occasion as a way to voice their anger at the government. Some are transforming what was once a somber, religious funeral rite into boisterous, celebratory affairs, in a stark rejection of the country’s austere rulers. Video “They’ve reinvented this with a revolutionary rage,” said Arash Azizi, a historian of Iran based in New York. “It is an attempt by Iranians to take back their country and rediscover their nationalism.” For weeks before the memorials began, security forces sought to intimidate some families into not holding public memorials, according to rights groups and relatives of several slain protesters interviewed by The New York Times. On Tuesday, videos verified by The Times showed security forces patrolling some towns, including Lesfijan in the north, where trucks filmed on the streets were loaded with troops wearing helmets and camouflage gear. Commemorations for the dead after 40 days have been at the heart of Iran’s mourning culture for generations — one of the final rituals of farewell before returning to the rhythms of daily life. The ceremonies are common among the region’s Shiite Muslims. They have pre-Islamic roots in Iran too, and are practiced by Iranians of all faiths. As a profound cultural symbol in Iran, the authorities this week appeared keen to control the memorials. The government itself announced plans for official mourning ceremonies in the capital, Tehran, and the northern city of Mashhad. “We are grieving for the blood that was shed,” the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in a speech on Tuesday. He called security forces killed in the unrest “the highest-ranking martyrs.” Bystanders and protesters who were “misled,” he said, were also martyrs. Others killed “were the very corrupters, the seditionists, and coup plotters themselves,” he said. “Their reckoning is with God. We have nothing to do with them.” Image A protest in Tehran in early January. Credit... Getty Images The government argues that it was fighting unrest during the protests that was fomented by “terrorists” backed by Israel and the United States, leading to more than 3,000 deaths. Rights groups say that vastly underestimates the toll, particularly from Jan. 8 to 10, which many now consider the bloodiest days in Iran’s modern history. Over a total of three weeks of protests, the U.S.-based rights group HRANA says more than 7,000 protesters were killed, with most killed in that three-day period. One of the victims was Robina Aminian, a 23-year-old fashion student, whose family said she was shot in the head while protesting in Tehran. Officials banned her family from public 40th-day memorials, according to her aunt, Hali Nouri, who lives in Europe. For more than a month, Ms. Nouri said, plainclothes police were stationed at either end of the alleyway where the Aminian family resides. Reaching Ms. Aminian’s grave will be particularly arduous for her family. Security forces have regularly forced families to bury dissidents in remote areas to prevent their graves from becoming a gathering point, and Ms. Aminian’s family was forced to lay her to rest in a remote, snowy village of western Iran. “My sister says, ‘Even if they shoot bullets, I will go for her 40th day,’” Ms. Nouri told The Times. Image Robina Aminian, right, with her aunt, Hali Nouri, who lives in Norway. Credit... via the Aminian family There are increasing signs of dissent across Iran in the face of the continuing crackdown. At several universities, students have repeatedly attempted to hold sit-ins, according to student social media channels. And in some cities, videos showed Iranians took to their rooftops in the cover of darkness to chant for the toppling of the supreme leader. On Monday night, a small protest broke out in the southwestern town of Abdanan. In one video verified by The Times, people can be seen chanting “death to Khamenei” as passing cars honk. Video Another video , which appeared to be from Tuesday morning, shows security forces deploying in the town with armored vehicles. Another video showed large crowds screaming as they fled smoke and detonations near a cemetery in Abdanan. New displays of defiance do not necessarily mean that momentum toward a new wave of nationwide protests is building, said Farzan Sabet, an analyst on Iran and Middle East politics at the Geneva Graduate Institute in Switzerland. “What I think everyone is waiting for is whether the other shoe will drop — that is, whether a U.S. strike will happen or not.” The severity of Iran’s crackdown is also partly a reaction to threats beyond its borders. President Trump has massed warships in Persian Gulf waters, a show of force amid tenuous U.S.-Iran talks over reining in Iran’s nuclear and military capabilities. A brief round of talks was held in Geneva on Tuesday. But the risk of another regional war looms. “Almost everyone is waiting for Trump’s promises to be carried out and for foreign help to arrive,” said Masoud, an accountant in Mashhad who did not want to be identified by his full name for fear of repercussions. “The people have done everything they could.” Some Iranians said they are trying to hold 40th-day commemorations despite the restrictions. The family of the slain 17-year-old protester Mohammad Mahdi Ganj Danesh, signed pledges not to chant political slogans at their memorial, according to a family friend. Still, the authorities refused to grant them permission to hold their memorial at their mosque in the northern town of Zanjan. They, like several other families interviewed, rented an event hall instead. Video of the memorial obtained by The Times shows large crowds crammed together to celebrate his life and protest against the government. “The fallen flower has become a gift to the homeland,” they chanted and clapped. Video Instead of tearful rituals of mourning, many families of those killed at protests have transformed their commemorations with dancing, singing and clapping over people’s graves. This is seen as a way of defying traditionally somber religious customs that many Iranians now associate with the Islamic Republic’s austere rule. Video of the 40th-day ceremony for Raha Bahlooli-Pour, a student at the University of Tehran, shows mourners playing folk tunes instead of the customary recitations of Quranic verse. In the video, verified by The Times, women perform the traditional kel, a high-pitched ululation most Iranians traditionally reserve for weddings. Reimagining mourning rituals has been a part of Iran’s culture at least since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, said Mr. Azizi, the historian. At the time, Islamic revolutionaries transformed 40th-day ceremonies from somber affairs to “rabble-rousing occasions.” After an anti-gover",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of Spain said on Tuesday that his government will ask prosecutors to investigate social media giants X, Meta and TikTok for allegedly spreading child sexual abuse material generated by artificial intelligence, the latest salvo in a Europe-wide effort to regulate big tech companies. “These platforms are undermining the mental health, dignity, and rights of our children,” Mr. Sánchez wrote on social media . “The state cannot allow this. The impunity of these giants must end.” X and TikTok did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Meta declined to comment. After the French police raided the Paris offices of X in connection with similar accusations, the company said it “categorically denies any wrongdoing.” The Spanish announcement intensifies a growing dispute between European governments and American tech companies , which have been backed by the Trump administration over efforts on the continent to limit the industry. The clash has revealed starkly different visions between the United States and its tech giants and the European Union and its member states over what counts as protected speech, and the role of corporations in guaranteeing the welfare of those affected by their platforms. Europe has become a central experiment for the ability of democratic governments to regulate and effectively penalize one of the world’s most dominant industries. In December, the European Union issued the first fine under its new Digital Services Act, penalizing X, the social media platform owned by Elon Musk, for 120 million euros, about $140 million , for violations. This month, French police searched the local offices of X as part of the French cybercrime division’s own investigation into the spread of child pornography and Holocaust denial on the site. Britain’s data protection regulator has also announced an investigation into X over sexually explicit images generated by its A.I. chatbot, Grok. Ireland’s Data Protection Commission also said on Tuesday that it had opened an investigation into whether Grok had allowed pornographic images of children to spread on the platform. European leaders say their efforts are aimed at protecting citizens from abuse, rather than an attempt — as American politicians and tech leaders have argued — to limit free speech. Mr. Sánchez, a left-wing leader who has not been shy about challenging Mr. Trump or the American tech giants, asked prosecutors to “investigate the crimes that X, Meta, and TikTok may be committing through the creation and dissemination of child pornography using their AI.” This month, Spain joined France , Denmark and Australia in seeking to ban social media for children under the age of 16 , with Mr. Sánchez saying, “We will protect them from the digital Wild West.” His government’s proposed ban still requires parliamentary approval. But the proposed measure, and Mr. Sánchez referring to “crimes committed” by Grok, immediately triggered a vulgar and personally targeted attack against Mr. Sánchez by Mr. Musk. Some Spanish political analysts suggested that it was just the reaction hoped for by Mr. Sánchez, who has sought to position himself as a liberal leader on a global stage as he faces deep political divisions and scandals at home.

Feb. 17, 2026 Leer en español The square started filling well before dawn. Some revelers arrived clad in neon fishnets and doused in glitter. Others, who had been at parties elsewhere, napped on a grassy patch. The musicians came last, lugging drums and trumpets. It was Sunday morning during carnival in Rio de Janeiro, and the square in the city’s historic center was the setting for the start of a kind of roving marathon block party known as the Boi Tolo. The Boi Tolo has no set time, script or route, a swell of thousands of euphoric revelers marching through the city at a frantic pace. Those who miss the start spend the day trying to catch up, firing off messages in group chats: “Where is Boi Tolo?” Keeping pace is grueling. “Along the way, you start wondering, ‘Should I give up? I’m going to give up,’” said Lucas Fagundes, 35. “It’s like the ultimate test of your stamina.” The Boi Tolo has no set time, script or route. Few parties represent the fervor and chaos of Rio’s street carnival scene better than the Boi Tolo. Far from the glamour of official carnival parades, it has come to embody the gritty informal celebrations that take over the streets. By 6:50 a.m. on Sunday, the crowd at the square had grown to a few hundred people clad in bejeweled cowboy hats and shimmering bikinis. The musicians erupted in an improvised symphony of brass, drums and percussion instruments. A giant human chain formed around the band and everyone set off through the narrow streets, paralyzing traffic. As they passed a tram stop, a shiny Medusa blew soap bubbles toward commuters. Stilt walkers passed a bus stuck in the sea of people. One of the few rules of Boi Tolo is to keep moving. Whenever anyone stopped for an impassioned kiss, the crowd erupted: “Kiss and walk! Kiss and walk!” The direction is not always clear. “We decide the route in the moment,” said Luís Otávio Almeida, 62, one of the party’s founders. The Boi Tolo started by chance two decades ago, when a group of people arrived at a public square during carnival Sunday ready to party, but found no party, apparently misled by a newspaper announcement. One of the few rules of Boi Tolo is to keep moving. Frustrated, they decided to improvise. A beer vendor nearby had a tambourine. Someone called a friend with a drum. A lone trumpeter showed up, joining the group. Then, a reveler picked up a piece of cardboard and in lipstick scribbled “Boi Tolo,” or “foolish bull” (for their falling for the faulty announcement). The tradition stuck and it now draws tens of thousands of people each year. “Boi Tolo only exists because people want it to exist,” Mr. Almeida said. “Carnival is made on the streets. It’s made by the people.” This year’s party eventually spilled into a sprawling park, where costumed spectators hung off tree branches and squeezed under an overpass, as hundreds of people cheered above. To many “Cariocas,” as people from Rio are known, carnival is often akin to an extreme sport that requires grit and endurance. In recent years, growing numbers of visitors and searing temperatures have made it harder for even the most resilient to party hard. To try to beat the heat, Boi Tolo set out earlier than usual this year. Still, as temperatures topped 90 degrees, people fanned themselves and doused each other with water. By 11 a.m., the sun was scorching; a stilt walker in a sequin bikini crumpled to the ground. “I’m fine, my blood pressure just dropped,” she said, as she got up and started twerking again. Boi Tolo participants proceeding through a tunnel near the beach. The procession headed toward a pair of tunnels leading to Rio’s beachfront. Most participants were drenched in sweat, their makeup melting. But this is what they had been waiting for; the highlight of Boi Tolo. The beat quickened, echoing through the tunnel. The crowd burst into euphoric jubilation. “It’s magical,” said Perola Mendonça, 26. “It’s this incredible feeling of ecstasy.” On the other end, the party kept moving along the beachfront. By 4:30 p.m., the participants reached the end of the boardwalk, but they weren’t ready to stop. So they turned around and headed back toward the tunnel. After a 12-hour march through the city, a few hundred partygoers were still not ready to quit. With the light fading, they made their way back toward the city center where it all started. As they passed a stretch of beach they rushed onto the sand. A man in a cowboy hat hooked his snare drum on the crossbar of a goal post. The crowd closed in, as the musicians started playing a party anthem with lyrics the crowd could relate to. “I’m not going home! I’m not going home!” the revelers belted out, jumping up and down in the sand. Exhausted, Yasmin Santiago, 22, leaned on the goal post. She had joined a few hours earlier, not knowing what it was but eager to party. “This is Boi Tolo? No way!” Ms. Santiago said when she found out, her face lighting up. Turning to her friend, she called out: “Girl, did you hear that? We found Boi Tolo!We were looking for it for ages.” Image Some Boi Tolo revelers had waited all night for the festivities to begin. A correction was made on Feb. 17, 2026 : An earlier version of a picture caption misstated which revelers were shown.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The fans next to the Olympic sliding track oohed and aahed with each sharp turn. They admired the navigational precision and soft landing. They shouted, “You’re No. 1!” They were cheering for a drone pilot. “I’m almost feeling like I am with the athletes on the tracks,” said Ralph Hogenbirk, the pilot operating one of the many drones that have become the buzzing — and, for some, unsettling — soundtrack of the 2026 Winter Olympics. The robotic wasps chase behind lugers, skeleton pilots and bobsledders bombing down the ice track in Cortina d’Ampezzo. They are in hot pursuit of alpine skiers in the mountains of Bormio and record-shattering speedskaters gliding around the rinks in Milan, transporting viewers at home to the slopes and ice. All of their unerring following has earned them a following of their own. One night last week in Cortina, a small crowd gathered outside a white tent, cordoned off between a red tractor and heaps of dirty snow, a few yards below the start gate for the skeleton race. Inside, Mr. Hogenbirk sat in a corner, a visor over his eyes, piloting his nearly nine-ounce drone. It hovered behind the skeleton athletes as they collected themselves, crept behind them as they began their mad dash to start the race and then picked up speed, whirring behind the competitors as they shot down the track’s first curves. Image A drone during the men’s moguls finals on Sunday in Livigno, Italy. Credit... Gabriela Bhaskar/The New York Times A screen in the tent showed the drone’s flight path, including when it left the track after the initial curves. It veered left and looped back over construction sites, parking lots, roped-off icy areas and into the cradled hands, red with cold, of Mr. Hogenbirk’s technician. “Very cool,” said Mary-Anne Grotheer, 33, the wife of a skeleton competitor who left the races to watch the drones come and go. Italians shouted, “Bravissimo!” and inquired about the drone’s specs. Germans appreciated its engineering. A group of British fans didn’t know what to think. “What the hell?” said Oliver Dickie, 26, a lawyer from London, as the returning drone, its green light blinking in the night, buzzed by on the way back to the tent. He said he imagined it improved the experience for spectators watching at home but wondered “how scary this would be” to be tracked by one. Athletes said not very. “I actually didn’t know they were there,” said skier Lara Markthaler, 19, of South Africa, who competed in the women’s giant slalom on Sunday. She said she had a tougher time with “the start camera like 10 centimeters from our face. That is what we do notice.” Others couldn’t wait to ski with Skynet .

James Hill for The New York Times “I saw the other competitors have drones and I was like, ‘Wow, that’s so cool, and I want to have that for my run,’” said Elin Van Pelt of Iceland, 20. She added with a laugh that having a drone follow her run for a television audience would mean, “I made it.” Drones have been used at the Olympics since the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, but have become increasingly common as the technology improves and sports audiences grow more used to up-close action. In these Games, drones are being called on to do more than ever before. Mr. Hogenbirk, a founder of the company Dutch Drone Gods, which has a background in professional drone racing, said that pilots of the drones had made sure the athletes were comfortable with them before the Games began. “Maybe they hear it a little bit, but it’s not distracting because they’re so fully focused on where they’re going,” said Mr. Hogenbirk. He said that his team had filmed each athlete before the Games, and that “everyone had a chance to say, ‘No, I don’t want this.’ None of them did.” Mr. Hogenbirk was speaking outside the tent, where he came to greet his adoring fans after his shift had ended. “People are just like filming and zooming in with their phones,” he said, adding that when the drones land people sometimes cheer, “Olympic medal!” Among the drone spectators was Kate Bentley, 26, a data analyst from Bristol, England. She was on a ski trip with friends and decided to check out the Olympics, she said, but found the skeleton athletes whooshing by her at about 90 miles per hour less than riveting. “I think skeleton could be a bit boring,” she said, “without the drones.” Jason Horowitz is the Madrid bureau chief for The Times, covering Spain, Portugal and the way people live throughout Europe.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Indirect talks between American and Iranian officials in Switzerland ended on Tuesday with an agreement on a “set of guiding principles,” according to Iran’s foreign minister, who said both sides had agreed to exchange drafts on a potential deal. The foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, was as positive as he was vague, providing little clarity on what had been discussed or when the next round of discussions might be held. American officials did not immediately comment publicly on the talks, but one U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations, said the two sides had made progress. The official said the Iranians would provide more detailed proposals in the next two weeks to address some of the gaps between the United States and Iran, but did not provide any specifics. Mr. Araghchi told Iranian state television that the talks, which were held in Geneva and lasted about three hours, had been “more constructive” and had made “good progress” compared with a previous round of negotiations in Oman this month. “We now have a clear path ahead, which in my view is positive,” he said. But Mr. Araghchi said a deal was not imminent, as the Middle East remained on edge over the possibility of an American attack should negotiations collapse. Iran has insisted that the talks be strictly limited to its nuclear program, even as U.S. officials have said they would push to curb the range of Iran’s ballistic missiles and its support of militias across the region. Mr. Araghchi did not address those points in his comments to Iranian state television, saying only that the two sides had reached a “general understanding on a set of guiding principles” to continue discussions and to “move toward drafting the text of a possible agreement.” “This does not mean that we can reach an agreement quickly, but at least the path has begun,” he said. Three Iranian officials familiar with the talks said that Iran had indicated a willingness to suspend nuclear enrichment for three to five years — which would cover the duration of Mr. Trump’s presidency — and then join a regional consortium for civilian grade enrichment. Iran would also dilute its stockpile of uranium on its own soil in the presence of international inspectors. In exchange, Iran has demanded that the United States lift financial and banking sanctions and the embargo on its oil sales. The officials, who asked not to be identified to discuss sensitive negotiations, said Iran was also dangling financial incentives and opportunities for investments and trade with the United States, including in Iran’s oil and energy sectors. The negotiations were hosted at the Omani ambassador’s residence by Oman’s foreign minister, Badr Albusaidi, who mediated the previous round of talks. A spokesman for Iran’s foreign ministry said ahead of the talks that Omani officials would shuttle between the two sides. Mr. Albusaidi said on social media after the talks that they had concluded “with good progress towards identifying common goals and relevant technical issues.” “Together we made serious efforts to define a number of guiding principles for a final deal,” he added. “Much work is yet to be done.” Steve Witkoff, the Middle East envoy, and Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law, had been expected to attend the negotiations, according to two U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy. Mr. Trump, speaking on Monday on Air Force One, said he would be involved in the talks “indirectly” and that they would be “very important.” He said Iran wanted to make a deal. The American president has ordered a buildup of U.S. forces in the region — including two aircraft carriers — after vowing last month to aid antigovernment demonstrators in Iran. The Iranian government quelled those protests in a bloody crackdown that killed thousands, according to rights groups. Now, Mr. Trump is calling on Iran to reach a deal to limit its nuclear and military capabilities or face a possible attack. Last week, he wrote on social media that he preferred a deal with Iran, but that if one could not be brokered, “we will just have to see what the outcome will be.” Countries in the region worry that a potential American strike, and an Iranian retaliation that could draw in Israel, could destabilize the Middle East and endanger U.S. allies in the Arab world that host American soldiers. In a speech on Tuesday shortly after the talks began, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, responded defiantly to Mr. Trump’s orders to send a second aircraft carrier to the region. “An aircraft carrier is certainly a dangerous piece of equipment,” the ayatollah said. “But more dangerous than the carrier is the weapon that can send it to the bottom of the sea.” He also called demands to limit the range of Iran’s ballistic missiles “illogical,” arguing that such demands interfered with his nation’s right to possess weapons of self-defense. “Any country without deterrent weapons will be crushed under the feet of its enemies,” he said. On Tuesday, Iranian naval forces closed parts of the Strait of Hormuz, a key global shipping lane, for several hours to conduct a second day of naval “war games,” according to the semiofficial Tasnim news agency. The Iranian government is under considerable pressure to agree to a deal. Iran’s economy has struggled under crippling international sanctions, which helped ignite the latest wave of protests against the country’s authoritarian government. Iranian officials have argued they will not make concessions on nuclear enrichment without sanctions relief. Iran’s deputy foreign minister told state media that in return Tehran could offer Washington lucrative investment opportunities in sectors like oil, gas and mining. Last year, U.S. and Iranian officials tried to negotiate a nuclear deal that would end the sanctions, but Israel launched a military campaign against the Iranian nuclear program as the talks were underway, leading to a 12-day war between the two countries. U.S. stealth bombers joined the Israeli assault, attacking three Iranian nuclear sites. Mr. Trump initially said that the U.S. bombing had obliterated Iran’s nuclear program, but American intelligence later said that it had been badly damaged , not destroyed. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who met with Mr. Trump last week in Washington, said on Sunday that the American president believed that Iran “must surely understand that they missed out last time” by not showing more flexibility in the 2025 talks. “He thinks there is a serious probability that they won’t miss out this time,” Mr. Netanyahu told a group of American Jewish leaders in Jerusalem, although he added that he was far more skeptical of “any deal with Iran.” Tyler Pager contributed reporting from Washington, and Farnaz Fassihi from New York.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT A senior official for Gaza on President Trump’s “Board of Peace” met with a top Hamas leader last week and pressed the militant group on the issue of disarmament, according to two officials briefed on the encounter, amid concern that Israel may return to war. The direct talks between Nickolay Mladenov, a former United Nations envoy serving as the board’s “high representative” for Gaza, and Khalil al-Hayya, the chief Hamas negotiator, underscored that the group remains a key actor in Gaza’s postwar transition. The board, a new international body with a mandate to secure peace in conflict zones, is set to have its inaugural meeting in Washington on Thursday. Officials from the board are finalizing a demilitarization plan that they hope will be acceptable to both Israel and Hamas, allowing the group to keep some small arms , at least initially. Yet Mr. al-Hayya refused to discuss demilitarization with Mr. Mladenov, the officials said, during their meeting in Cairo. It was unclear why he did not engage on the subject. In an interview with Al Jazeera that aired on Dec. 10, Khaled Meshal, a Qatar-based Hamas leader, said that to take away weapons from Palestinians was to take away their soul. Mr. Trump’s 20-point peace plan , which paved the way for the October cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, calls on the group to give up its weapons, but members of its leadership have not publicly agreed to that demand. On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested that if Hamas failed to give up its weapons, Israel would refuse to move to the next phase of the cease-fire. That phase is widely expected to involve Israel further withdrawing its forces from Gaza and facilitating efforts for reconstruction in the territory. “Hamas must first be disarmed and then Gaza must be demilitarized,” Mr. Netanyahu told a conference in Jerusalem, adding that the group still holds 60,000 Kalashnikov assault rifles. Yossi Fuchs, the Israeli government’s cabinet secretary, said on Monday that if Hamas does not disarm, the military will need to return to “complete the mission” in Gaza. In the past, talks between Hamas and the United States have mostly been conducted through Qatari and Egyptian mediators. The direct talks suggest that Board of Peace officials are urgently pushing for a breakthrough on demilitarization. A representative for Mr. Mladenov did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Hamas’s media office. Mr. Mladenov was asked on Friday about demilitarization while speaking at the Munich Security Conference and said, “The reality is that all of this needs to move very fast.” He went on to say there was a risk the cease-fire could collapse, leading to a return to war. Image Nickolay Mladenov, a former United Nations envoy serving as the board’s “high representative” for Gaza, talking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month. Credit... Evan Vucci/Associated Press For Hamas, armed struggle against Israel is a core part of its ideology, and even discussing demilitarization has caused fissures among the group. Despite the apparent deadlock, Mr. Trump has projected optimism about the Board of Peace’s efforts in Gaza. Writing on social media on Sunday, he said that member states had pledged more than $5 billion toward “Humanitarian and Reconstruction efforts” and committed thousands of troops “to maintain Security and Peace for Gazans.” Senior officials from board member states are expected to announce pledges at the inaugural meeting later this week and discuss the humanitarian situation in Gaza. More than 20 countries have so far joined the board. Some European countries have expressed reservations about the board’s mandate, which extends to conflicts beyond Gaza, and U.S. allies including the United Kingdom and Germany have declined an invitation to join. Analysts have cautioned that the president may be attempting to establish a rival to the United Nations, with himself at the helm. Aaron Boxerman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Dressed all in black with her dark hair pulled tightly into a bun, the Russian teenager many in the figure skating world have been wondering about finally showed up in Milan on Monday. A day before she began competition at the Winter Olympics, the young woman, 18-year-old Adeliia Petrosian, practiced for the first time at the official training rink. A swarm of camera lenses followed her as she glided across the ice. She landed jump after jump, easily turning her 5-foot body into a tiny rotating rocket. Afterward, she scurried past reporters, stopping only long enough to say in Russian, “Mood is excellent!” As the Olympic women’s figure skating competition begins on Tuesday, Petrosian is a contender for the gold medal — under the cloud of the biggest doping scandal in her sport’s history. Yet she is relatively unknown outside Russia because the country’s athletes were barred from international competition in 2022 over its invasion of Ukraine. The Winter Games will be just her second senior-level event outside Russia since then. “I can tell you that none of us have any idea how she will do, and she doesn’t have any idea, either,” said Adam Rippon, who won Olympic bronze for the United States in 2018 and coached at the 2022 Beijing Games. “But it’s kind of sad to think about that, if she does win a medal, how that will reflect on the sport.” Petrosian has the résumé of a potential medalist: Three-time and reigning Russian women’s national champion. A history of landing quadruple jumps, the hardest in skating. A coach who churns out Olympic champions, including Russians who have won gold at the last three Winter Games. But that coach was also at the center of scandal four years ago , when one of her charges, the 15-year-old Russian skater Kamila Valieva, failed a drug test and threw the Beijing Olympics into chaos. Valieva, one of Petrosian’s training mates, tested positive for the heart medication trimetazidine, which is banned because it is thought to increase stamina and endurance. She claimed that her grandfather had accidentally contaminated her strawberry dessert with his medication. Her failed drug test led to Russia being stripped of the team gold medal, and she served a four-year ban for doping. Even though Valieva was underage at the time, the rest of her team — including her coach, Eteri Tutberidze, and her choreographer, Daniil Gleikhengauz — were spared punishment. Image Eteri Tutberidze, right, and Daniil Gleikhengauz, who is listed as Petrosian’s official coach at the Olympics. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times There is no record of Petrosian testing positive and she has not been implicated in doping. But she and Valieva shared the same coaches, choreographer and training site in Moscow, where, according to findings by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, a medical team administered 56 different medications and dietary supplements to Valieva over two years, starting when she was 13. Now Petrosian is carrying the hopes of her country, one that is eager to re-enter the Olympic fold and rebound from a series of sanctions that have been imposed on it since the revelation of a government-sponsored doping scheme at the 2014 Winter Games. She is the sole Russian skater in the women’s event, but she isn’t officially representing her country. She is competing as a “neutral athlete,” like 13 other Russians at the Games. Though some international sports federations stood by their bans on Russian athletes for the Olympics in Italy, the International Skating Union, figure skating’s governing body, allowed two Russians to compete as neutrals: Petrosian and Petr Gumennik, who finished sixth in the men’s event last week. Last September, Petrosian won an Olympic qualifying event in Beijing, her international debut as a senior-level skater. Her choreographer, Gleikhengauz, was barred from that event for failing to pass the I.S.U. screening for neutrality, which means that it found indications that he supported the invasion of Ukraine, according to a person with knowledge of the ban who was not authorized to speak on behalf of the federation. Tutberidze did not apply to be Petrosian’s coach at that event or at the Olympics, the person said. An International Olympic Committee panel subsequently cleared Petrosian and Gleikhengauz to participate in the Milan-Cortina Games, where he is her official coach, according to the I.O.C. The organization did not immediately return a request for comment about why it cleared Gleikhengauz to coach in Milan after the I.S.U. had not cleared him for the qualifying event. Madison Chock and Evan Bates, the U.S. ice dancing team that won silver in Milan last week, were not awarded their gold medal for the team event in 2022 until the Summer Games two years later because Valieva’s doping case dragged on so long. But Bates said he supported the inclusion of Russian athletes at these Olympics. “In the spirit of the Games and fair play, I think there should be, in some regard, an avenue for those kinds of athletes,” he said. Still, skepticism surrounds Petrosian’s participation. Before she entered the Olympic drug-testing pool last May, the Russian antidoping agency was responsible for testing her for performance-enhancing drugs, the international skating federation said. But the World Anti-Doping Agency, the global body charged with ensuring fair competition in Olympic sports, does not recognize the Russian agency because it has failed to follow WADA rules. Image Adeliia Petrosian at the Russian Figure Skating Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, last year. Credit... Anton Vaganov/Reuters Since last May, Petrosian also has been drug tested by the International Testing Agency, which was formed after Russia’s state-sponsored cheating program was uncovered and is also responsible for testing athletes during the Games, the I.S.U. said. But some experts say questions around Petrosian and some other Russian athletes remain because the effects of doping can last years. “Russia remains noncompliant with WADA rules for its state-sponsored doping, but their athletes get waived through to the Games?” said Travis Tygart, chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency. “It’s exactly why athletes, fans and sponsors have lost confidence.” Tutberidze, a dual citizen of Russia and Georgia, is officially the coach of a male Georgian skater in Milan. But she was at the practice rink on Monday when Petrosian skated, looking very much like her coach. Witold Banka, the president of WADA, said that there was no legal basis to bar Tutberidze from coaching in Milan because an investigation into Valieva’s entourage found no proof of wrongdoing. But he added: “I don’t feel comfortable with her presence here.” Tutberidze, who ignored several interview requests, has a reputation for pushing young skaters so hard that they burn out early and sustain injuries, and for berating Valieva on live television four years ago. Entangled in the doping scandal, Valieva stumbled through her long program at the Beijing Games and finished in tears. Television cameras captured the moments afterward, when a grim-faced Tutberidze offered the teen scathing words. “Why did you stop fighting?” she said. Thomas Bach, the I.O.C. president at the time, said he was “very, very disturbed” to see Valieva being treated with “such coldness.” Image Kamila Valieva with her coach, Tutberidze, before her performance at the 2022 Beijing Olympics. Credit... Chang W. Lee/The New York Times In interviews and on social media, Petrosian has had nothing but praise for her coaches. She and Gleikhengauz were featured in a recent Russian edition of Marie Claire magazine, in which they discussed fashion — Petrosian’s style trends toward that of Audrey Hepburn and of Zendaya — and the importance of trust between an athlete and coach. Petrosian said she had dreamed of training with Tutberidze and her staff before she joined them at about age 12, and that",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT A judge in New Zealand who discovered last week that apology letters from a defendant in an arson case had been written with the help of artificial intelligence raised questions about the sincerity of her sentiments. “The issue of remorse is interesting,” said the judge, Tom Gilbert, of the district court in Christchurch, as he mulled the punishment of a woman who had pleaded guilty to arson and other charges. Remorse can be a mitigating factor in sentencing. Her letters to the victims and the court were nicely written, the judge said. He decided to do some sleuthing. “Out of curiosity I punched into two A.I. tools ‘draft me a letter for a judge expressing remorse for my offending,’” the judge said, according to a transcript of the sentencing hearing that was shared with The New York Times. “It became immediately apparent that these were two A.I.-generated letters, albeit with tweaks around the edges.” The case illustrates a global debate about using machines for meaningful communication. Judge Gilbert said he was not criticizing the defendant’s use of A.I. “But certainly when one is considering the genuineness of an individual’s remorse, simply producing a computer-generated letter does not really take me anywhere as far as I am concerned,” he said, according to the transcript. The judge was not alone in wrestling with the question of authenticity in A.I.-assisted writing in the case before him, which was initially reported by The New Zealand Herald . Increasingly, people are outsourcing many tasks to machines, including writing apologies , eulogies and wedding vows , perhaps saving precious time but also inviting the ire of some of their fellow humans. Growing reliance on A.I. has led some cultural commentators to bemoan “ the rise of the LLeMmings,” people who depend on large language models known as LLMs to aid much of their thinking and production, including in their personal lives . Social scientists say the questions raised by use of these tools go beyond etiquette. “It’s a mirror into who we are and what we care about as humans,” Jim A.C. Everett, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Kent in Britain, said in an email about the case in New Zealand and his own work on what is described as the “outsourcing penalty.” Dr. Everett worked on a series of recent studies on the perception of A.I. use and users. Generative A.I. tools like ChatGPT are promoted as time savers that produce better work faster, experts say. But people apparently believe that certain activities should take work in order to seem genuine, and more personal A.I.-generated efforts are received particularly poorly, his research suggests. Across the six studies Dr. Everett worked on, 4,000 participants were asked about 20 tasks — including writing computer code, concocting recipes and drafting love letters and apologies. The aim was to understand how people perceive those who use A.I. and how that perception might shift depending on the activity and the way the tools were used. “A.I. is a tool for efficiency, and it can be helpful, but it also typically involves, and signals, reduced effort,” Dr. Everett said. But the use of such tools acts as a kind of proxy for character traits, the researchers found. The findings, published in the journal Computers in Human Behavior , suggest that people generally perceived those using A.I. as lazier, less competent and less trustworthy, and their work as less meaningful and authentic. “When you spend time crafting a piece of writing or completing a task yourself, others can assume that message reflects your priorities: that what you write is authentically yours and represents what you care about,” Dr. Everett said. The situation in the New Zealand courtroom was a real-life test of the sentiments and perceptions that he and his fellow researchers sought to identify and understand. “An A.I. could be perfectly trained on all apologies that a person has ever written, but one might still think that a specific apology it then generates in a new instance is not an authentic apology because it does not come from the kind of processes deemed important in an apology: a personal recollection of the wrong, a commitment to change,” the study said. The study detected a difference in how people perceived using A.I. for social tasks, like writing a love letter, versus a practical tasks, like writing computer code. The more personal a task the more negative was their impression. Judge Gilbert ultimately said he was willing to give the defendant some credit for genuine remorse, looking beyond the letters. But he granted only a 5 percent reduction in the sentence instead of the 10 percent the defense lawyer had requested based on the defendant’s remorse. “I do not consider this is a case where 10 percent is justified and, indeed, 5 percent might be viewed as reasonably generous,” Judge Gilbert concluded. In the end, he sentenced the defendant to 27 months in prison. Ephrat Livni is a Times reporter covering breaking news around the world. She is based in Washington.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Belgium’s government summoned President Trump’s ambassador after he accused his host nation of an antisemitic action and criticized a Belgian official in a series of posts on social media. The meeting on Tuesday between the ambassador, Bill White, and a representative from Belgium’s foreign office came at a moment of heightened tension as the Trump administration paints governments across Europe as out of line with American values. Mr. White criticized Belgium on Monday on social media over an investigation in Antwerp into a few Jewish mohels who perform ritual circumcision, and who the authorities say may be carrying out procedures without medical training . Mr. White wrote on X that Belgium should drop what he called a “RIDICULOUS AND ANTI SEMITIC ‘PROSECUTION.’” He tagged Mr. Trump and the American vice president and the secretary of state, among others. “You must make a legal provision to allow Jewish religious MOHELS to perform their duties here in Belgium,” Mr. White added, addressing the Belgian health minister. Circumcision is far less common in Europe than in the United States and Israel and different countries regulate it in different ways. In Belgium, laws mandate that all medical procedures must be performed by a licensed doctor, said Arne Brinckman, a representative for Belgium’s health minister. The Antwerp public prosecutor’s office put out a news release about the case in May and confirmed on Tuesday that the investigation was continuing. Kristof Aerts, a representative for the office, did not elaborate but noted that there were no “ongoing prosecutions.” Maxime Prévot, Belgium’s foreign minister, responded at length to Mr. White on X, saying that “personal attacks against a Belgian minister and interference in judicial matters violate basic diplomatic norms.” “Any suggestion that Belgium is antisemitic is false, offensive, and unacceptable,” Mr. Prévot wrote in the post, on Monday evening. A statement from the Belgian foreign ministry after the meeting — which included Mr. White and Theodora Gentzis, the secretary general of the Belgian foreign ministry — underlined its stance. Mr. Prévot was not present because he is traveling, Mr. White said and Mr. Prévot’s office confirmed. “Belgium attaches great importance to its relations with the United States of America. This partnership remains essential and we remain open to dialogue,” the statement said. “However, this dialogue must be based on respect for our institutions and our sovereignty.” On Tuesday morning, Gideon Sa’ar, Israel’s foreign minister, also weighed in on social media. “I understand that the mirror Ambassador @BillWhiteUSA has held up to you is unpleasant, but one might want to take this opportunity to take a hard look in that mirror and acknowledge reality,” he wrote. Mr. White said in an interview that he does not think Belgium is antisemitic. He said he had previously held private conversations about the issue with Belgian officials, and was frustrated by the slow progress. He said that he does not want the government to interfere in the judicial system by forcing it to drop the case, but that he would like government officials to speak in support of the men under investigation. Most governments in Europe and other democracies avoid becoming involved in their judicial systems, out of deference to judicial independence. Mr. White noted that Charles Kushner, Mr. Trump’s ambassador to France, faced a similar summons last year after complaining about what Mr. Kushner characterized as France’s failure to stem antisemitism in a letter to President Emmanuel Macron. The French foreign ministry denied the accusations. Mr. White said his own meeting with the foreign ministry was “very nice.” “I did not apologize for anything,” Mr. White said. “Nor would I.” Jeanna Smialek is the Brussels bureau chief for The Times.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Palmerston, a cat who served as the “chief mouser” for Britain’s diplomatic service, has died in Bermuda. He was about 12. “Palmerston, Diplocat extraordinaire, passed away peacefully,” his social media account announced on Friday , a day after he died. “He was a wonderful companion, with a gentle nature, and will be sorely missed.” “Farewell Palmerston, with love and thanks,” the Foreign Office wrote in a separate tribute on social media, acknowledging his work as a “feline diplomat.” Palmerston was born in 2013, according to the Foreign Office, and was named after Lord Palmerston, the 19th-century foreign secretary and two-time prime minister. The cat was adopted in 2016 from the Battersea Cats and Dogs Home, an animal rescue center in London, after he had spent a rough time on the streets: “He was hungry, underweight and had no microchip,” the BBC reported . He was initially tasked with dealing with mice in the Foreign Office’s Victorian-era headquarters in London, one of the British government’s grandest buildings. But he became a social media star, eventually amassing almost 100,000 followers on X — more than many British ambassadors have. He even dressed for the part. Famously, he never took off his tuxedo. A few months after Palmerston was adopted, Britain voted to leave the European Union, a decision that led to a period of political turmoil. On the ground, Palmerston kept calm and carried on catching mice. On social media, he was a friendly face for the country through his regular updates. During the coronavirus pandemic, Palmerston was eventually moved out of central London and formally retired to the countryside in 2020, with Andrew Murdoch, who worked in the Foreign Office alongside the cat. In Palmerston’s farewell letter to Simon McDonald, then the top civil servant at the Foreign Office, Palmerston revealed himself to be a master diplomat or even spy by admitting to “pretending to be asleep while overhearing all the foreign dignitaries’ conversations.” Last February, Palmerston wrote on X that he had come out of retirement to take up a new posting as a “feline relations consultant” in Bermuda with Mr. Murdoch. It was a good gig for an aging cat. Palmerston described his work as “feline relations consultant (semi-retired).” There, he “gave audiences to visitors between well-deserved naps,” the office of the governor said on social media . Many will miss him. But perhaps no one understood him better than Larry the Cat , the chief mouser at No. 10 Downing Street, the prime minister’s official residence, who has almost 900,000 followers on social media. At first, the two did not get along. Video footage taken soon after Palmerston arrived at the Foreign Office showed the cats in the sort of heated confrontation more commonly seen between politicians than civil servants. Larry was once spotted with a limp after reports that Palmerston had clawed him. But the two appeared to have repaired their relationship after Palmerston moved out of London. Last week, Larry joined the nation in mourning his old rival after a life of service for Queen, King and country. “Farewell old friend,” he wrote on social media.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Ukrainian and Russian officials began a new round of U.S.-brokered peace talks on Tuesday in Switzerland, though hopes of a breakthrough to end the war were low. Fighting rages on, past negotiations have produced little, and major hurdles to a deal are unresolved. The talks, which were held Tuesday afternoon and will run through Wednesday, were the third trilateral meeting between Ukrainian, Russian and American negotiators in roughly three weeks. Ukraine and Russia have described two previous rounds of discussions in the United Arab Emirates as productive. But those talks delivered scant progress beyond a prisoner-of-war exchange. The conflict will enter its fifth year later this month as Russia continues to strike Ukraine’s power grid , including in an attack on Tuesday involving nearly 40 missiles and 400 drones, according to the Ukrainian Air Force . Kyiv and Moscow are still far apart on the core obstacles to a peace deal: the fate of Ukrainian-held territory in the east that Russia wants — an issue expected to dominate this week’s talks — and the question of postwar Western security guarantees to deter another Russian invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine underscored those differences in social media posts on Monday, warning that it would be “a big mistake to allow the aggressor to take something” — an apparent reference to Russia’s demand for the eastern territories. He also urged the United States to advance work on security guarantees, which has been complicated by Moscow’s insistence that such guarantees must exclude Western troop deployments in Ukraine. Rustem Umerov, the head of the Ukrainian delegation and the secretary of the country’s National Security Council, published pictures on social media that showed him seated at a table with other Ukrainian officials, including Kyrylo Budanov , Mr. Zelensky’s chief of staff. To their right, according to the pictures, sat American mediators, including Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s special envoy; and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law. Both had just wrapped up talks focused on Iran that were also held in Geneva. Facing the Ukrainians was the Russian delegation, which included Vladimir Medinsky, a top Kremlin aide, as well as military intelligence figures, according to the pictures. The presence of Mr. Medinsky, a former culture minister and amateur historian who led negotiations for Moscow last year , has been seen by some in Ukraine as a discouraging signal. In previous talks, Mr. Medinsky grated on his Ukrainian counterparts with lengthy historical lectures and a hard-line stance, warning that Russia was prepared to keep fighting indefinitely. Image From right, President Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, the president’s special envoy, in Paris last month. Credit... Michel Euler/Associated Press Mr. Medinsky was absent from the two trilateral meetings this year in the United Arab Emirates, where Russia was represented by security and military intelligence officials — a shift that Ukrainian officials said helped improve the tone of the talks. “These are different people, and there were no more pseudohistorical lectures,” Andrii Sybiha, Ukraine’s foreign minister, told Ukrainian media last month after the first trilateral meeting. “The conversations were very focused.” Those meetings focused on the mechanics of a cease-fire and how it would be monitored by the United States, Mr. Zelensky told Bloomberg last week. They did not appear to address the bigger sticking points related to territorial issues and security guarantees — which analysts said may explain why the talks were described as constructive . Mr. Zelensky told Bloomberg that this week’s negotiations would most likely center on the territorial issue. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, confirmed as much on Monday in a call with reporters, adding that the change in focus had prompted the return of Mr. Medinsky as “the chief negotiator.” Officials from Britain, France, Germany and Italy also took part in Tuesday’s talks, though they were not expected to engage with the Russian delegation, according to a Kyiv-based European diplomat. European countries have largely been sidelined in the peace negotiations, even though the war is unfolding on their continent. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has insisted that the war would not end unless Ukraine cedes the portion of the eastern Donetsk region it still controls — roughly 2,000 square miles of land, about the size of Delaware. Mr. Zelensky has repeatedly said Russia’s territorial demand was a nonstarter. But he has signaled openness to compromise, suggesting a demilitarized zone in Donetsk where both Ukrainian and Russian troops would pull back from an equal portion of territory. Polls in Ukraine also show a growing acceptance of territorial concessions among a war-weary public. Russia has long asserted that its slow but steady advance on the battlefield means Ukraine would be better off agreeing to a deal that includes territorial concessions now, rather than having Kyiv lose land later in bloody fighting. Ukraine, by contrast, has sought to maximize the cost of Russia’s advance by inflicting as many casualties on its troops as possible. Counterattacks over the past week have allowed Ukrainian troops to regain some positions in the east along the Haichul River, which serves as a natural barrier to Russian advances, according to battlefield maps and military analysts. But Ukrainian officials said this month that the Trump administration was ramping up pressure on them to make concessions, in a push to end the war by early summer .

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Prosecutors in Austria said on Monday that they had filed terrorism and other charges against a 21-year-old man they said was a member of a terrorist group that was planning an attack on a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna in 2024. The suspect, who was not publicly identified, professed his allegiance to the Islamic State group online, prosecutors said. The attack was thwarted but worries over safety led to the cancellation of three shows the artist had planned in Austria. The main aim was to attack the concert, according to prosecutors, who also accused the man of downloading instructions from ISIS for a shrapnel bomb “specifically designed” for terror attacks. The suspect was charged with receiving instructions on handling and using the materials, the Vienna Public Prosecutor’s Office said . The man is also accused of having repeatedly tried to buy firearms and a hand grenade, and instructing illegal dealers to import the weapons into Austria. The suspect, who has been in custody since August 2024, faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted, prosecutors said. The initial tip about a threat against Ms. Swift’s concerts came from American intelligence , Austrian officials have said. The shows were part of Ms. Swift’s Eras tour, and had been expected to draw tens of thousands of fans. The threat followed deadly attacks on concert halls. In 2015, an ISIS attack on a Paris concert hall and other sites killed 130 people , and in 2017, an attack on an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, killed at least 22 people . The bomber in the Manchester attack, who died in the assault, had links to ISIS . Prosecutors in Germany last year charged a Syrian teenager living in Germany with helping plot the thwarted Vienna concert attack. In that case, prosecutors accused the teenager, whom they identified only as Mohammad A. in keeping with privacy rules, of helping interpret Arabic-language bomb-building instructions and of translating an oath of allegiance to ISIS for the main suspect in the Austria plot. The teen was about 14 years old when the plot was thwarted, and he was convicted and given an 18-month suspended sentence under juvenile criminal law. Christopher F. Schuetze contributed reporting.

      "content": "The Syrian Army has moved into vast new regions, seeking to erase the largest fissure left from the civil war. They have encountered a land in desperate need and deeply divided after years of fighting. The advance has left ethnic Kurds fearful and wary. It has dashed their dream of autonomy in northeastern Syria. Their lingering defiance may point to challenges ahead. The mood was tense as government forces entered the city of Hasakah in northeastern Syria this month. U.S.-led coalition warplanes flew overhead, and a Syrian Army unit monitored the column’s progress from drones, watching for ambush by Kurdish groups. It was the first time the government was moving into Hasakah, a stronghold of the Kurds for more than a decade, and its presence was not welcomed by all. Kurdish soldiers, who are being made to abandon their ambition for an autonomous region, remained defiant, parading with Kurdish flags and weapons before a government base. The display indicated the challenges ahead for President Ahmed al-Sharaa. Benefiting from a switch in American support away from the Kurds, he has used a mixture of muscle and negotiation in recent weeks to take over three provinces of eastern Syria. The vast, resource-rich region had eluded his grasp since his rebel force toppled the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad just over a year ago. His new government is now extending its authority, advancing toward its goal of unifying Syria for the first time in 15 years. The task before him is daunting. Already stretched with stabilizing the war-battered country and lifting its people out of poverty, the government now has a huge new area of territory to secure and rebuild.

During a two-week long journey across the newly opened territory, our reporting team encountered a land in desperate need and deeply divided after years of civil conflict. The Kurds, a minority in Syria, are the dominant population in parts of northeast Syria, and they were by turns wary, resistant and resigned at the prospect of rule from Damascus. Arab residents, who had chafed under the rule of the Kurdish-led force, the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., were celebratory. Some had rushed back to reclaim their homes, even as army units were clearing mines and booby traps left by departing Kurdish forces. “The entire village was displaced in 2013,” said Ahmed al-Ahmad, 40, who had returned from Lebanon and was repairing his house in the village of Al Belasha, in the newly controlled areas of Aleppo province. “Not even a bird could fly here.” The infrastructure demands are immense. The area’s hydroelectric dams, oil fields and rich farming land are debilitated. Much of the countryside lies in darkness. Cities are strewed with trash. Power is so intermittent that neighborhoods roar with the sound of generators. In the provincial capital of Raqqa, cars bumped through potholes filled with muddy rainwater.

Security forces were still searching underground tunnels for explosives and S.D.F. stragglers, said Ahmed Adel, the acting head of the government’s Internal Security forces in Raqqa. “Once we have security,” Mr. Adel said, “we can sort out everything else.” Government officials said they have learned from the experience of taking over the rest of the country after the fall of the Assad regime in December 2024.

Government delegations have been arriving from Damascus to assess the region’s needs, but residents are already complaining about rising gas prices. With the departure of the S.D.F., thousands who had built an economy linked to the force and its administration were now without jobs. In northeastern Syria, the S.D.F. was more than a fighting force but a veritable government of its own. It had been the main ally working with U.S. forces in the area for more than a decade in combating the terrorist group Islamic State and guarding thousands of ISIS prisoners. The Kurds had long wanted their own autonomous region there. But in recent weeks, the Trump administration withdrew its support from the Kurds and threw it behind Mr. al-Sharaa in his aim to unite Syria under his rule. Some Kurds saw the shift as a betrayal. Without American backing, the Kurdish force could not hold their neighborhoods in the city of Aleppo, and had little hope of controlling the mainly Arab populated provinces of Raqqa and Deir al Zour. Some Kurdish fighters in Aleppo chose to make a last stand. After days of fighting, the bulk of the fighters and their political leaders withdrew to Hasakah, a largely Kurdish region. The government has now entered there, too. Image Mines collected from recently captured territory, near the Tishreen Dam.

Image Billboards honoring Kurdish fighters killed during the battle for the Sheikh Maqsoud neighborhood in Aleppo and leaders of the Kurdish struggle across the region. People living in the mainly Arab populated provinces wrested from the S.D.F. complained that the Kurdish-led force had run a harsh police state. “We were always in fear they would raid our shop. We knew anyone could charge us with being an ISIS fighter,” said Belal Bargash, 32, standing outside his cellphone shop in a part of Deir al Zour province that had been controlled by the Kurdish-led force. “We feel extremely relieved,” he said, breaking into a beaming smile. Some Kurds in the region said that they, too, had felt oppressed by the S.D.F.’s administration. Ayman Lolak, 43, a Kurdish businessman in the Sheikh Maqsoud neighborhood of Aleppo, which the S.D.F. had lost, said he was pleased finally to be reconnected to the rest of the city and to the central government. He said the Kurdish administration had confiscated his line of shops and other properties near the front line and allowed him only the use of one shop and one house. “We were under a blockade for the last year,” he said. “Now it’s open and we can import and export goods.” Image Local residents on the formerly S.D.F.-controlled side of the Euphrates River, opposite Deir al Zour.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Just about everyone close to Tshephiso Marumo condemned her when she chose to sell ears of corn door-to-door a decade ago after earning an honors degree from a university in her native Botswana. It was the sort of thing that people in the southern African nation looked down upon as poor people’s work, not something for a sophisticated graduate with dreams of becoming a journalist. One of her former professors was so dismayed that he derisively nicknamed her Mmammidi, a Setswana term that roughly translates to Corn Lady. Ms. Marumo, 33, shrugged off the criticism and has since turned that humble beginning into what many people in Botswana call a tale of triumph and inspiration: She has opened two roadside food stalls in the capital, Gaborone, that have become a hit, selling traditional village cooking that you almost never find in urban areas. Her venture has turned the unglamorous work of roadside food vending into something fashionable, earning her a large social media following and prominent customers, including politicians, musicians and influencers. Video Food being prepared in Ms. Marumo’s backyard. Yet the same qualities that have aided Ms. Marumo’s rise — persistence, candor and stubbornness — have also made her a divisive figure. The more prominent she has become, the louder she has spoken out online about hot-button issues, like parenting and drug addiction, earning her a reputation among some as a social media bully. On Facebook , one of Botswana’s primary social media platforms, Ms. Marumo has more than 240,000 followers, the equivalent of nearly 10 percent of Botswana’s population. She called the business Mmammidi, after the former professor’s nickname, and plastered it onto T-shirts, aprons and two company cars. “There are so many things I have done, but they have never given me a brand or a name or an identity,” she said. “But through the corn, I got an identity.” Ms. Marumo likes to say she sparked controversy even before she was born. Her mother became pregnant with her as a teenager, upsetting many family members. Growing up, Ms. Marumo bounced between Gaborone, where her mother worked as a police officer, and Kalamare, a village three hours away where she stayed with her grandmother. Her grandmother ran an illegal tavern out of their home, something that was frowned upon in the community. But Ms. Marumo said she had no shame in the family business because she was always well taken care of. Her grandmother taught her how to cook, and that interest grew when she took home economics in school. Image Ms. Marumo makes traditional food, including a shredded beef dish known as seswaa and bogobe jwa lerotse, a thick porridge of sorghum and melon juice. Ms. Marumo started her cooking business after building a following with her corn sales. She began hosting dinners at her home, cooking Tswana food in the traditional style — in three-legged cast iron pots over a wood-fired flame. The dishes are seasoned mostly with just salt and natural fats, a traditional technique meant to bring out the true flavors of the meats, starches and vegetables. Her dinners became so popular, she said, that in late 2019 she cleared out a bushy field at a busy intersection near her home and set up her first food stall. Offering village cooking on a street corner near Gaborone’s central business district, Ms. Marumo’s enterprise was a welcome departure for many locals from the usual fare of westernized food showered in spices served up by chain restaurants. “I’m passionate about my heritage, where I’m from and what my ancestors consumed before me,” a satisfied Orebotse Makgolo, 37, said after eating at Ms. Marumo’s stall for the first time recently. “Unfortunately, we consume a lot of western food, and it’s always nice to be in touch with the local side of yourself.” In January, Ms. Marumo opened a second food stall. Both are unfussy stands made of wood with flat, tin-sheet roofs sitting on dirt lots. She now employs 11 workers. They come to her modest bungalow every morning at 6, where they fire up about 30 pots under a shelter in the backyard, cooking the day’s menu in a swirl of heat and eye-burning smoke. The result on a recent day was a spread that included a shredded beef dish known as seswaa , a similar version mixed with tripe called mokoto and bogobe jwa lerotse , a thick porridge of sorghum and melon juice. Image Ms. Marumo’s dinners became so popular that in late 2019, she cleared out a bushy field at a busy intersection near her home and set up her first food stall. Two years ago, Ms. Marumo ventured into a new enterprise, holding the first of what she said would be annual women’s empowerment seminars. But given her reputation as an online bully, many are unconvinced that Ms. Marumo is a true champion of women. On social media, she has criticized how some mothers raise their children and questioned the wisdom of some people’s decision to have children in the first place. Online commenters have, in turn, attacked Ms. Marumo with negative comments about her body. They have criticized her food as “soily,” meaning it tastes like dirt. Thato San, a Botswana native who owns a beauty brand, said she was shocked last year when Ms. Marumo suggested online that Ms. San may have been complicit in the drug addiction of one of her friends, a rapper who had recently died. Just months earlier, Ms. San said, she had nominated Ms. Marumo for special recognition at a Women’s Month brunch. “It was disappointing because I looked up to her,” she said. “Her presence on social media, a lot of people would say is very, very negative.” Ms. Marumo argues that she is misunderstood and that her words are often twisted. Her success, she said, had bred contempt and made people feel that they could say anything about her. She feels compelled to speak about women’s issues because of her own experience overcoming doubters, she said. Mothers often contact her for help with their children, and she has volunteered with and raised funds for an orphanage — experiences that Ms. Marumo said have given her a motherly instinct, even though she does not have children of her own. “I am known by many people, but I’m still human,” she said. “I want my freedom. I need my freedom of expression.” Image Enjoying lunch hour at one of the stalls. Ms. Marumo started her cooking business after building a following with her corn sales. Since college, Ms. Marumo has always done things her way, said Benah Sekgabo, who met her in 2011 when they studied together. Ms. Marumo had a unique hairstyle and would design her own shoes, earrings and clothes, saying that she couldn’t buy the same off-the-rack items as her classmates. The social media controversies don’t seem to have hurt business, so far. For some, Ms. Marumo’s brashness is part of her appeal. “She’s a very confident person,” said Losika Mooketsi, a 20-year-old accounting student as she tucked into a plate of Ms. Marumo’s stewed meat. “She doesn’t let anyone bring her down. People can start rumors about her, and she won’t let that faze her.” Behind the steely exterior, though, Ms. Marumo said the withering criticism can be painful. She starts each day reading the Bible and writing motivational messages on sticky notes, which now form a colorful collage on her bedroom door. “Pray for those who have caused me pain,” reads one note. “Thank you God for P1,000,000,” says another, a reference to her goal of earning at least a million Pula (about $76,000), which she said she was still working toward. And then there’s one from a popular Psalm that might sum up her approach to life: “I will fear no evil.” Image Ms. Marumo. “I am known by many people, but I’m still human,” she said. “I want my freedom.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT An architect of Virginia’s aggressive redistricting scheme will announce on Wednesday that he intends to run for one of the newly drawn Democratic seats himself. Dan Helmer, a four-term state delegate who played a key behind-the-scenes role in last October’s surprise move to redraw Virginia’s congressional maps , is entering the race for the lobster-shaped Seventh Congressional District that will be created if voters approve a constitutional amendment to allow for mid-decade redistricting. A top ally to Don Scott, the Virginia House speaker, Mr. Helmer served as campaigns chairman for the Virginia House Democratic Caucus as the party took control of the chamber in 2023 and then flipped 13 more Republican-held seats last November. Last fall, Mr. Helmer helped devise and implement the redistricting strategy and then marshaled support in Richmond for the first set of votes on the amendment to redraw congressional maps. He later recused himself from the map-drawing process. “We need fighters with a proven track record of not just standing up but winning against Donald Trump and the Republican Congress to get our country back in the right direction,” Mr. Helmer said in an interview. “I’m a progressive fighter with an unmatched record of taking on Trump and winning.” The Seventh is one of four new districts likely to favor Democrats that would be created if Virginia voters pass the redistricting amendment on April 21. It begins at the Potomac River in Arlington and stretches west to the West Virginia border in one lobster claw and south past Richmond to rural Powhatan County, in the other. Vice President Kamala Harris won 54 percent of the vote there in 2024, and Joseph R. Biden Jr. took 56 percent in 2020. An Army veteran of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Mr. Helmer, 44, entered state politics in 2019 on a platform of gun control and abortion rights. He flipped the last Republican-held state House seat in Fairfax County, a Washington suburb that was then in the final stages of a transition from Republican territory to one that now votes for Democrats by large margins. Mr. Helmer is the second Democrat to enter the race, following J.P. Cooney, a top deputy to Jack Smith , the special prosecutor who twice indicted Mr. Trump. Image J.P. Cooney announced his candidacy last week. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times While Mr. Cooney, a career federal prosecutor, is a relative newcomer to Virginia politics, Mr. Helmer has run for Northern Virginia congressional seats twice before, losing in Democratic primaries in 2018 and 2024 . He has built a political base in Fairfax County and among the state’s power brokers in Richmond. Mr. Helmer enters the race with endorsements from former Gov. Ralph Northam; 43 of Virginia’s 84 other Democratic state legislators; and Representative Eugene Vindman, a Virginia Democrat whose current district covers much of the territory Mr. Helmer seeks to represent. “Dan Helmer delivered the largest Democratic majority in four decades,” Mr. Scott, the Virginia House speaker, said. “He whipped Virginia Republicans — Republicans in D.C. should be trembling in their orthopedic shoes.” Though Mr. Helmer helped to whip votes for the constitutional amendment last fall, he said he was not involved in drawing the proposed new maps, an assertion confirmed by several people involved. Still, there was a widespread belief among Virginia Democrats as the new maps were being debated that a new Democratic seat would be drawn for Mr. Helmer. Mr. Helmer said his primary role in drawing the new maps was leading the party’s campaign committee in the House of Delegates to elect new Democrats to the chamber. “There are 17 Republican-held seats that are now held by Democrats,” Mr. Helmer said. “That has allowed us to put redistricting in front of the people, and I’m convinced they will allow us to enact new maps.” Reid J.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Democrats knew in real time last year that they had bungled their response to President Trump’s address to a joint session of Congress, making themselves a distraction rather than offering a cohesive message of resistance to his policies. Representative Al Green, a liberal septuagenarian from Texas, was ejected from the chamber (and later censured) after disrupting the speech with a cane-waving tirade . The paddles that some Democrats waved with short messages on them — “Save Medicaid,” “Musk Steals” and one that just read “False” — were widely panned as a hokey and incoherent response. It was all out of step with the sober, centrist counter to Mr. Trump that party leaders had wanted to project that night. They’re trying something different on Tuesday, when Mr. Trump is scheduled to deliver the first State of the Union address of his second term. A substantial number of Democrats are planning to boycott the speech and attend an alternative event, a rally called the “People’s State of the Union,” which will take place on the National Mall near the Capitol. The event, which is being coordinated by the left-wing advocacy group MoveOn and MeidasTouch, a progressive media company, will feature Democratic lawmakers speaking with people who have been negatively affected by Mr. Trump’s economic and health care policies, as well as federal workers who lost their jobs and immigrants who have been targeted by the Trump administration. It will be hosted by the liberal political commentators Joy Reid and Katie Phang. “He’s made a mockery of the State of the Union speech and he doesn’t deserve an audience,” Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said of Mr. Trump in an interview, explaining why he planned to attend the rally instead of the speech. “He’s going to tell 40 different lies, call Democrats names; he’s going to paper over his corruption; and I don’t feel like what he’s doing dignifies having Democrats there to cloak the speech in a veneer of respectability.” Mr. Murphy, who also skipped the address last year, added: “These aren’t normal times, and we have to stop doing normal things.” Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, attended Mr. Trump’s speech last year but walked out before the end. (Last year, the president spoke for roughly 100 minutes.) This year, Mr. Van Hollen said, he won’t be going. “We cannot normalize this moment when Trump is marching our country toward fascism,” said Mr. Van Hollen, who will also speak at the rally. “I refuse to be a prop in the chamber as Donald Trump shreds our Constitution and attacks our democracy.” Image Representative Al Green yelled in protest as Mr. Trump addressed Congress last year. Credit... Kenny Holston/The New York Times It is unclear how many Democratic members of Congress will attend the speech. Some have expressed concern that boycotting en masse would leave Mr. Trump with a purely sycophantic audience. But even a sizable boycott would break with a tradition, which most Democrats adhered to even through the first Trump administration, of the opposing party dutifully sitting through a speech they mostly disagree with. Even when they registered their disapproval with acts of protest — like when former Speaker Nancy Pelosi ripped up Mr. Trump’s speech when he was finished delivering it — they mostly showed up. Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and minority leader, has encouraged members to either sit silently through the speech or boycott it altogether, rather than attend and create distractions in the House chamber. Mr. Jeffries on Tuesday said it was his “present intention” to attend. “We’re not going to his house, he’s coming to our house,” he told reporters at a news conference. “Having grown up where I grew up, you never let anyone run you off your block.” (Mr. Jeffries grew up in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn.) Lawmakers who are skipping the speech for the rally so far include Senators Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts and Tina Smith of Minnesota, as well as House Democrats including Representatives Becca Balint of Vermont, Greg Casar of Texas, Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Delia Ramirez of Illinois. Another contingent of lawmakers is expected to walk out of the address while Mr. Trump is speaking and make their way to the competing event. “We know that he is going to use the State of the Union to mislead the American people and lie,” said Sara Haghdoosti, the chief of program at MoveOn Civic Action. “We want to make sure we’re focusing on the impact his horrendous policies have had. We want to shift the focus from Trump’s lies to the stories of people.” Annie Karni is a congressional correspondent for The Times.

Image Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, during a Senate hearing last Thursday. Credit... Eric Lee for The New York Times The White House on Tuesday rejected the latest offer from Democratic lawmakers on proposed new constraints on federal immigration officers, the latest sign that there would not be a quick resolution of the stalemate that has left the Department of Homeland Security without funding since Saturday. A White House official who provided a statement on the condition of anonymity to describe private negotiations said the two parties were still far apart, adding that President Trump’s team remained interested in continuing good-faith talks to resolve the impasse. In response, aides for the Democratic leaders in Congress said that Republicans had largely ignored the guardrails the public was demanding, and urged them to start negotiating in good faith as they said their side had been doing. Both White House officials and Democrats on Capitol Hill have kept largely confidential the specifics of their offers to end the standoff that allowed funding for the agency to lapse as of 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The outlines of the Democratic demands, however, are well known: limits on masked police, an end to random sweeps, new requirements for judicial warrants, putting “sensitive locations” such as churches, schools, hospitals and polling places off limits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement among them. The offer was given to the White House Monday evening but brushed aside by the White House less than 24 hours later. “These are common sense,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said Sunday on CNN about the Democratic proposals. “Police departments across America use them. We have a rogue agency. Why don’t we rein them in? That’s what the American people are asking Republicans.” Democrats have portrayed the earlier White House counteroffer to Democrats, which has not been made public, as “nonserious.” People familiar with the talks have said that the White House has not been responsive to many of the Democratic demands for limits on federal immigration agents, and has pushed for new authority of its own, including increased penalties for those who dox officers. Some Republicans have also said that they want an end to local and state policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, sometimes called sanctuary city policies, in exchange for concessions. “When it comes to masks, I don’t know of another law enforcement agency in the country that has an 8,000-percent increase in threats,” Tom Homan, President Trump’s border czar, said Sunday on CBS News’s “Face the Nation.” “Just yesterday, the director of ICE, his wife was filmed walking to work. His home address has been doxed. His kids have been doxed and filmed.” With Congress on a weeklong recess and lawmakers scattered around the world and the nation, chances for approval of a funding agreement this week remained remote since members would have to return to Washington to pass it and the negotiations were not showing any movement. Democrats made clear they intended to stick to their demands and did not appear to be uneasy about any political backlash for blocking money for the agency that also funds airport security, the Coast Guard and disaster relief. “We need change that is dramatic, that is bold, that is meaningful and that is transformational,” Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the House minority leader, said on CBS. “For instance, judicial warrants should be required before ICE agents can storm private property or rip everyday Americans out of their homes.” Many of the Department of Homeland Security’s workers remain on the job but run the risk of missing a paycheck if the funding fight drags on. Mr. Trump is scheduled to deliver the first formal State of the Union address of his second term before Congress next Tuesday. Without some breakthrough, he will make the speech before Congress with one agency without a congressional appropriation for the year, though ICE has a separate pot of money from an earlier measure that can keep it operating.

Credit Credit... Valentin Flauraud/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Indirect talks between American and Iranian officials in Switzerland ended on Tuesday with an agreement on a “set of guiding principles,” according to Iran’s foreign minister, who said both sides had agreed to exchange drafts on a potential deal. The foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, was as positive as he was vague, providing little clarity on what had been discussed or when the next round of discussions might be held. American officials did not immediately comment publicly on the talks, but one U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations, said the two sides had made progress. The official said the Iranians would provide more detailed proposals in the next two weeks to address some of the gaps between the United States and Iran, but did not provide any specifics. Mr. Araghchi told Iranian state television that the talks, which were held in Geneva and lasted about three hours, had been “more constructive” and had made “good progress” compared with a previous round of negotiations in Oman this month. “We now have a clear path ahead, which in my view is positive,” he said. But Mr. Araghchi said a deal was not imminent, as the Middle East remained on edge over the possibility of an American attack should negotiations collapse. Iran has insisted that the talks be strictly limited to its nuclear program, even as U.S. officials have said they would push to curb the range of Iran’s ballistic missiles and its support of militias across the region. Mr. Araghchi did not address those points in his comments to Iranian state television, saying only that the two sides had reached a “general understanding on a set of guiding principles” to continue discussions and to “move toward drafting the text of a possible agreement.” “This does not mean that we can reach an agreement quickly, but at least the path has begun,” he said. Three Iranian officials familiar with the talks said that Iran had indicated a willingness to suspend nuclear enrichment for three to five years — which would cover the duration of Mr. Trump’s presidency — and then join a regional consortium for civilian grade enrichment. Iran would also dilute its stockpile of uranium on its own soil in the presence of international inspectors. In exchange, Iran has demanded that the United States lift financial and banking sanctions and the embargo on its oil sales. The officials, who asked not to be identified to discuss sensitive negotiations, said Iran was also dangling financial incentives and opportunities for investments and trade with the United States, including in Iran’s oil and energy sectors. The negotiations were hosted at the Omani ambassador’s residence by Oman’s foreign minister, Badr Albusaidi, who mediated the previous round of talks. A spokesman for Iran’s foreign ministry said ahead of the talks that Omani officials would shuttle between the two sides. Mr. Albusaidi said on social media after the talks that they had concluded “with good progress towards identifying common goals and relevant technical issues.” “Together we made serious efforts to define a number of guiding principles for a final deal,” he added.",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday released its final report on the midair collision near Ronald Reagan National Airport last year that killed 67 people, as the House announced plans to vote next week on legislation to address some of the institutional failures that investigators said led to the accident. The 419-page document , which brings the board’s intense scrutiny of the accident to a close, did not contain any bombshell revelations, as the board detailed its findings and recommendations late last month. But its presentation of how missed warnings, institutional failures and human errors serve as a detailed and at times devastating account of the episode, which the safety board’s chairwoman, Jennifer Homendy, has said was “100 percent preventable.” The report’s recommendations also serve as a list of action items for aviation safety advocates, who have been pushing for some of the advised changes since long before the crash. But it will be up to Congress and federal agencies whether to implement any of the recommendations. In Congress, the Senate has passed a bipartisan bill to compel the Federal Aviation Administration to conduct safety reviews of airports, and require planes flying through busy airspace to have advanced location tracking technology. That would address two of the key factors that the N.T.S.B. identified in its findings about what caused an Army Black Hawk helicopter to fly into American Airlines Flight 5342 on the night of Jan. 29, without any of the pilots realizing they were on a collision course until barely more than a second before they crashed. But in the House, Representative Sam Graves of Missouri, the Republican chairman of that chamber’s transportation committee, has resisted pressure to advance the legislation. Justin Harclerode, a spokesman for the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said in a statement on Tuesday that the Republican and Democratic leaders of that panel and the one overseeing armed services were “working expeditiously on a comprehensive bill to address the range of issues identified by the N.T.S.B.’s now complete investigation.” He added that the House would soon move forward with its own legislation. Nonetheless, on Tuesday afternoon, following the release of the N.T.S.B. report, House leaders announced plans to put the legislation passed by the Senate to a vote as soon as Monday, with no changes. Two-thirds of the House will have to support the legislation in order for it to pass. During a hearing last week to review the N.T.S.B.’s findings, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Senate committee overseeing transportation, maintained that the bill would “begin to protect the flying public now, which is why the House should pass it and put it on the president’s desk.” Image Family members of those killed in the accident attended a hearing last week that reviewed the N.T.S.B.’s findings on the crash. Credit... Elizabeth Frantz for The New York Times The F.A.A. and the Army have so far not committed to implementing extensive new recommendations the N.T.S.B. approved late last month. Last year, however, the F.A.A. did heed the N.T.S.B.’s recommendations to redirect helicopter traffic around the airport and drastically limit the number of aircraft allowed to pass through the airspace without broadcasting their location to other planes. It implemented the changes just days after the board requested them. “Since Secretary Duffy took office, he and the F.A.A. have taken decisive steps to correct past failures, strengthen accountability and modernize” the national airspace, the F.A.A. said in a statement, referring to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. “Today, we are acting proactively to mitigate risks before they affect the traveling public.” The Army did not respond to a request for comment. The relationship between the F.A.A. and Army has been strained as the aviation safety agency tries to regulate the movements of military aircraft through busy airspace and the military presses to relax the restrictions. In the last week, those tensions were exacerbated by a standoff in El Paso. The F.A.A. temporarily restricted all flights under 18,000 feet there after U.S. Customs and Border Protection, using a high-energy counter-drone laser on loan from the Pentagon, shot down a metallic balloon. The F.A.A. had not yet approved plans to deploy the technology, permission that is required by law. In its final report, the N.T.S.B. issued eight recommendations to the Army. Most of them were directed at training military aviators about the challenges of flying near Reagan National, the limitations of the equipment on board their aircraft, and the collection and assessment of flight safety data. But the bulk of the N.T.S.B.’s new recommendations — 33 of them — were directed at the F.A.A., which board members faulted for poor airport design at Reagan National, ignoring multiple warnings about the potential for collisions. The board also described a culture within the F.A.A. that caused controllers to become accustomed to overwork that sometimes detracted from their ability to closely monitor flights coming dangerously close to one another. On the night of the accident on Jan. 29, 2025, one controller was handling both airplane and helicopter traffic — a double load that the N.T.S.B. found was unnecessary because the control tower at Reagan National had enough staff on hand to avoid it. The board also determined that the controller gave the helicopter pilots too much latitude to manage their own flight through the congested airspace around Reagan National, and never warned the commercial jet pilots to keep an eye out for the Army Black Hawk headed their way. The board also stressed that mandating the use of more advanced location tracking technology — a recommendation it has made as part of multiple aviation accident investigations — could have given the pilots a chance to avoid hitting each other in the contorted airspace around Reagan National, even without the guidance of a controller.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT By the early afternoon on Tuesday, mourners had left around half a dozen bouquets of flowers and a few balloons outside of the Rev. Jesse Jackson’s Tudor-style house on Constance Avenue in the South Shore neighborhood. Next door, Junelle Speller said she had bought her home because she fell in love with the house, but living beside Mr. Jackson was a wonderful bonus. “It was always surreal for us to be living next door to a civil rights icon, someone my husband and I both studied in school here in Chicago,” Mrs. Speller said. Despite Mr. Jackson’s larger-than-life persona and soaring oratory skills, Mrs. Speller soon discovered that in person the civil rights leader “was very grounded, very down to earth, approachable, personable and vibrant.” “He had a deliberate but very inspirational way of speaking,” she said. “You’d be kind of awestruck. But he was at your level, meeting you and sharing those stories, providing motivation for this period of time, for the African American community.” Anita O’Neal, 67, stopped by the Jackson home and showed reporters gathered outside the house a wrinkled photo of herself from 1968. She was 11 years old in the picture, wearing a prim, white outfit for a flight from Chicago to Cape Girardeau, Mo. Sitting in a seat and looking up at her is a young Mr. Jackson, who at the time was a protégé of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Ms. O’Neal said she had come to appreciate the experience only later on in life. “I read about who he was and understood who he was. It was quite an honor for me,” she said. Image Anita O’Neal shows a photo of herself with Jesse Jackson when she was 11 years old. Credit... Nam Y. Huh/Associated Press Ms. O’Neal recalled Mr. Jackson’s quieter side. When he would attend services at St. Sabina Church in the Auburn Gresham neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side, he wouldn’t draw attention to himself, she said. “He wouldn’t come with fanfare,” she said. “He would just walk in, walk down the center aisle, and just go on and sit down.” The pastor, Michael L. Pfleger, would introduce him, she recalled, but Mr. Jackson “didn’t want any recognition. He was there for service.” Joy Jones, 66, said she had come straight to Mr. Jackson’s house after working an overnight shift at a hospital in the Bronzeville neighborhood on the city’s South Side. Still dressed in her purple scrubs, Ms. Jones said she hoped someone would follow in Mr. Jackson’s footsteps just as Mr. Jackson picked up Mr. King’s fight for civil rights after his assassination. “I’m praying that someone will stand up and will continue the movement forward,” Ms. Jones said. “Because it seems this administration is trying to make us take some steps backward, but I really hope that someone — male, female, someone — will stand up and say, ‘We’ve got to keep moving. We’ve got to keep going.’” Among the other Chicagoans who dropped by to pay their respects was Delores Brown, who set down a bouquet of flowers next to the small shrine that had been growing on the Jackson family’s front lawn. He had been a role model, she said, for people in the South Side community where she lived, especially for young Black men. “He’s also been a person that has spoken for us on so many levels when we were not able to speak for ourselves,” she said.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The Rev. Jesse Jackson’s death comes at a moment when Black voters are hugely influential within the Democratic Party and there are more Black senators than ever before — yet the future of Black representation in the House of Representatives is uncertain. The Supreme Court is set to rule in the coming months on a case that will determine the fate of a key provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the federal law that undergirds Southern Black representation in the House. In arguments last fall, the conservative-leaning court seemed skeptical of a key provision of the law, a signature achievement of the civil rights era. Black voters overwhelmingly support the Democratic Party, despite President Trump’s notable gains with them in 2024, and some Democrats and Black faith leaders argue that the country is going backward on civil rights. “We are witnessing right now in real time the kind of attack on voting rights that really does harken back to the darkest days of the civil rights struggle,” Senator Raphael Warnock, a Georgia Democrat and the pastor of the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, said on Tuesday. “I owe it to Rev. Jackson, and we owe it to the next generation, to pass voting rights and ensure that we level the playing field so that every voice can be heard in our democracy.” Some conservatives say that decades of rising political power for Black Americans mean that old legal and policy interventions like the Voting Rights Act are no longer necessary. During oral arguments in the case in October, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said that “this court’s cases, in a variety of contexts, have said that race-based remedies are permissible for a period of time — sometimes for a long period of time, decades in some cases — but that they should not be indefinite, and should have an end point.” Image President Lyndon B. Johnson signing the Voting Rights Act in 1965 as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., center, looked on. Credit... Yoichi Okamoto/LBJ Presidential Library Some Black Republicans, however, have voiced support for the civil rights legislation. “I think the Voting Rights Act is very important — it’s an important part of our history,” Ben Carson, a housing secretary in the first Trump administration, said in an interview. “We should unite around that fact and not let ourselves be divided.” Mr. Carson, who said that he had met Mr. Jackson while still a surgeon and that the civil rights leader had been an early supporter of his books, added: “What’s necessary is that Americans have their voting rights protected, all Americans.” For Democrats, defending the voting rights of Black Americans is also about politics. The influence of Black voters in Democratic presidential primary contests is undeniable: In 2008, 2016 and 2020, Southern states where the primary electorates are dominated by Black voters swung heavily toward the party’s eventual nominees. In those primary races, Black voters in South Carolina and then across the South helped lift Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Joseph R.

Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times In each case, Black voters were pragmatic, said Jaime Harrison, a former chairman of both the Democratic National Committee and the South Carolina Democratic Party, choosing a candidate they believed had the best chance of winning the general election. And now, before the order of states has been set for the 2028 primary contest, a parade of would-be White House hopefuls have made their way to South Carolina. Govs. Gavin Newsom of California and Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, Representative Ro Khanna of California and others have visited the state in recent months with an apparent eye on ingratiating themselves with its largely Black primary electorate. “You’ve seen it election cycle after election cycle,” Mr. Harrison said. “The Black vote has been determinative in the presidential primary. As the first domino falls in South Carolina, it falls the same way across the rest of the South.” Of the 11 Black people ever elected to the Senate , five are serving now: Mr. Booker, Mr. Warnock and Senators Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland and Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, both Democrats. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina is the lone Black Republican senator. Clockwise from top left: Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, Senator Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Senator Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland. The New York Times Ms. Alsobrooks said in an interview on Tuesday that there was “responsibility and pride” in knowing that she is part of the largest group of Black senators to ever serve together. She said the impact went beyond policies debated on the Senate floor. She recalled a day last summer when she arrived after having had her hair braided. “I went to walk onto the Senate floor, when one of the U.S. Capitol Police officers stopped me, and he was thrilled,” she said. “He said, ‘Can I please take a photo with you?’” She added, “He had been in that building for many years and said, ‘Do you know you’re the first person to have ever stepped on the floor of the United States Senate with your hair in braids?’” The provision before the Supreme Court, Section 2, prohibits election or voting practices that discriminate on the basis of race. That guidance has led to the creation of majority-minority districts that are meant to help voters of color elect candidates of their choice. If the court fully struck down the provision, Democrats could lose about a dozen majority-minority districts across the South, according to an analysis by The New York Times . Many of those seats are currently held by Black lawmakers. Even before the Supreme Court ruling arrives, several Republican-led states have already eliminated districts with Black House representatives during the nation’s current gerrymandering battle. In Texas, Representative Marc Veasey, a Democrat, announced he would not run for re-election after he was drawn out of his seat. Representative Al Green, another Democrat, was drawn out of his longtime district and will now run for a different seat in a March primary race . In North Carolina, Representative Don Davis will have a much more difficult re-election fight after the state redrew its maps in October . And in Missouri, a new map threatens the re-election chances of Representative Emanuel Cleaver, a Democrat who has spent 20 years in Congress and was the first Black mayor of Kansas City. This century, the Supreme Court has chipped away at the Voting Rights Act. In 2013, the court struck down another key provision , Section 5, which required states with a history of racial discrimination at the polls to obtain federal approval before changing voting laws. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote in the opinion that “things have changed dramatically” since the law’s adoption decades ago. During oral arguments on the current Voting Rights Act case, Hashim M. Mooppan, a principal deputy solicitor general in the Trump administration, said that many Black members of Congress now hailed from districts that were not majority-minority. “None of these positions is going to lead to there being no Black representation in Congress or anything remotely approaching that,” he said. But civil rights leaders contend that the legal erosion of the Voting Rights Act will hurt Black Americans’ political power. “So here we are, Jesse Jackson dies today, and we have less voting rights protection under the Voting Rights Act than we had on Aug. 6, 1965,” said Bishop William Barber II, a civil-rights leader.

      "content": "Pinned Claire Moses Here’s more on his life. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, America’s most influential Black figure in the years between the civil rights crusades of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the election of Barack Obama, died on Tuesday . He was 84. In a statement, his family said that Mr. Jackson “died peacefully,” but did not give a cause. Mr. Jackson, who was celebrated for his impassioned oratory and populist vision of a “rainbow coalition” of the poor and forgotten, picked up the mantle of Dr. King after his assassination in 1968. He ran for president twice , but he never achieved either the commanding moral stature of Dr. King or the ultimate political triumph attained by Mr. Obama. Tributes flowed in for Mr. Jackson , including from President Trump, who called him “a good man” and a “force of nature,” and former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who described him as “a man of God and of the people.” The Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader, described Mr. Jackson as his mentor. “He was a consequential and transformative leader who changed this nation and the world,” Mr. Sharpton said in a statement.

Credit... Kamil Krzaczynski/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images By the early afternoon on Tuesday, mourners had left around half a dozen bouquets of flowers and a few balloons outside of the Rev. Jesse Jackson’s Tudor-style house on Constance Avenue in the South Shore neighborhood. Next door, Junelle Speller said she had bought her home because she fell in love with the house, but living beside Mr. Jackson was a wonderful bonus. “It was always surreal for us to be living next door to a civil rights icon, someone my husband and I both studied in school here in Chicago,” Mrs. Speller said. Despite Mr. Jackson’s larger-than-life persona and soaring oratory skills, Mrs. Speller soon discovered that in person the civil rights leader “was very grounded, very down to earth, approachable, personable and vibrant.” “He had a deliberate but very inspirational way of speaking,” she said. “You’d be kind of awestruck. But he was at your level, meeting you and sharing those stories, providing motivation for this period of time, for the African American community.” Anita O’Neal, 67, stopped by the Jackson home and showed reporters gathered outside the house a wrinkled photo of herself from 1968. She was 11 years old in the picture, wearing a prim, white outfit for a flight from Chicago to Cape Girardeau, Mo. Sitting in a seat and looking up at her is a young Mr. Jackson, who at the time was a protégé of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Ms. O’Neal said she had come to appreciate the experience only later on in life. “I read about who he was and understood who he was. It was quite an honor for me,” she said. Image Anita O’Neal shows a photo of herself with Jesse Jackson when she was 11 years old. Credit... Nam Y. Huh/Associated Press Ms. O’Neal recalled Mr. Jackson’s quieter side. When he would attend services at St. Sabina Church in the Auburn Gresham neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side, he wouldn’t draw attention to himself, she said. “He wouldn’t come with fanfare,” she said. “He would just walk in, walk down the center aisle, and just go on and sit down.” The pastor, Michael L. Pfleger, would introduce him, she recalled, but Mr. Jackson “didn’t want any recognition. He was there for service.” Joy Jones, 66, said she had come straight to Mr. Jackson’s house after working an overnight shift at a hospital in the Bronzeville neighborhood on the city’s South Side. Still dressed in her purple scrubs, Ms. Jones said she hoped someone would follow in Mr. Jackson’s footsteps just as Mr. Jackson picked up Mr. King’s fight for civil rights after his assassination. “I’m praying that someone will stand up and will continue the movement forward,” Ms. Jones said. “Because it seems this administration is trying to make us take some steps backward, but I really hope that someone — male, female, someone — will stand up and say, ‘We’ve got to keep moving. We’ve got to keep going.’” Among the other Chicagoans who dropped by to pay their respects was Delores Brown, who set down a bouquet of flowers next to the small shrine that had been growing on the Jackson family’s front lawn. He had been a role model, she said, for people in the South Side community where she lived, especially for young Black men. “He’s also been a person that has spoken for us on so many levels when we were not able to speak for ourselves,” she said.

Image Theresa Jackson, left, and her fiancé, Hoyt Zanders, paid their respects to Jesse Jackson outside the Lorraine Motel in Memphis on Tuesday. Credit... Brad J. Vest for The New York Times The museum at the Lorraine Motel was closed, typical for a Tuesday. Yet on a cloudy Memphis day, with a cold wind whipping the flags lowered to half-staff, there were still a few people who came to pay their respects outside. On this day, it was not just about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whose assassination on a balcony at the motel on April 4, 1968, defined the city in American history. For at least a couple of visitors, it was a chance to mourn the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who died at 84 on Tuesday and was among the people who witnessed the murder and sought to carry on Dr. King’s civil rights legacy. “I had to be there,” said Theresa Jackson, 56, who had pulled over Tuesday morning, on her way back to Illinois from Biloxi, Miss. Visiting the motel, which is now home to the National Civil Rights Museum , “gave me chills, just the presence of being there.” Across the South, leaders mourned the death of Mr. Jackson, who was born in South Carolina and crisscrossed the region campaigning for civil rights, championing voter registration and making two unsuccessful bids for the presidency. But in Memphis, where Mr. Jackson returned again and again to the site of Dr. King’s assassination, there was a unique grief over the loss of an elder who had inspired the city’s next generation of Black leaders. “He was a fixture,” Mayor Paul Young said in an interview on Tuesday, recounting how as a young student, he voted for Mr. Jackson in a mock presidential election because “he was somebody I could see myself in, that looked like me.” He met Mr. Jackson at the 2024 Democratic National Convention, Mr. Young recalled, and they had a conversation that was both “personal and meaningful.” “I get to serve as mayor today,” Mr. Young said, “tied to the ground that he broke.” Mr. Jackson embodied the connection between Chicago, where he lived, and Memphis, a familiar stop for many Black Americans traveling north. “He almost was sort of like a son of Memphis in many ways,” said State Representative Justin Pearson, who represents Memphis in the Tennessee General Assembly and received a phone call from Mr. Jackson in 2023 after Mr. Pearson’s colleagues had expelled him from the chamber over a gun control protest. “His connection to our city is obviously deeply rooted in sort of the grief of that loss of Dr. King, but also in this desire and willingness to see our city thrive, to become a better place,” Mr. Pearson added. Mr. Jackson built a partnership with Stax Records , a prominent Memphis institution , spreading his message as a signed, spoken-word recording artist. He spoke at churches and schools, stopped at the occasional barbecue j",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Long before the Rev. Jesse Jackson cemented his legacy as a civil-rights leader in struggles across the country and the world, he was a young boy growing up in Greenville, S.C., in an extremely segregated and poor part of the South that would shape his understanding of race in America. It was a place that Mr. Jackson often invoked in speeches. At the 1988 Democratic National Convention in Atlanta, he described how he was born “in a three-room house, bathroom in the backyard, slop jar by the bed, no hot and cold running water.” He was “born in the slum,” he told the audience, “but the slum was not born in me.” On Tuesday, residents in Greenville reflected on those humble beginnings as they learned of Mr. Jackson’s death at the age of 84 . “He is our son,” said Davida Mathis, a lawyer and activist whose father coached Mr. Jackson in football at Sterling High School. “He was our superstar.” As he grew older, Mr. Jackson turned into a studious, strong and extremely confident “super boy,” neighbors said, someone who ignored coaches’ drawn-up plays as quarterback, who ran errands for neighbors on his bike, and who wrote in yearbooks that he would one day be president — never mind that in the 1950s, it was illegal for him to even sit in the front of a bus. Greenville was also the place that kick-started his involvement in civil rights. In the summer of 1960, when Mr. Jackson was not yet 20 years old, he helped lead a march with seven other Black students at the Greenville public library that had denied him access. And in 2002, when he learned that Greenville County did not acknowledge Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a paid holiday, he flew there every few weeks to petition the local government to begin honoring it. When that didn’t work, he helped organize a march. And after that, he and his allies backed Republican primary candidates who promised to vote for the holiday. Those candidates won, and the county now closes for business on that day. “He’s one of ours who’s done good, and I think that gets overlooked, especially in conversations about the South and activism,” said Avery Allen, a Greenville native who knew Mr. Jackson her entire life. Ken Gibson, a member of the Greenville City Council who knew Mr. Jackson well, described him on Tuesday as “a phenomenal individual.” “He had the most fantastic presence, and he just filled a room,” said Mr. Gibson, whose parents were civil-rights activists with the N.A.A.C.P. in the early 1960s. Still, residents say that Greenville’s celebration of Mr. Jackson feels more muted than in other cities in the South that have birthed titans of the Civil Rights era. In Birmingham, Ala., for example, the city’s airport is named after Fred Shuttlesworth, a Black leader who survived beatings and bombings. At North Carolina A&T University — which Mr. Jackson attended — there is a monument dedicated to the four students who sat down at the segregated lunch counter of the Woolworth’s store. Image Mr. Jackson’s childhood home on Haynie Street, in Greenville. A push to preserve the home as a historic site fizzled after the councilwoman who led the effort died in 2016. Credit... Nick Madigan But in Greenville, S.C., there is no major street, historical marker or monument dedicated to Mr. Jackson, residents noted. Several years ago, there was an effort to preserve his childhood home on Haynie Street as a historical site. But the project fizzled after the councilwoman who led the effort died in 2016. “The fact that Jesse Jackson brings recognition to Greenville and to South Carolina, you would think that they would take advantage of that legacy to use it for tourism,” said Abel A. Bartley, a professor of African American and civil rights history at Clemson University. “The things he did to move our country and our nation forward on civil rights deserves some kind of recognition. And his hometown in particular should lead the way.” Some in Greenville were more interested on Tuesday in reminiscing about quieter, more intimate memories. They remembered Mr. Jackson’s trips back home when he was already an established political figure, how he would ask to go to S & S Cafeteria on Pleasantburg Drive to order his favorite banana cream pie. And they recalled the rhyme and riddle game he would play with his mother, Helen Burns, even in the months before her death in 2015. He would stand by her bedside at the hospital, say a random phrase like “big son went down to the river,” and she would respond with a sentence that rhymed and matched thematically. Freddie Jean Clinkscales, 84, who went to high school with Mr. Jackson, looked up at the house on Haynie Street on Tuesday. She thought of the young man who “was always trying to help everybody,” she said, and who decades later fought to make sure she could sit wherever she wanted to. It had felt so belittling in her youth to step onto an empty bus and be forced to hold herself steady with a pole in the back. If it had not been for people like Mr. Jackson, she said, “we’d still be hanging onto that pole.” Eduardo Medina is a Times reporter covering the South.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Over the past year, the Trump administration has engaged in unconventional diplomacy, gunboat diplomacy and, in the most sensitive crises, diplomacy without diplomats. On Tuesday, the administration tried all three tactics at once. In Geneva, President Trump’s most trusted envoys — his real estate friend Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner — engaged the Iranians in the morning, then the Russians and the Ukrainians in the afternoon. It was a stark example of Mr. Trump’s conviction that the State Department and the National Security Council, the two institutions that have coordinated negotiations over global crises for nearly 80 years, are best left on the sidelines. And so, the Witkoff-Kushner duo has been at the center of recent efforts to end a nuclear crisis in Iran that has stretched over two decades, and a war in Ukraine that is days away from entering its fifth year. By all accounts, Mr. Trump has confidence in their approach, reinforced by their negotiations last year to win a cease-fire in Gaza and the return of all Israeli hostages held by Hamas. And countries like Russia, Turkey and the Gulf Arab states have welcomed the arrival of the two men, with their transactional approach born of New York property negotiations, especially given the greater flexibility offered by Mr. Witkoff and Mr. Kushner. They talk the language of deal makers, and do not spend much time lecturing on human rights or democracy building. And not infrequently, their interlocutors on diplomatic issues are closely linked to the business deals that the Trump and Witkoff families are negotiating. “Some countries really welcome this informal structure at the Trump White House,” said Asli Aydintasbas, a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. But, she added, “I have not seen anyone hugely impressed with the diplomatic skills of the current team.” One person close to the Kremlin said that Russian officials appreciated Mr. Witkoff’s warmth and enthusiasm for the negotiations, even as they sometimes doubted his reliability as a messenger. But he was clearly new to the issues dividing Washington and Moscow, and at first brought no other American experts into his negotiations. More recently, the Russians have been happy to have Mr. Kushner’s involvement, the person said, because of his more organized and structured approach. Some Russians have taken to calling the duo “Witkoff and Zyatkoff,” because “zyat” is Russian for son-in-law. The Iranians also have a nickname for Mr. Kushner, using the Persian word for son-in-law: Damad Trump, again defining Mr. Kushner’s influence by virtue of his marriage to the president’s daughter, Ivanka. Iranian media have dedicated coverage and columns to Mr. Kushner’s participation. Ahmad Zeidabadi, a prominent political analyst and columnist, wrote in Asr Iran newspaper that Mr. Kushner’s participation in talks was something “positive.” “He represents the pragmatic and softer side of Trump,” he said. Mr. Kushner, in an interview last October , said that his and Mr. Witkoff’s approach to diplomacy relied on being “deal guys” who “have to understand people.” Mr. Witkoff was known in real estate circles for major transactions, including buying the Woolworth Building, once New York’s tallest skyscraper, in 1998. Mr. Kushner followed his father, the real estate developer Charles Kushner, into the business and later expanded into private equity. Mr. Kushner holds no official government title, and gets no government salary, while Mr. Witkoff is a U.S. “special envoy.” In Mr. Trump’s first term, Mr. Kushner spearheaded the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab countries — though his hopes of bringing Saudi Arabia aboard have not yet come to fruition. Last year, his efforts negotiating the cease-fire in Gaza drew praise even from some Democrats, for pushing closer to ending a war that President Joseph R. Biden Jr. could not. Supporters of the administration see Mr. Witkoff and Mr. Kushner as ideal negotiators in part because their personal wealth, they say, makes them more resistant to corrupting influences. But both men face questions over apparent conflicts of interest. Mr. Witkoff’s son Zach is the chief executive of World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s cryptocurrency company. An investment firm tied to the United Arab Emirates purchased nearly half the company last year for $500 million. Mr. Kushner raised several billion dollars before Mr. Trump’s second term from overseas investors, including government wealth funds in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, countries he had worked with when he served as a senior White House adviser during Mr. Trump’s first term. Yet as they engage with Mr. Witkoff and Mr. Kushner, the Russians and the Iranians share a strategy: delay. At the Munich Security Conference last weekend, several participants on the edges of the negotiations over Ukraine, which Russia invaded four years ago next Tuesday, said repeatedly that Russia had every reason to engage in the negotiations and little compelling reason to sign an agreement. President Vladimir V. Putin believes he is winning, military and intelligence officials from several Western countries said in recent days. And he is convinced that even if it takes 18 months to two years to complete his hold on the Donbas region, each day of fighting and each night of Russian missiles and drones raining down on energy infrastructure and apartment buildings secure him more leverage. For the Iranians, delay is the regime’s last strategy for survival. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was in Slovakia and Hungary early this week but is not participating in either of the Geneva negotiations, made the case for pessimism. “It’s going to be hard,” he told reporters. “It’s been very difficult for anyone to do real deals with Iran, because we’re dealing with radical Shia clerics who are making theological decisions, not geopolitical ones.” But the commonalities end there. In the Iranian case, Mr. Trump is backing up his diplomacy with a threat of fairly imminent military action if there is no progress — maybe in days, perhaps in weeks. In the Russia-Ukraine case, he has slowed down the military pressure, halting the direct provision of arms to Ukraine that took place — with strong congressional support — in the Biden years. The president has also cracked down on the Russian “shadow fleet” selling oil, exacerbating Mr. Putin’s deepening economic troubles, even while the Trump administration floats ideas about U.S. investment in Russia if a deal, almost any deal, can be announced. Given those dynamics, some analysts predicted that Mr. Putin could still make a deal to stop the fighting in Ukraine, especially if he secured a far-reaching rapprochement with the United States and a withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from the rest of the Donbas. The negotiations with Iran are overshadowed by the size of the U.S. naval force — a “great armada” in Mr. Trump’s telling — that is being assembled in the Red Sea, clearly positioned to strike if the president so decides. But the Iranians are hardly de-escalating. They have temporarily closed the Strait of Hormuz because of Iranian live fire exercises, a not-so-gentle reminder of the country’s ability to throw energy markets into chaos. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, did not contribute much to the spirit of finding a nonmilitary solution when he was asked about the presence of one U.S. carrier group and the arrival in a week or so of a second — a huge massing of firepower. “An aircraft carrier is a dangerous machine, but even more dangerous than that is the weapon capable of sending it to the bottom of the sea,” he said as he commemorated the 1978 uprising that toppled the pro-American Shah of Iran. (The Shah’s son, Reza Pahlavi, was in Munich over the weekend, at one of many large protests around the world that echoed his calls for th",

No one was hurt and there was no further threat to the area, the agency said. The episode occurred just after noon, when the armed man got out of a white Mercedes S.U.V. parked on Maryland Avenue and began running toward the Capitol, Chief Michael G. Sullivan of the Capitol Police told reporters. Capitol Police officers confronted the man at the base of a staircase walkway near the West Front of the building, drew their firearms and ordered him to drop his weapon. The man “immediately complied” and lay on the ground, where he was taken into custody, Mr. Sullivan said. The man was wearing a tactical vest and gloves and carrying additional ammunition rounds. A Kevlar helmet and a gas mask were also found in his vehicle, Mr. Sullivan said. Investigators were still working to determine the man’s motive. Capitol Police temporarily closed a section of Maryland Avenue near the Garfield Monument, and the authorities have footage of the man but were asking members of the public who may have taken additional cellphone footage to send it in, Mr. Sullivan said. Capitol Police identified the man as Carter Camacho of Smyrna, Ga., and said in a statement that he was arrested for unlawful activities, carrying a rifle without a license, having an unregistered firearm and having unregistered ammunition. He was not previously known to Capitol Police, and there did not appear to be any other suspects involved, the agency said. Congress was not in session this week, but the episode comes at a time when lawmakers have faced escalating threats. A man attacked Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota during a town hall event in Minneapolis less than a month ago, and lawmakers had already been grappling with intense fears about their personal safety after the assassination of the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk on a college campus. Capitol Police said it had investigated nearly 15,000 “concerning statements, behaviors, and communications directed against members of Congress, their families, staff, and the Capitol complex” in 2025, roughly a 58 percent increase over 2024 . Mr. Sullivan, who commended the officers who responded on Tuesday for their “brave service,” said that Capitol Police had held an active shooter exercise a few months ago “virtually in the same spot” where the man was confronted. “We do those active shooter exercises every single month,” he said, “and that’s why we do it.” Anushka Patil is a Times reporter covering breaking and developing news around the world.

The captain, Avtandil Kalandadze, was charged with two federal crimes, according to the Feb. 12 indictment, which has not previously been reported. The first count accused Mr. Kalandadze of falsely flying the flag of Guyana on the tanker — the ship was not registered in that country — in an attempt to evade being seized by the U.S. Coast Guard on Dec. 20. The second accuses Mr. Kalandadze of failing to obey an order from the Coast Guard to stop the tanker and allow U.S. forces to board it. Instead, the ship, then known as Bella 1, which had been sailing in the Caribbean Sea toward Venezuela, turned back into the Atlantic, chased by U.S. forces. Along the way, the ship changed its name to Marinera and claimed Russian protection. Its crew painted a Russian flag on the tanker’s side, and it was registered in Russia’s official ship database . The Russian government used diplomatic channels to request that the United States stop chasing the tanker. But U.S. forces boarded and seized the ship on Jan. 7, near the United Kingdom, detaining Mr. Kalandadze and the rest of the crew. The seizure of the ship was part of Mr. Trump’s attempt to take control of Venezuela’s multi-billion-dollar oil industry. So far, the United States has boarded eight other vessels involved in the Venezuelan oil trade. The ships are part of a so-called ghost fleet transporting oil from Venezuela, Iran or Russia around the globe in violation of sanctions placed by the United States and other countries. U.S. authorities had obtained a seizure warrant for the Bella 1 based on its history of transporting Iranian oil for groups linked to terrorism. After the ship was seized, Mr. Kalandadze’s wife, Natia Dzadzama, initiated an unsuccessful legal challenge in the United Kingdom, seeking a judicial review of her husband’s detention, according to local media reports. Aamer Anwar, a lawyer for Ms. Dzadzama, said in a statement on Tuesday that “the U.S. has once again shown a total disregard for the rule of law and international obligations with its closest ally, the U.K.” The White House and the Justice Department did not immediately reply to requests for comment. The BBC reported last month that the United States planned to charge another member of the crew but had released the remaining 26 crew members. Note: The International Maritime Organization issues an IMO number, a permanent identification number, that remains associated with a vessel throughout its lifetime unlike a ship’s name, which can change frequently. The ship in this article is 9230880, known as Marinera, or previously as Bella 1.

      "content": "Pinned Claire Moses Here’s more on his life. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, America’s most influential Black figure in the years between the civil rights crusades of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the election of Barack Obama, died on Tuesday . He was 84. In a statement, his family said that Mr. Jackson “died peacefully,” but did not give a cause. Mr. Jackson, who was celebrated for his impassioned oratory and populist vision of a “rainbow coalition” of the poor and forgotten, picked up the mantle of Dr. King after his assassination in 1968. He ran for president twice , but he never achieved either the commanding moral stature of Dr. King or the ultimate political triumph attained by Mr. Obama. Tributes flowed in for Mr. Jackson , including from President Trump, who called him “a good man” and a “force of nature,” and former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who described him as “a man of God and of the people.” The Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader, described Mr. Jackson as his mentor. “He was a consequential and transformative leader who changed this nation and the world,” Mr. Sharpton said in a statement.

Credit... Kamil Krzaczynski/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images By the early afternoon on Tuesday, mourners had left around half a dozen bouquets of flowers and a few balloons outside of the Rev. Jesse Jackson’s Tudor-style house on Constance Avenue in the South Shore neighborhood. Next door, Junelle Speller said she had bought her home because she fell in love with the house, but living beside Mr. Jackson was a wonderful bonus. “It was always surreal for us to be living next door to a civil rights icon, someone my husband and I both studied in school here in Chicago,” Mrs. Speller said. Despite Mr. Jackson’s larger-than-life persona and soaring oratory skills, Mrs. Speller soon discovered that in person the civil rights leader “was very grounded, very down to earth, approachable, personable and vibrant.” “He had a deliberate but very inspirational way of speaking,” she said. “You’d be kind of awestruck. But he was at your level, meeting you and sharing those stories, providing motivation for this period of time, for the African American community.” Anita O’Neal, 67, stopped by the Jackson home and showed reporters gathered outside the house a wrinkled photo of herself from 1968. She was 11 years old in the picture, wearing a prim, white outfit for a flight from Chicago to Cape Girardeau, Mo. Sitting in a seat and looking up at her is a young Mr. Jackson, who at the time was a protégé of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Ms. O’Neal said she had come to appreciate the experience only later on in life. “I read about who he was and understood who he was. It was quite an honor for me,” she said. Image Anita O’Neal shows a photo of herself with Jesse Jackson when she was 11 years old. Credit... Nam Y. Huh/Associated Press Ms. O’Neal recalled Mr. Jackson’s quieter side. When he would attend services at St. Sabina Church in the Auburn Gresham neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side, he wouldn’t draw attention to himself, she said. “He wouldn’t come with fanfare,” she said. “He would just walk in, walk down the center aisle, and just go on and sit down.” The pastor, Michael L. Pfleger, would introduce him, she recalled, but Mr. Jackson “didn’t want any recognition. He was there for service.” Joy Jones, 66, said she had come straight to Mr. Jackson’s house after working an overnight shift at a hospital in the Bronzeville neighborhood on the city’s South Side. Still dressed in her purple scrubs, Ms. Jones said she hoped someone would follow in Mr. Jackson’s footsteps just as Mr. Jackson picked up Mr. King’s fight for civil rights after his assassination. “I’m praying that someone will stand up and will continue the movement forward,” Ms. Jones said. “Because it seems this administration is trying to make us take some steps backward, but I really hope that someone — male, female, someone — will stand up and say, ‘We’ve got to keep moving. We’ve got to keep going.’” Among the other Chicagoans who dropped by to pay their respects was Delores Brown, who set down a bouquet of flowers next to the small shrine that had been growing on the Jackson family’s front lawn. He had been a role model, she said, for people in the South Side community where she lived, especially for young Black men. “He’s also been a person that has spoken for us on so many levels when we were not able to speak for ourselves,” she said.

Vest for The New York Times The museum at the Lorraine Motel was closed, typical for a Tuesday. Yet on a cloudy Memphis day, with a cold wind whipping the flags lowered to half-staff, there were still a few people who came to pay their respects outside. On this day, it was not just about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whose assassination on a balcony at the motel on April 4, 1968, defined the city in American history. For at least a couple of visitors, it was a chance to mourn the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who died at 84 on Tuesday and was among the people who witnessed the murder and sought to carry on Dr. King’s civil rights legacy. “I had to be there,” said Theresa Jackson, 56, who had pulled over Tuesday morning, on her way back to Illinois from Biloxi, Miss. Visiting the motel, which is now home to the National Civil Rights Museum , “gave me chills, just the presence of being there.” Across the South, leaders mourned the death of Mr. Jackson, who was born in South Carolina and crisscrossed the region campaigning for civil rights, championing voter registration and making two unsuccessful bids for the presidency. But in Memphis, where Mr. Jackson returned again and again to the site of Dr. King’s assassination, there was a unique grief over the loss of an elder who had inspired the city’s next generation of Black leaders. “He was a fixture,” Mayor Paul Young said in an interview on Tuesday, recounting how as a young student, he voted for Mr. Jackson in a mock presidential election because “he was somebody I could see myself in, that looked like me.” He met Mr. Jackson at the 2024 Democratic National Convention, Mr. Young recalled, and they had a conversation that was both “personal and meaningful.” “I get to serve as mayor today,” Mr. Young said, “tied to the ground that he broke.” Mr. Jackson embodied the connection between Chicago, where he lived, and Memphis, a familiar stop for many Black Americans traveling north. “He almost was sort of like a son of Memphis in many ways,” said State Representative Justin Pearson, who represents Memphis in the Tennessee General Assembly and received a phone call from Mr. Jackson in 2023 after Mr. Pearson’s colleagues had expelled him from the chamber over a gun control protest. “His connection to our city is obviously deeply rooted in sort of the grief of that loss of Dr. King, but also in this desire and willingness to see our city thrive, to become a better place,” Mr. Pearson added. Mr. Jackson built a partnership with Stax Records , a prominent Memphis institution , spreading his message as a signed, spoken-word recording artist. He spoke at churches and schools, stopped at the occasional barbecue j",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Representative Randy Fine, Republican of Florida, on Tuesday faced a barrage of calls for his resignation from Democrats — and silence from Republican leaders — after making an Islamophobic statement suggesting he prefers dogs to Muslims. Mr. Fine, a Jewish first-term congressman who was known in the Florida Legislature as “The Hebrew Hammer” and often makes Islamophobic remarks on social media, made the statement in question on Sunday in response to a post from a Palestinian activist based in New York City. Nerdeen Kiswani, a Palestinian Muslim New Yorker and organizer, said in a social media post that dung-filled snowdrifts in the city proved that dogs should not have a place in society as indoor pets because, she wrote, “like we’ve said all along, they are unclean.” Mr. Fine responded: “If they force us to choose, the choice between dogs and Muslims is not a difficult one.” The comment prompted immediate and unequivocal condemnation from Democrats. Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said that Mr. Fine “is a disgrace to the United States Congress. He is an Islamophobic, disgusting and unrepentant bigot.” Mr. Jeffries added that it was “unacceptable that Mike Johnson and House Republicans continue to remain silent,” referring to the speaker. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, the reigning Democratic king of trolling Republicans online, wrote bluntly, “Resign now, you racist slob.” Many House Democrats called for Mr. Fine to be stripped of his committee assignments. But Mr. Johnson remained silent, and Mr. Fine doubled down in response to the backlash. “My post was in response to a major Muslim leader saying dogs should be forbidden from New York City because to some Muslims, it bothers them,” Mr. Fine said in an appearance on Newsmax. “If they’re going to make us choose between our dogs and them going home, the choice is easy.” One of the few conservatives who criticized Mr. Fine publicly was Megyn Kelly, the podcast host, who wrote in an online post that “instead of attacking the person or the policy, you went full bigot.” On social media, Ms. Kiswani called Mr. Fine a “rabid Zionist” who used her words “as an excuse to post genocidal rhetoric against Muslims.” In a follow-up email to The New York Times, Ms. Kiswani said that she had intended her words to land as a “mild, satirical” post, and viewed Mr. Fine’s response as reflective of a political climate in which “anti-Palestinian and anti-Muslim bigotry is normalized and hostility toward our communities is more easily justified.” She said her post was misinterpreted and used as “grounds for days of attacks, threats and widespread misinformation, including inaccurate claims that I am part of Mayor Mamdani’s administration.” Mr. Fine has referred to both Muslim women in Congress as “terrorists.” In a post in May, he addressed Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, who had accused the Israeli government of starving Gazans, saying she should “tell your fellow Muslim terrorists to release the hostages and surrender. Until then, #StarveAway.” In July, Mr. Fine called Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, a “terrorist” after she appeared to refer to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel as a war criminal. “I’m sure it is difficult to see us welcome the killer of so many of your fellow Muslim terrorists,” he wrote online, referring to Ms. Omar. “The only shame is that you serve in Congress.” At the time, House Democratic leaders condemned his comment. Mr. Johnson never did. Annie Karni is a congressional correspondent for The Times.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The White House on Tuesday rejected the latest offer from Democratic lawmakers on proposed new constraints on federal immigration officers, the latest sign that there would not be a quick resolution of the stalemate that has left the Department of Homeland Security without funding since Saturday. A White House official who provided a statement on the condition of anonymity to describe private negotiations said the two parties were still far apart, adding that President Trump’s team remained interested in continuing good-faith talks to resolve the impasse. In response, aides for the Democratic leaders in Congress said that Republicans had largely ignored the guardrails the public was demanding, and urged them to start negotiating in good faith as they said their side had been doing. Both White House officials and Democrats on Capitol Hill have kept largely confidential the specifics of their offers to end the standoff that allowed funding for the agency to lapse as of 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The outlines of the Democratic demands, however, are well known: limits on masked police, an end to random sweeps, new requirements for judicial warrants, putting “sensitive locations” such as churches, schools, hospitals and polling places off limits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement among them. The offer was given to the White House Monday evening but brushed aside by the White House less than 24 hours later. “These are common sense,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said Sunday on CNN about the Democratic proposals. “Police departments across America use them. We have a rogue agency. Why don’t we rein them in? That’s what the American people are asking Republicans.” Democrats have portrayed the earlier White House counteroffer to Democrats, which has not been made public, as “nonserious.” People familiar with the talks have said that the White House has not been responsive to many of the Democratic demands for limits on federal immigration agents, and has pushed for new authority of its own, including increased penalties for those who dox officers. Some Republicans have also said that they want an end to local and state policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, sometimes called sanctuary city policies, in exchange for concessions. “When it comes to masks, I don’t know of another law enforcement agency in the country that has an 8,000-percent increase in threats,” Tom Homan, President Trump’s border czar, said Sunday on CBS News’s “Face the Nation.” “Just yesterday, the director of ICE, his wife was filmed walking to work. His home address has been doxed. His kids have been doxed and filmed.” With Congress on a weeklong recess and lawmakers scattered around the world and the nation, chances for approval of a funding agreement this week remained remote since members would have to return to Washington to pass it and the negotiations were not showing any movement. Democrats made clear they intended to stick to their demands and did not appear to be uneasy about any political backlash for blocking money for the agency that also funds airport security, the Coast Guard and disaster relief. “We need change that is dramatic, that is bold, that is meaningful and that is transformational,” Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the House minority leader, said on CBS. “For instance, judicial warrants should be required before ICE agents can storm private property or rip everyday Americans out of their homes.” Many of the Department of Homeland Security’s workers remain on the job but run the risk of missing a paycheck if the funding fight drags on. Mr. Trump is scheduled to deliver the first formal State of the Union address of his second term before Congress next Tuesday. Without some breakthrough, he will make the speech before Congress with one agency without a congressional appropriation for the year, though ICE has a separate pot of money from an earlier measure that can keep it operating.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT For two decades, few corners of global finance were lonelier than the market for Japanese government bonds. Under the Bank of Japan’s longstanding regime of keeping borrowing costs pinned at zero, yields on the securities, known as J.G.B.s, largely flatlined. Over the years, the few contrarian investors willing to bet that yields might eventually rise were burned so badly that the trade was named the “widow-maker.” In the world’s second-largest government bond market, entire days would pass without a single benchmark bond changing hands. Those days are gone. Last month, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s vow to cut taxes sparked anxiety over Tokyo’s ability to service its staggering $9 trillion debt. Yields on the 30-year government bond surged more than a quarter percentage point in a single session, an enormous move in a market where daily changes are typically measured only in hundredths of a point. The volatility was so profound that Scott Bessent, the U.S. Treasury secretary, called his counterparts in Tokyo seeking reassurances to help steady global markets rattled by the moves. Yields, a benchmark for borrowing costs, jumped again last week after Ms. Takaichi’s party won in a landslide election, which investors viewed as a mandate for her high-spending agenda. For the broader Japanese economy, the spike signals a potentially grim slide. If yields continue their ascent, some economists and investors warn that Japan risks falling into a “debt trap” — a vicious cycle in which rising interest costs consume so much of the national budget that the government must borrow even more just to pay the interest. But for J.G.B.s and their veteran traders, the recent movements have generated a return to a level of fervor not seen in decades. After a prolonged professional hibernation, a rare class of traders and strategists — most now in their 60s or older — are finding themselves back in the limelight as global investment firms seek to tap their experience in navigating an environment of actual, moving interest rates. “It’s becoming a ‘battlefield’ again,” said Hiroyuki Kubota, 67, who dealt Japanese government bonds 40 years ago and has since written several books on the securities. “It’s just like the old days.” Image Hiroyuki Kubota, a veteran of the Japanese government bond market going back decades, said the recent fluctuations in yields reminded him of “the old days.” Credit... Kentaro Takahashi for The New York Times Mr. Kubota began dealing the bonds in 1986, just after a series of reforms meaningfully opened Japan’s government debt markets to global investors. At the time, Nomura Securities, the king of Japan’s bubble-era finance, was hosting boozy, dayslong annual cherry blossom seminars in Kyoto to pitch government bonds to overseas central bankers. The market was booming. In the 1980s and 1990s, yields shifted rapidly alongside fluctuations in Japan’s overall economy. Yields on 10-year bonds doubled from 4 percent in 1989 to 8 percent in 1990, before falling back to 5 percent by 1992. Investors rushed to profit from the swings. After J.G.B. futures — contracts to buy or sell bonds at a later date — were introduced in 1985, they quickly became the world’s most heavily traded bond futures. “It was a party,” said Hiromi Yamaji, 70, chief executive of the Japan Exchange Group, recalling the annual Kyoto gatherings of the 1980s. Before assuming his current post at the operator of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Mr. Yamaji spent 36 years at Nomura. J.G.B.s “were a very lucrative product,” he said. “Everybody was trading them a lot.” At the time, traders were being wooed by the likes of Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers, which were expanding their presence in Tokyo. Top-tier strategists could command compensation packages in the millions of dollars as American firms sought to poach talent from traditional Japanese banks. Mr. Kubota, the former J.G.B. dealer, started a website in the late 1990s featuring a chat room that he said had attracted market movers and officials from Japan’s Ministry of Finance. He hosted annual parties on a traditional Japanese houseboat, where the elite of the bond world would talk shop while cruising the Sumida River in central Tokyo. Recent swings in yields “may have been a shock to those who only knew the last 20 years,” Mr. Kubota said. “But to those who know the old days, they aren’t strange at all.” Image In the years since Mr. Kubota started dealing government bonds in the 1980s, he has become one of Japan’s best-known bond watchers and has written several books on the subject. Credit... via Hiroyuki Kubota Paralysis began to set in for Japanese government bonds around the turn of the century. After the bursting of the Japanese asset bubble and the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the Bank of Japan in 1999 became the first major central bank in recent memory to lower interest rates to zero. As the central bank began buying bonds to force rates down, the 10-year yield hit a record low of less than 0.5 percent in 2003. For two decades, as policymakers kept rates near zero to combat persistent deflation, yields hardly budged. In 2016, they fell below zero, meaning investors were basically paying to hold the bonds. “For many, many years, it was a very difficult market,” the Japan Exchange Group’s Mr. Yamaji said. “Nobody had any interest in trading.” With average daily trading volumes tanking, Japan’s local banks, once the most aggressive traders of government bonds, began to close their trading operations. International groups scaled back as well. Many veterans left high-paying foreign firms like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley. They either “semiretired” or were pushed into less glamorous roles, such as research, at domestic firms, said Yoshiki Kumazawa, a director at Morgan McKinley, a recruitment firm in Tokyo. “We call it ‘juniorization,’” said Mr. Kumazawa, who compared it to shipping a baseball player who once starred for the New York Yankees off to a Japanese team. Mr. Yamaji tried to revive the market throughout the 2010s by introducing new trading methods for the bonds, but the stagnation persisted until 2024. That was when a burst of postpandemic inflation led the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates for the first time in 17 years . This prompted a rise in bond yields. Image Hiromi Yamaji, the chief executive of the group that runs the Tokyo Stock Exchange, remembers when trading Japanese government bonds “was a party.” Credit... Kentaro Takahashi for The New York Times Those yields then spiked higher on Jan. 19, when Ms. Takaichi endorsed a tax-suspension measure estimated to cost more than $30 billion annually. The next day, Japan’s 40-year bond yield broke above 4 percent for the first time since 2007. Some see the surge as an alarming sign that Japan will struggle to finance its debt. Kyle Bass, founder of Hayman Capital Management, a Dallas-based hedge fund, was known in the 2010s for his high-conviction bet that Japanese bond yields would eventually skyrocket as the government’s debt load reached a breaking point, a wager widely dismissed as the ultimate “widow-maker.” He acknowledges that the position did not pay off at the time. Now, with yields rising and Japan’s total debt having risen to a record $8.77 trillion last year, his thesis is becoming harder to dismiss. “The question is: How do they hold it all together?” Mr. Bass said. Borrowing costs are rising in a number of the world’s largest economies. Japan, however, “is about 10 years ahead of everyone in its financial position,” he said. “I’m afraid of the situation they’re in.” For others, the commotion is an opportunity. Average daily trading volumes of J.G.B. futures have surged in recent years, and the number of outstanding positions in the market has reached record highs, according to Mr. Yamaji. Global hedge funds have snapped up top local talent, according to Mr. Kumazawa. Mr. Kubota, the former J.G.B. dealer and well-kn",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT In an opinion heavy on chicken puns, a district court judge ruled on Tuesday that the boneless wings at Buffalo Wild Wings could indeed be called wings. The order, in a lawsuit filed by a Chicago man in 2023, was dripping with skepticism at the claims that the chain was misleading consumers about its boneless wings. Judge John J. Tharp Jr., of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, dismissed the claim by Aimen Halim, saying it “has no meat on its bones.” “Despite his best efforts, Halim did not ‘drum’ up enough factual allegations to state a claim,” Judge Tharp said in his ruling. Buffalo Wild Wings did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for Mr. Halim also did not respond to a request for comment. According to the complaint, Mr. Halim bought boneless wings from Buffalo Wild Wings in Mount Prospect, Ill., in January 2023. Mr. Halim thought he was buying chicken wings that had been deboned, but he soon discovered they were not. Mr. Halim sued Buffalo Wild Wings, saying the chain deceives its customers by labeling its products as “boneless wings,” when the chain instead uses breast meat, which is cheaper. According to the judge’s order, Mr. Halim claimed that had he known the product was not actually deboned chicken wings, he would have paid less or not bought it at all. Buffalo Wild Wings disputed Mr. Halim’s claims, saying that context clues make clear the nuggets cannot be made of wing meat, and that “wing” refers to the style of cooking, not a chicken’s body part. In his order, the judge sided with Buffalo Wild Wings, saying a reasonable consumer would not think that boneless wings were made of wing meat. Judge Tharp noted that cauliflower wings are also sold under the wing section of the restaurant’s menu and as an alternative to traditional wings. “If Halim is right, reasonable consumers should think that cauliflower wings are made (at least in part) from wing meat,” he said. “They don’t, though.” Judge Tharp also said that the menu offered boneless wings at a cheaper price than traditional wings — an indication that the item is not, in fact, deboned. Mr. Halim can amend his claim to try to prove he suffered “economic injury,” but it’s unlikely to be persuasive, Judge Tharp said. He has until March 20 to file an amended complaint. This is not the first time that boneless chicken wings have caused legal action and other drama. The Ohio Supreme Court ruled in July 2024 that a man who ordered boneless wings should have expected the possibility of bones, denying him a jury trial after he suffered serious medical complications from a bone fragment. In 2020, a man in Lincoln, Neb., delivered a passionate plea to his City Council to remove the name boneless wings from menus in the city. And on Reddit, there are hundreds of comments debating the legitimacy of “boneless wings” as a true product, with some carefully explaining how they are different from chicken nuggets. Recipes explaining how to make boneless wings call for a variety of ingredients, but typically begin with a boneless chicken breast.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The U.S. government outlined tens of billions of dollars in planned Japanese investments in the United States as part of a trade agreement struck last year, marking the start of a massive pledge that has faced domestic frictions and financing hurdles. In a statement late Tuesday, the U.S. commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said Japan would provide capital for three projects: a natural gas plant in Ohio, a crude oil export facility along the U.S. Gulf Coast and a synthetic diamond manufacturing site in Georgia. The projects represent a $36 billion commitment and are expected to generate thousands of jobs, Mr. Lutnick said. The energy and manufacturing projects are the first phase of funding under a trade framework agreed in July, under which Tokyo pledged $550 billion in funding to U.S.-based projects. In exchange, the Trump administration agreed to impose a 15 percent blanket tariff on Japanese exports — a reprieve from the more aggressive duties it had threatened. For months, U.S. officials have pressured their Japanese counterparts to move forward with concrete investment plans. For members of the Trump administration, especially Mr. Lutnick, the goal was to maintain momentum after President Trump’s visit to Japan in October. For their part, Japanese officials were eager to show progress before Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s scheduled visit to the United States in March. In an election last week, her party won in a landslide , and Mr. Trump congratulated the prime minister, wishing her success in her “conservative, peace-through-strength agenda.” Around the time of Ms. Takaichi’s visit to the United States, Japanese officials are considering making several additional investment announcements, according to two people familiar with the plans. Japan is aiming to stay out of Mr. Trump’s cross hairs as the country is already feeling the economic ramifications of a prolonged diplomatic dispute with China, Japan’s largest trading partner. Last month, Mr. Trump threatened to raise tariffs on South Korea, saying the country was not moving fast enough to ratify its trade deal with the United States. Japan “understood there needed to be demonstrable progress,” said William Chou, a Japan expert and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a think tank. Without Japan’s investment announcements, “it was uncertain what Trump would have done — whether that was threatening a 25 percent tariff or firing off a few tweets,” Mr. Chou said. “Vibes are good between Trump and Takaichi, so why risk the unknown?” In a post on social media on Tuesday, Mr. Trump hailed the investments. “America is building again,” he wrote, adding that the projects “could not be done without one very special word, tariffs.” During a news conference on Wednesday in Tokyo, Japan’s trade minister, Ryosei Akazawa, said that each project would “promote the economic and national security interests” of both countries. Japanese companies would also benefit by supplying equipment for the projects and their related facilities, he added. Almost all of the spending in the first round of investments is slated for the construction of a natural gas power plant in Portsmouth, Ohio. The $33 billion facility is expected to be the largest natural gas power plant in the world, according to U.S. and Japanese officials. Japanese companies that have expressed interest in supplying the facility include Toshiba, Hitachi, Mitsubishi Electric and SoftBank Group, Mr. Akazawa said. In the months since Mr. Trump’s Tokyo visit, progress on how the $550 billion would be employed had been fitful. Debates have simmered in Japan over how to mobilize such vast sums of capital. Questions have been raised about the plan for the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, a state-owned lender, to serve as the primary financing vehicle for the commitment. Mr. Akazawa, who previously led Japan’s tariff negotiations with the United States, has consistently framed the investments as a “win-win” for both countries. Yet a different sentiment prevails within some business and state-backed finance circles, where the projects are often described as “strategic but less than bankable.” Japan’s investment decisions have also been complicated by an impending Supreme Court decision, expected in the coming months, about whether Mr. Trump exceeded his authority in using a 1970s law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs on dozens of U.S. trade partners. For Japan and many other nations, the threat of tariffs was a key motivator to pledge investments in the United States. That remains true even as officials, including those in Japan, seek to portray the investment decisions as purely strategic, according to David Boling, a principal at the Asia Group, a strategic advisory firm. “Would they be doing this normally? Probably not,” Mr. Boling said. But for Japan, keeping the U.S.-Japanese trade relationship in a good place is clearly the priority, he added. Strategic or not, he said, “there are other more compelling reasons to be doing this.” Hisako Ueno and Tony Romm contributed reporting.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Goldman Sachs is taking another step away from the diversity mandates the Wall Street firm had long championed. Goldman will no longer explicitly consider race, gender and sexual orientation when evaluating a potential board member at the firm, according to two people with knowledge of the bank’s decision who were unable to discuss it publicly because of the confidential nature of the move. The decision is a result of a deal that Goldman struck with the National Legal and Policy Center, a conservative nonprofit group that has been pressuring numerous companies to drop diversity, equity and inclusion mandates, the people said. The group recently announced similar deals with American Express and the equipment manufacturer Deere & Company. As part of its agreement with Goldman, the National Legal and Policy Center, which has a small investment in the bank, withdrew a shareholder proposal demanding that diversity criteria for the board be dropped. The deal was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal. Goldman’s move is part of a broader retreat by corporate America to shun diversity mandates during the Trump administration. The White House claims many of these initiatives amount to discrimination against white workers and job applicants. For years, Goldman’s chief executive, David Solomon, had been a vocal champion of the bank’s commitment to overhauling its traditionally white, male-dominated work force. In March 2019, Mr. Solomon, his top deputy John Waldron and the firm’s chief financial officer at the time, Stephen M. Scherr, declared diversity and inclusion “a top priority.” “When we unite around a common goal, we make progress together,” the men wrote in an email to the staff . They said they would “improve each year” toward goals that included a new recruiting class comprising “50 percent women, 11 percent Black professionals and 14 percent Hispanic/Latino professionals in the Americas, and 9 percent Black professionals in the U.K.” The next year, Mr. Solomon said Goldman would no longer take a company public in the United States or Europe unless it had at least one “diverse” board member. By 2021, a company would need at least two diverse board members in order for Goldman to agree to work on its initial public offering. But since President Trump returned to office, the political and legal winds on diversity have shifted, and Goldman’s commitment to D.E.I. has shifted, too. Last year, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission began questioning the hiring practices at elite law firms, claiming that their efforts to recruit Black and Hispanic lawyers may have potentially discriminated against white candidates. More recently, the agency said it was investigating “systemic allegations of D.E.I.-related intentional race discrimination” against white employees and job applicants at Nike. The sportswear company said it had been complying with the E.E.O.C.’s inquiry. Even before Mr. Trump began his second term, some diversity initiatives were facing legal scrutiny. In late 2024, a federal appeals court said Nasdaq’s rules that set racial and diversity targets for boards that listed on its exchange were invalid. Last February, Goldman said it would drop the policy that required boards of directors of U.S. companies to include women and members of minority groups if the bank was to serve as an underwriter on their initial public offerings. The same month, the firm scrapped the explicit goals it had earlier set for the racial and gender makeup of its recruiting classes. “It doesn’t change our strong belief that successful boards benefit from diverse backgrounds and perspectives,” a Goldman spokeswoman, Jennifer Zuccarelli, said of the recent moves. Goldman’s board is expected to move forward with the change to the diversity criteria for potential board members when it meets this week, the two people with knowledge of the matter said. The meeting will be the board’s first since it convened last week to consider the resignation of Goldman’s general counsel , Kathryn Ruemmler, who said she was stepping down after revelations emerged about her extensive relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. At the bank’s annual shareholder meeting last year, the National Legal and Policy Center’s associate director, Luke Perlot, praised Goldman for having “taken meaningful steps to roll back its D.E.I. programs.” Still, he proposed that the bank eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion goals around compensation for its named executive officers. On that point, the bank’s board recommended against dropping those compensation goals, and fewer than 5 percent of shareholders voted in favor eliminating them.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Revelations about ties to Jeffrey Epstein have toppled leaders of corporate America, Hollywood and academia as the Justice Department has released millions of documents and images from the disgraced financier’s files in recent months. But the Trump administration has steadfastly repelled such fallout, dismissing any associations that top officials had with the sex offender as trivial. The White House’s fortress mentality was mobilized last week after Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, acknowledged that he had traveled to Mr. Epstein’s private island and had another encounter with him years after Mr. Lutnick claimed to have cut ties with him. Such associations have led to the resignations of business leaders, but President Trump’s White House was unfazed. The stark contrast underscores the murky nature of who is deemed to be complicit and who is not when it comes to Mr. Epstein, and the Trump administration’s ability to repel even the most harsh public scrutiny. Despite bipartisan calls for Mr. Lutnick’s resignation, the White House dismissed concerns about his character and credibility. “Secretary Lutnick remains a very important member of President Trump’s team, and the president fully supports the secretary,” Karoline Leavitt, White House press secretary, said last week. Mr. Lutnick’s comments during Senate testimony contradicted his assertion on a podcast last year that he had been so disgusted by Mr. Epstein during a 2005 visit to his townhouse that Mr. Lutnick never set foot in a room with Mr. Epstein again. Mr. Lutnick’s name appeared in more than 250 documents in the Epstein files released by the Justice Department, a review by The New York Times found. He said that he first met Mr. Epstein when they became neighbors in Manhattan in 2005, but that they met only twice more over the next 14 years that he could recall. However, at the Senate hearing Mr. Lutnick confirmed that he and his family traveled to the island in 2012 for a lunch with Mr. Epstein during a vacation aboard his yacht with his wife, children, nannies and another family. The visit took place four years after Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida to soliciting prostitution from a minor as part of a deal with federal prosecutors. Mr. Lutnick is not the only prominent Trump administration official who has appeared in the Epstein documents. The records showed that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, once went hunting for dinosaur fossils with Mr. Epstein. An email in the files showed that Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, invited Mr. Epstein to a 2016 Valentine’s Day party. The Trump administration’s muted response is a striking departure from that of corporate America. Thomas J. Pritzker, a billionaire heir to the Hyatt Hotels fortune , stepped down from his role Monday as executive chairman of the Hyatt Hotels Corporation. Last week, Casey Wasserman, a Los Angeles entertainment executive and chair of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics whose name recently surfaced in the Epstein files, said he had started the process of selling the talent agency he founded more than two decades ago. And last year, Harvard started a new review of ties that its former president Lawrence H. Summers and others at the institution had with Mr. Epstein. After the release of emails between Mr. Summers and Mr. Epstein in November, Mr. Summers said he would step back from public commitments . “Corporate America, they answer to a board,” said Gene Grabowski, a Washington-based crisis communications expert. “Trump doesn’t answer to a board.” Mr. Grabowski added: “The closest thing he has is the voters, and he either doesn’t want to believe the polls or thinks he can reverse them.” A poll conducted last month by The New York Times and Siena University showed that Mr. Trump’s lowest approval rating within the Republican Party came on his handling of the release of files related to Mr. Epstein: Only 53 percent of Republicans approved of his handling of that matter. Mr. Lutnick’s ties to Mr. Epstein pale when compared with those of Mr. Trump, who socialized regularly with Mr. Epstein in the 1990s and 2000s . Using a proprietary search tool, The Times identified more than 5,300 files containing more than 38,000 references to Mr. Trump, his wife, his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, and other related words and phrases in the latest batch of emails, government files, videos and other records released by the Justice Department. Mr. Trump has downplayed his association with Mr. Epstein and accused Democrats of concocting conspiracy theories about their friendship. The president said last summer that he had ended his relationship with the financier because Mr. Epstein had “hired away” spa attendants at Mar-a-Lago. In defending Mr. Lutnick, the White House is again pushing the boundaries of its ability to weather a controversy that might have hobbled other administrations. “This administration has placed all its chips on the idea that the public will eventually tire of controversy, and now they’re betting that even allegations tied to pedophilia fall into that same bucket,” said Alexandra LaManna, who served as a spokeswoman in the Biden administration. “That’s a category of accusation that, historically, has been politically and morally radioactive.” Noting that Mr. Lutnick vacationed on Mr. Epstein’s island, she added: “It’s hard to imagine any president other than Trump trying to shrug that off.” Alan Rappeport is an economic policy reporter for The Times, based in Washington.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT This obituary was originally published on Feb. 17, 2001. It is being republished for a package for Women’s History Month. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. Rose Freedman, the last survivor of the Triangle Shirtwaist fire in which 146 of her co-workers perished in 1911, died on Thursday in her apartment in Beverly Hills, Calif., her daughter said. She was 107. Mrs. Freedman, who at the time of the Manhattan fire was two days shy of 18, escaped death in 1911 by following company executives to the roof to be rescued. She became a lifelong crusader for worker safety, telling and retelling the story that the Triangle workers died because the owners were not concerned with their welfare. The disastrous factory fire, in which girls and young women leapt from eighth- and ninth-story windows, their flaming skirts billowing in the wind, horrified the nation and led to some of the first city, state and federal laws dealing with workers’ safety. It gave a powerful impetus to the fledgling labor movement, greatly strengthening the building of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, which two years before the fire had led a three-month strike to focus attention on conditions in workplaces like the Triangle factory. The union’s successor, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, confirmed that Mrs. Freedman, who was Rose Rosenfeld at the time of the fire, was the last survivor to die. The next-to-last, Bessie Cohen, died two years ago. Mrs. Freedman’s life after the fire was colorful and courageous. In World War I, she saved the life of a spy in Austria. After her husband’s death, in 1959, she went back to work to support her three children, two of whom had polio. Lying about her age, she worked at a Manhattan insurance company until she was 79. Mrs. Freedman, who always wore high heels, celebrated her centennial by attending Spanish classes in a Mexican town with cobblestone streets, but refused to abandon her heels for more sensible shoes. “I’d look matronly,” she said. Her involvement in the fire never left her consciousness, and she appeared at labor rallies for the rest of her life. She always expressed rage that the factory doors had been locked, either to keep workers at their machines or to prevent them from stealing scraps of cloth. She always told of how one of the owners tried to bribe her to say the doors were not locked. She refused. The owners were eventually acquitted of manslaughter charges when the jury could not establish whether they had ordered the doors locked or had even known they were. But in 1914, civil suits brought by relatives of 23 victims ended with payments of $75 to each of the families. On the day of the fire, Mrs. Freedman escaped the inferno by stopping to consider what the executives were doing. She somehow thought they would be safer, and went up to the 10th floor, where their offices were, to find out. They were taking the freight elevator to the roof, where firefighters pulled them to the roof of an adjacent building. She did the same. The alternative was jumping. “Girls in shirtwaists, which were aflame, went flying out of the building so that you saw these young women literally ablaze flying out of the windows,” she said in a Public Broadcasting System documentary, “The Living Century,” shown in December and January. As she was taken down the steps of the adjacent building, she stopped on each stoop to sit down and cry. “When I came in the street, here comes my father,” she recalled. “He collapsed. He fainted. And I didn’t go back to work anymore. I went to college.” The anger about what she saw as the owners’ greed persisted. In the documentary, she said: “That’s the whole trouble of this fire. Nobody cares. Nobody. Hundred forty-six people in a half an hour. I have always tears in my eyes when I think. It should never have happened. The executives with a couple of steps could have opened the door. But they thought they were better than the working people. It’s not fair because material, money, is more important here than everything. “That’s the biggest mistake — that a person doesn’t count much when he hasn’t got money. What good is a rich man and he hasn’t got a heart? I don’t pretend. I feel it. Still.” Rose Rosenfeld was born on March 27, 1893, in a small town north of Vienna. Her family ran a profitable business importing and exporting dried foods. After her father visited New York and fell in love with it, the family began spending more and more time in the United States, finally emigrating in 1909. They sailed on the Mauretania. With Mrs. Freedman’s father devoting most of his time to Jewish studies, the business was run by her mother. An aunt who lived with the family once sharply criticized the young woman’s housecleaning abilities. “You call this work?” she demanded. Mrs. Freedman’s response was to go out the next day and take a job at the Triangle factory. Since her language skills were good — she eventually spoke seven languages — she was given the prestigious job of operating a large machine to attach buttons to the blouses. Her only close friend at the factory, a forewoman, died in the fire. She attended college in New York, although family members are not sure where. When she and her mother took a trip to their Austrian hometown to show Mrs. Freedman’s grandparents that she was really alive, World War I had broken out, and the Russians had invaded Austria. Her grandfather had befriended a man who turned out to be a Russian spying against his own country for Austria. She told of hiding him by burying him in coal in the basement, then talking the pursuing Cossacks into leaving without a search. After returning to New York, she got a job with Cunard, the steamship line. In 1927, she married Harry Freedman, an American she had first met at the American Club in Vienna. He owned a typewriter store in New York. They had three children. When the two youngest were stricken with polio, Mrs. Freedman asked when they would be able to walk. The doctor said, “Five years.” She replied, “I have time.” Mr. Freedman died at 59, leaving Mrs. Freedman no money or source of income. She got an accounting job at the Manhattan Life Insurance Company. Her youthful appearance enabled her to say she was 50, when she was actually 64. “Of course it was a lie, but they didn’t know it was a lie,” she said. She worked until she was 79. In 1995, she moved to Los Angeles, where her son Robert and her daughter, Arlene March, live. There, she became such an avid fan of the Lakers that she became livid if someone phoned while a game was being shown on television. On her 100th birthday she was presented with a team jersey bearing the number 100. She exhibited paintings at the Beverly Hills Art Fair, and continued to paint almost until her death. She had her hair and nails done weekly, and shopped and cooked for herself. Mrs. Freedman was still attending Spanish language classes at 107. “To me, 106 is a number,” she said in the documentary. “I lived that long, not only on account of my genes, but on account of my attitude. You’ve got to stand up for yourself. Am I right?” Other survivors are another son, Herbert, of Rye Brook, N.Y., eight grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. She was overjoyed at the great-granddaughter’s birth, and always advised the child’s mother, her granddaughter, Dana Walden, who is president of 20th Century Fox Television, not to get caught in grief when loved ones died. “Sadness takes years from you,” she said. Her own passing ends a chapter of history. Steven Latham, director of the documentary, suggested it was something like the last Holocaust survivor dying. “This is the last voice of an event,” he said. “This woman actually smelled the smoke.” Share full article Related Content Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Bayer, the German pharmaceutical and biotech giant, said Tuesday that it had reached an agreement that would pay plaintiffs $7.25 billion to settle tens of thousands of lawsuits that claimed the weedkiller Roundup caused non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The agreement was submitted to a Missouri circuit court judge in St. Louis, and approval is not guaranteed. A $10 billion settlement unraveled in 2020 after a judge objected to how future claims would be handled. The latest deal would cover both current and future claims, and create a fund that Bayer would pay into over the next 17 to 21 years, according to a company statement. Bayer executives hailed the agreement as a significant step in the company’s efforts to control costs from litigation against Roundup, which Monsanto developed in the 1970s. Bayer acquired Monsanto in 2016. Since then, the company has set aside $10 billion to settle lawsuits over the herbicide. With this settlement, Bayer’s legal costs would approach $14 billion in total, according to Bayer’s statement. Bill Anderson, Bayer’s chief executive, previously said the company would stop manufacturing Roundup, which farmers around the world use to kill weeds and increase crop yields, if it couldn’t find a way to end the lawsuits. “Today marks an important milestone for the company,” Mr. Anderson said on a call announcing the settlement. Shares of Bayer rose more than 7 percent after the announcement. A major factor in driving the settlement is an upcoming Supreme Court case that will decide whether federal law shields Bayer from many Roundup-related lawsuits. Most of the lawsuits against Bayer have been filed in state courts, arguing that the company violated state labeling laws because it did not warn users that Roundup could cause cancer. Bayer argues that the Environmental Protection Agency has found Roundup to be safe and that, according to federal labeling standards, it should be protected from the more than 40,000 active lawsuits, of 170,000 total, that have been filed against the company. Ensuring that those suing received some compensation before the Supreme Court ruling was paramount. “If Monsanto prevails, many claims nationwide would be dismissed or curtailed,” said Christopher Seeger, one of the plaintiffs’ lawyers. If the settlement is approved, it will not be affected by the outcome of the Supreme Court case. Mr. Anderson, the Bayer chief executive, said the settlement “complements” the Supreme Court case, even though many of the cases that Bayer is settling could be invalidated if the justices rule in its favor. He said this agreement and a Supreme Court win would provide “the tightest possible form of containment” of litigation, by settling existing cases and making future cases easier to win. Bayer has played legal Whac-a-Mole since it acquired Monsanto, settling tens of thousands of suits against Roundup before reaching a trial. But a number have gone to trial and resulted in verdicts of hundreds of millions of dollars for a single case. Many of those awards have been reduced on appeal.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Stephen Colbert said on his late-night show on Monday that his network, CBS, barred him from airing an interview with a Democratic candidate for a U.S. Senate race because of new guidance from the Trump administration about equal airtime for political candidates. It’s the first time that a late-night talk show has changed its programming to meet the demands of that update from the Federal Communications Commission, which has over the last year ramped up its efforts to crack down on the major media companies for perceived bias. Mr. Colbert, a frequent critic of President Trump, made it clear he did not make the change willingly. Over six minutes on Monday’s edition of “The Late Show,” Mr. Colbert blasted Brendan Carr, the chairman of the F.C.C. And, in a rebuke of CBS, Mr. Colbert said that “because my network clearly doesn’t want us to talk about this, let’s talk about this.” Mr. Colbert said that CBS lawyers had told him “in no uncertain terms” that an interview he had planned for Monday’s show with State Representative James Talarico of Texas would not air on the show, even though the lawmaker was already in Mr. Colbert’s studio. Early voting began on Tuesday in the Texas primary election, where Mr. Talarico is competing against Jasmine Crockett to be the state’s Democratic nominee to run against Senator John Cornyn, a Republican. Mr. Colbert pointed to new guidance from the F.C.C. from January, warning media companies that talk shows carried on local broadcast networks were required to offer equal airtime to candidates competing for the same office. CBS pushed back on Mr. Colbert’s version of events on Tuesday, saying the network had “not prohibited” the interview from airing but that it instead “provided legal guidance” that broadcasting the interview could trigger the F.C.C. equal-time rule. CBS said it then presented the show “options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled.” There has long been an exemption to the F.C.C.’s equal-time rule for “bona fide news” programming, such as evening news programs. Media companies have long taken it as a given that late-night shows qualified for the same exemption, particularly after the F.C.C. ruled in 2006 that interviews on “The Tonight Show With Jay Leno” were considered bona fide news. After the F.C.C. issued its new guidance, Mr. Carr underscored that was no longer the case. “For years, legacy TV networks assumed that their late-night & daytime talk shows qualify as ‘bona fide news’ programs — even when motivated by purely partisan political purposes,” he said on X last month. “Today, the F.C.C. reminded them of their obligation to provide all candidates with equal opportunities.” Representatives for the F.C.C. and Mr. Colbert declined to comment. Mr. Trump has repeatedly lashed out against many late-night hosts since he returned to the White House last year — just this weekend, he insulted Bill Maher, the HBO talk show host, in a post on Truth Social. Mr. Carr has taken particular aim at late night and daytime television shows that he believes are biased. Last year, ABC removed “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” from its airwaves for almost a week after Mr. Carr suggested that the administration could punish the network because of remarks the late-night host had made in a monologue. Earlier this month, the F.C.C. started a probe into ABC’s “The View” because of an interview with Mr. Talarico, Fox News reported . On Monday’s show, Mr. Colbert repeatedly criticized Mr. Carr, at one point saying that he looked like a “smug bowling pin,” and saying that he believed Mr. Carr was “motivated by partisan purposes.” “Let’s just call this what it is,” Mr. Colbert said. “Donald Trump’s administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV because all Trump does is watch TV.” Mr. Colbert went on to say that he and Mr. Kimmel were “two of the people most affected by this threat” because they had promptly criticized the new guidance when it was announced last month. Because the equal-time provisions apply only to broadcast airwaves, Mr. Colbert announced his interview with Mr. Talarico would be posted to his show’s YouTube page, though he said that network lawyers told him not to give out a URL or a QR code to the link. That interview had more than 1.7 million views on YouTube early Tuesday afternoon, significantly more than the 93,000 views of a video of Mr. Colbert interviewing Jennifer Garner, who was also a guest on Monday’s episode. The F.C.C.’s lone Democratic commissioner, Anna Gomez, said on Tuesday that CBS’s refusal to air the interview was “another troubling example of corporate capitulation in the face of this administration’s broader campaign to censor and control speech.” Mr. Colbert is in his final months hosting “The Late Show,” which will go off the air in May. CBS has said that the show’s cancellation was “purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night,” but many have continued to speculate that the network removed the show for political reasons. CBS’s parent company, Paramount, is also competing with Netflix to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery. Any deal would require the blessing of the federal government.

Billy Barraclough for The New York Times Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 3:36 min Learn more Share full article 6 By Katie Robertson Feb. 17, 2026 Adam Baidawi recalls being enthralled by GQ magazine the first time he pored through an issue as a teenager in suburban Melbourne, Australia. Some two decades later — and on the other side of the world — Mr. Baidawi will now take the helm of the men’s magazine as its next global editorial director. Condé Nast, the publisher of GQ and other brands like Vogue and The New Yorker, on Tuesday announced Mr. Baidawi’s promotion to the top job, effective immediately. Mr. Baidawi, 35, who led British GQ and was the deputy global editorial director, will now oversee all of GQ, including its U.S. publication and its global editions, as well as the music publication Pitchfork , which was folded into GQ in 2024. He replaces the longtime GQ editor Will Welch , who announced in January after a run atop the masthead that he was leaving to move to Paris to work with Pharrell Williams, the musician and men’s creative director for Louis Vuitton. Mr. Baidawi’s appointment is the latest shake-up of the top editorial ranks at Condé Nast, which in recent months has promoted a new generation of internal talent. In June, Mark Guiducci , the 37-year-old creative director of Vogue, became the top editor of Vanity Fair. And last fall, Chloe Malle , 40, the editor of Vogue’s website, succeeded Anna Wintour as American Vogue’s top editor. (Ms. Wintour, 76, remains Vogue’s global editorial director as well as the chief content officer for Condé Nast.) Mr. Baidawi, who is Iraqi Australian, started his career as a music writer and wrote freelance articles for the Australian edition of GQ. He spent a year as an Australia correspondent for The New York Times before spotting a job advertisement looking for someone to launch GQ Middle East. He was named the editor in chief of GQ Middle East in 2018 at age 28, making him the youngest-ever editor in chief of a GQ edition.

Billy Barraclough for The New York Times In 2021, Mr. Baidawi became the deputy global editorial director of GQ and the head of editorial content of British GQ. In an interview from London, Mr. Baidawi said he wanted to restore GQ “to its rightful place as the North Star of masculinity” and to have the magazine be “more participatory in the cultural and political debates of our time.” Mr. Baidawi added that while there was a lot of hand wringing currently about the online “manosphere” and toxic masculinity, the current counterprogramming amounted to lectures and earnestness. “I’m curious to propose a version of masculinity that is yes, progressive, yes, modern, but is also sexier and cooler and more aspirational and more desirable than some of the nihilism or cruelty or vanity that we see out there,” he said. Mr. Baidawi also said he planned to incorporate more long-form video and long-form audio into the GQ brand. In a statement, Ms. Wintour described Mr. Baidawi as “a cultural thinker at a time when the culture needs to be thought through, and even interrogated a little.” “This is someone GQ’s readers can expect to challenge received wisdom — about modern masculinity and the worlds of celebrity, sport and fashion — and have a lot of fun doing so,” she said. Mr. Baidawi will relocate to New York, and his first print issue of GQ will publish in September. Katie Robertson covers the media industry for The Times.

Ricardo Nagaoka for The New York Times In today's newsletter: Paramount notches a win More Epstein files fallout Anthropic’s latest fight with Washington Goldman’s latest retreat on diversity Andrew here. Hope you enjoyed the long weekend. Today, Lauren Hirsch dives into Warner Bros. Discovery restarting merger talks with Paramount and explains what would make it walk away from a deal with Netflix. We also examine Goldman Sachs’s reported decision to drop a diversity requirement for its board. And we look at more fallout from the Epstein files. Paramount notches a win Paramount has sought for weeks to force Warner Bros. Discovery back to the M.&A. negotiating table. On Tuesday, it has finally received a chance to win the battle over the movie and television studio. Warner Bros. Discovery just said that it would restart merger talks with Paramount , giving its suitor roughly a week to make its case to abandon its deal with Netflix. Warner Bros. Discovery isn’t definitely switching sides. Its deal agreement with Netflix gives it the right to talk with a rival bidder if that is likely to lead to a “reasonably superior offer.” Warner Bros. Discovery doesn’t think that’s the case here — but Netflix has given it until Feb. 23 to talk with Paramount to clarify several questions about that company’s competing offer. For now, Warner Bros. Discovery’s board is still recommending that shareholders vote in favor of the Netflix offer. Netflix added in a separate statement: “This does not change the fact that we have the only signed, board-recommended agreement with W.B.D., and ours is the only certain path to delivering value to W.B.D.’s stockholders.” But Paramount has made headway in casting doubt on that. The rival studio has argued that its bid — a deal for all of Warner Bros. Discovery, instead of the more complicated structure of the Netflix transaction, which involves spinning out the Warner cable networks — offers more certainty for shareholders. It doesn’t hurt that a Paramount representative has said the company would raise its takeover price to $31 a share if the Warner Bros. Discovery board authorized talks, and suggested that the company could pay even more. (Paramount has already tossed in sweeteners such as offering to cover the Netflix deal’s $2.8 billion breakup fee and to pay Warner Bros. Discovery a quarterly “ticking fee” if its deal closes behind schedule.) And several Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders, including the hedge funds Ancora and Pentwater Capital Management , have pushed the studio operator to reopen talks with Paramount. (Warner Bros. Discovery has now set March 20 as the date for an investor vote on the Netflix offer.) Big questions remain: How much higher would Netflix be willing to raise its offer for any counterbid? Worth noting: Shares in the streaming giant rose this morning, after having fallen since clinching a deal for Warner Bros. Discovery. How would Paramount finance a higher takeover bid, given that Warner Bros. Discovery has expressed concern about how much debt it already plans to use ? HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING The Fed weighs moves to bolster bank lending. The central bank is preparing to ease capital requirements for U.S. banks , a vice chair, Michelle Bowman, announced on Monday. Banks have seen their share of mortgage originations in the U.S. fall to 35 percent in 2023 from 60 percent in 2008, Bowman said. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has blamed capital regulations for driving lending to nonbank financial services companies. California and Britain strike a clean energy deal. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an agreement on Monday that calls for the two sides to bolster efforts to collaborate on green tech and invest in clean energy. It comes as the Trump administration has dismantled some legal protections for climate and Biden administration initiatives to advance a low-carbon transition. President Trump called the deal “ inappropriate .” The Fed, earnings and inflation data top investors’ agenda this week. Minutes from the central bank’s January meeting are set for release on Wednesday, offering clues about policymakers’ thinking on interest rates. Walmart, Wayfair and Klarna report quarterly results on Thursday, providing more insight on the state of the consumer. The Personal Consumption Expenditures report, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, is scheduled for publication on Friday. Image More Epstein files fallout The Jeffrey Epstein files continue to jolt corporate America , including Hollywood. The heat is also growing in Washington and academia . The latest: Thomas Pritzker, a scion of the Hyatt Hotels empire, stepped down on Monday as executive chairman of the hotels giant, after the files revealed that he was in regular contact with the convicted sex offender in the years after Epstein’s 2008 plea deal on sex crimes charges. Pritzker and Epstein corresponded frequently as they arranged appointments, including visits to Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse. In a 2018 email exchange, Pritzker agreed to help Karyna Shuliak, Epstein’s girlfriend, arrange a trip to Southeast Asia. After Shuliak told Pritzker she was going there “to try to find a new girlfriend for Jeffrey,” Pritzker responded with a smiley-face emoticon and wrote, “May the Force be with you.” Pritzker said in a statement released on Monday that he had “exercised terrible judgment in maintaining contact with” Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s longtime companion. “There is no excuse for failing to distance myself sooner,” he added. Pritzker, a cousin of JB Pritzker, a Democrat and the governor of Illinois, also said he would not seek re-election to Hyatt’s board in May. And then there’s Casey Wasserman. The sports and entertainment mogul, whose decades-old flirtatious messages with Maxwell appeared in the files, is facing increased pressure to step down as chairman of LA28 , the organizing committee for the Olympics in Los Angeles. Karen Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles, on Monday became the highest-ranking elected official to call on Wasserman to resign from LA28. “I do think that we need to look at the leadership,” she said after criticizing the Olympic organizers’ decision last week to back Wasserman. Wasserman announced on Friday that he had begun the process of selling the Wasserman Group , his powerhouse talent agency that has experienced some high-profile defections since the latest Epstein revelations. “I’m deeply sorry that my past personal mistakes have caused you so much discomfort,” he wrote to employees. In related news, some politicians in Ohio have begun distancing themselves from Les Wexner . Wexner, the billionaire founder of L Brands and an early patron of Epstein, had been a major donor to several local races there. Attorney General Pam Bondi’s combative congressional testimony last week over the Epstein investigation continued to draw anger from the right. Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, said he had lost confidence in Bondi days after some right-wing political commentators called for her resignation . Anthropic’s latest fight with Washington Anthropic’s stated focus on safety has set it apart in the artificial intelligence race — and drawn the ire of some White House officials. A new report suggests that the Trump administration is weighing a move that could deal the A.I. start-up a big blow, underscoring a major disagreement between the two sides on how to deploy the technology. The Pentagon is threatening to cut ties with Anthropic, and more, Axios reports . More specifically, the Defense Department is considering designating Anthropic a “supply chain risk,” meaning that other military contractors would have to stop working with the company, too. It’s a designation typically reserved for overseas adversaries, Axios adds. The threat aris",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Warner Bros. Discovery said on Tuesday that it would restart the deal talks with Paramount Skydance that it ended in December, giving the company another chance at besting Netflix for a deal. Paramount will have until Feb. 23 to negotiate its best and final offer. Warner Bros. Discovery last year rejected Paramount’s offer to buy the entire company for $108 billion in favor of a deal to sell only its streaming and studios business to Netflix for $83 billion. Warner Bros. Discovery said at the time that Netflix offered the better deal for shareholders. Paramount disagreed and quickly made its case to shareholders through a hostile bid . In the roughly two months since then, Paramount has amended its offer twice , each time addressing some of the concerns that Warner Bros. Discovery’s board had raised. Paramount’s chief executive, David Ellison, has also raised questions about the Netflix bid, including whether its deal can pass regulatory scrutiny. Some Warner Bros. Discovery investors, including Pentwater Capital Management, have also raised concerns, encouraging the company to restart talks with Paramount. Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Skydance were both up about 3 percent in premarket trading. To date, Paramount has not publicly raised its offer from $30 a share. But last week, Warner Bros. Discovery said that a senior representative for Paramount had verbally informed a company board member that, if the board authorized talks with Paramount, it would agree to pay $31 a share. In that conversation, the Paramount representative added that it would be willing to further improve its offer. “It’s about time the actual headline price bidding heated up in what has to be one of the most inactive corporate bidding wars in history,” Eric Talley, a business professor at Columbia Law School, said. In a letter to the Paramount board on Tuesday, David Zaslav, the chief executive of Warner Bros. Discovery, and Samuel A. DiPiazza Jr., chairman of the company, said: “We welcome the opportunity to engage with you and expeditiously determine whether PSKY can deliver an actionable, binding proposal that provides superior value.” In Paramount’s latest offer, it agreed to pay the $2.8 billion fee Warner Bros. Discovery would owe to Netflix if their agreement were terminated, as well as agreeing to back Warner Bros. Discovery’s debt costs. Paramount also said it would pay Warner Bros. Discovery’s shareholders around $650 million in cash, starting in 2027, for each quarter that the deal did not close. Warner Bros. Discovery said Tuesday that it had requested a number of clarifications about Paramount’s latest proposal. Among them were concerns about the extent of Paramount’s support for Warner Bros. Discovery’s debt costs and the conditions under which Paramount could legally walk away from a deal. It also wanted assurances that Paramount would be willing to contribute more equity if its debt financing fell apart. According to the terms of Warner Bros. Discovery’s contract with Netflix, it can engage in talks with a rival bidder if it thinks it can lead to a “reasonably superior offer.” Warner Bros. Discovery said in its letter on Tuesday that it did not yet think that Paramount’s offer met that bar — but that Netflix had given Warner Bros. Discovery a seven-day waiver to see if it could clarify its concerns. “Throughout the robust and highly competitive strategic review process, Netflix has consistently taken a constructive, responsive approach with WBD, in stark contrast to Paramount Skydance,” Netflix said in a statement released on Tuesday. “While we are confident that our transaction provides superior value and certainty, we recognize the ongoing distraction for WBD stockholders and the broader entertainment industry caused by PSKY’s antics.” On Tuesday, Paramount acknowledged Warner Bros. Discovery’s decision, saying in a statement that it had opted to secure a waiver rather than deeming Paramount’s bid as one that could be reasonably expected to be superior. In doing so, Paramount said, Warner Bros. Discovery did not allow itself “an unfettered right to negotiate without a time deadline.” “Although the board’s actions are unusual,” the statement said, “Paramount is nonetheless prepared to engage in good faith and constructive discussions.” If Paramount makes a superior offer, Netflix has the right to improve its own bid. Shares of Netflix have been under pressure since it announced the deal in December, falling about 15 percent this year. Its stock rose 1.5 percent in premarket trading. Discovery said on Tuesday that it had scheduled a shareholder vote on Netflix’s offer for March 20. Lauren Hirsch is a Times reporter who covers deals and dealmakers in Wall Street and Washington.

Eric Lee for The New York Times Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 11:29 min Learn more Share full article 485 By Tony Romm Reporting from Washington Feb. 17, 2026 Shortly after returning to office, President Trump embarked on an aggressive campaign to pare back the core functions of the federal government, unveiling a budget that proposed some of the steepest spending reductions in U.S. history. Nearly one year later, Congress has rejected much of that vision. In a little-noticed development, lawmakers have systematically brushed off many of Mr. Trump’s most severe cuts for this fiscal year, leaving intact a vast set of federal education, health, housing and research programs that the White House had tried to slash or eliminate. For Mr. Trump, the result is a set of annual government expenses that do not appear radically different on paper compared with what he inherited in January 2025. Overall, Congress is on track to approve more than $1.6 trillion in discretionary spending for 2026, amounting to little change from the previous fiscal year, according to a preliminary analysis of federal budget records by the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan research organization.

Targeting primarily domestic programs, Mr. Trump had originally recommended about $163 billion in deep spending cuts . But lawmakers often did not abide, and in the end, some of the funding that the president had tried to erase — including for medical research, college aid and benefits for poor people — instead changed only slightly, the data show. Mr. Trump still prevailed in other ways, most notably in his efforts to scale back the size and reach of government by ousting thousands of federal workers. Still, the outcome on Capitol Hill underscores the complex and fraught politics of austerity: Where the president sees evidence of spending that is woke, weaponized or wasteful , his critics in both parties see money that is essential to their communities and the broader economy. At times, the difficult dynamic has put the White House at odds with some congressional Republicans, many of whom are up for re-election this November. That has only reinforced Mr. Trump’s desire to circumvent lawmakers altogether, using a series of contested and potentially illegal maneuvers to revoke billions in congressionally approved spending that the president disfavors. Kent Smetters, the faculty director for the Penn Wharton Budget Model, said that, for now, Congress had “basically rejected” everything that Mr. Trump had sought. By law, the White House must send Congress a budget by the first Monday in February — a deadline that presidents from both parties have regularly missed without consequence. The administration is expected to release its latest blueprint for the 2027 fiscal year as soon as next month. Still, Mr. Smetters added that the result this year illustrated a well-worn truth that presidential budgets are “aspirational in nature,” and that in the fight to trim spending, there are always “strong vested interests” for keeping federal funds intact. To come to the preliminary budget estimates, The New York Times analyzed spending across the 11 appropriations bills adopted by Congress, primarily using early data furnished by Democrats on the Senate Appropriations Committee and a set of outside groups, including Penn Wharton. A final, 12th bill, covering homeland security, has not yet passed. Top Republican appropriators did not respond to requests for comment. The analysis focused primarily on domestic spending, not defense, which Mr. Trump has increased considerably in his first year back in office. He secured some of that military funding as part of his sprawling tax legislation, which was paid for in part by cutting back benefits in programs like Medicaid and food stamps. In effect, the changes broke with a long-running tradition in Washington to treat defense and domestic spending with parity, a development that the administration sees as one of its signature victories. The White House nonetheless maintains that it has meaningfully changed the nation’s fiscal trajectory during Mr. Trump’s second term. The administration has already moved to shutter entire agencies and revoke billions in spending previously authorized by Congress. That includes rescinding about $14 billion that lawmakers adopted for foreign aid and public broadcasting last year. Some of the cuts, including federal support for the organization that funds NPR, were sustained by Congress in recent months, which helped to lower the overall amount spent by the government in 2026, according to officials at the White House budget office, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe their thinking. “The appropriations bills, reconciliation, rescissions, all the different tools we are using — it’s the end of futility,” Russell T. Vought, the director of the budget office, said in a statement, referring to the legislative processes that allowed Mr. Trump to enact his tax legislation and repeal past spending. Image President Trump’s budget proposed some of the steepest spending cuts in U.S. history. Credit... Kenny Holston/The New York Times Marc Goldwein, the senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said that the president’s actions in his first year in office carried mixed budgetary implications. On one hand, he said the Trump administration did not “get a big nominal cut in spending” in Congress for the 2026 fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30. But Mr. Goldwein, whose group supports deficit reduction, said the White House did manage to ward off perennial spending increases for domestic programs, which still amounted to a “big victory.” Last spring, for example, Mr. Trump took his first steps to try to dismantle the Education Department, where he and his aides froze funds and either fired or reassigned staff members without congressional approval. Yet Democrats and Republicans adopted a funding deal in late January that provisioned $79 billion for the agency, a slight increase from 2025, the data show. They also rejected some of the president’s ideas, including his attempt to sharply reduce funding for Pell grants, which aid low-income college students. At the White House, officials said they still believe that they can proceed with their attempts to dissolve the department and relocate its staff this year, arguing that the new funding legislation did not explicitly prevent them from doing so. Lawmakers similarly rejected steep cuts proposed by Mr. Trump for agencies including the Departments of Commerce, Labor and Health and Human Services, which saw only slight changes to their overall, annual budgets, the records show. And they jettisoned some of Mr. Trump’s most significant attempts to whittle down antipoverty programs, particularly federal housing assistance. The president initially proposed overhauling — and halving — the funding for a stable of benefits that includes housing vouchers, which serve about 2.4 million low-income households . But Congress did not weigh his proposed restructuring. Instead",

Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 4:13 min Learn more Share full article 2 By Natallie Rocha Visuals by Minh Connors Reporting from San Francisco Feb. 17, 2026 If you had to ask whose forehead was plastered on a billboard along San Francisco’s Route 101 last month, you were clearly not in the start-up world. The large ad, declaring “Target Marc on TV,” was among a smattering of head-scratching billboards by Vibe, a New York-based advertising technology start-up, that put the insider culture of tech on full display. The forehead alluded to one of the tech industry’s most well-known investors, Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Another nearby wallscape showed just a leather-clad shoulder, a nod to Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chip maker Nvidia, who is known for his fondness for black motorcycle jackets . A billboard for Elon Musk, the Tesla mogul who also owns the social media network X, pictured a kitchen sink — a nod to a viral video of Mr. Musk carrying a sink into Twitter’s office in 2022 with the caption “let that sink in.” Image The forehead of the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen can be quickly spotted by a subset of tech industry insiders. Vibe’s campaign, which ran through January, was playing a tech industry insider game: targeting a tiny audience of tech investors and influencers who would get the joke and — just maybe — try to find who was behind those billboards. And while other ad campaigns have forced Bay Area residents to decode tech lingo, Vibe’s billboards took obscurity to a new level of microtargeting. “These are people that everyone in the Valley wants to talk to,” said Arthur Querou, chief executive of Vibe, which creates targeting and analytics software for companies to run advertisements on streaming services. Mr. Querou said one of Vibe’s products offered an advertising algorithm to place streaming ads in front of specific people, like executives in a particular region. That’s why, he said, the recent billboards nod to Silicon Valley celebrities who clients may want to “target” on TV. “It’s very recognizable,” Mr. Querou said of the ad campaign. “Of course, a lot of people in S.F. will not understand the joke, but the people we want to talk to do get the joke.” Image The “Jensen” in question is Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia who often wears black leather jackets. There are billions being invested in San Francisco’s start-up scene right now, and a lot of that money will go toward marketing. Mr. Querou hopes his analog ads will lead start-ups to put some of that cash toward streaming ads with his firm. Advertising on a San Francisco billboard or wallscape can cost anywhere from $15,000 for a downtown ad to the low six figures for prime signage along Route 101 for about six weeks, said Christopher Tavlarides, president of Capitol Outdoor, which owns about 30 billboards across the Bay Area. Mr. Tavlarides said the demand for ad space had increased over the past year, especially for billboards near certain tech offices or venture capital firms. But for those who aren’t in on the joke, the deluge of tech ads have become white noise. “To be honest, it’s too vague for me, and I feel that’s the point,” said James Markert, looking up at a brick wall that said “Target Tim on TV” next to a bitten red apple. The “Tim” in question was Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple. Image Another billboard refers to Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple. Mr. Markert, a bartender in the city’s Jackson Square neighborhood, said he had no idea what “Tim” this ad was targeting. While Vibe’s billboards have gone viral online, Mr. Querou said he was “a bit sad” to not have heard from the tech executives they called out yet. Representatives for Apple, Nvidia and SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment. Image One of Vibe’s billboards was inspired by a 2022 video of Elon Musk carrying a sink during his takeover of Twitter. Still, Mr. Querou received plenty of texts from friends he went to college with at the University of California, Berkeley. Some of them now work in San Francisco as engineers at big tech companies, not start-ups, and sent him pictures of the billboards. But they still didn’t know whom the “Marc” ads were targeting, he said. Danielle Jing, who works at a start-up down the block from the Jackson Square Apple ad, didn’t get the joke. She squinted up at the wallscape on her walk back to the office on a recent evening and said it must just be for “online tech people.” But the forehead billboard along Route 101? She said she immediately knew that reference because she used to work in venture capital. Mr. Andreessen, the owner of that viral forehead, did not respond to a request for comment.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT For nearly 20 years, Anderson Cooper has had a rare double billing in the TV industry: anchor on CNN and correspondent for “60 Minutes,” the celebrated newsmagazine on CBS. Now, he’s back to being a solo act. On Monday evening, Mr. Cooper said he was leaving “60 Minutes” to spend more time with his two young sons “while they still want to spend time with me.” “Being a correspondent at ‘60 Minutes’ has been one of the great honors of my career,” Mr. Cooper said. “I got to tell amazing stories, and work with some of the best producers, editors and camera crews in the business.” After juggling his jobs at CNN and CBS with the demands of raising two boys, Mr. Cooper said, he wants “to spend as much time with them as possible.” Mr. Cooper’s departure will be a blow for “60 Minutes,” where he has been a contributor since 2006. Over the years, Mr. Cooper, 58, has become one of the program’s most recognizable journalists, winning Emmy Awards for his coverage of sexual assault in the Democratic Republic of Congo and for a story about an unlikely group of Grammy-nominated musicians in Malawi’s Zomba Prison. In a statement, CBS News said it was thankful that Mr. Cooper had “taken ‘60 Minutes’ viewers on journeys to faraway places, told us unforgettable stories, reported consequential investigations and interviewed many prominent figures.” “We’re grateful to him for dedicating so much of his life to this broadcast, and understand the importance of spending more time with family,” the statement said. “‘60 Minutes’ will be here if he ever wants to return.” “60 Minutes” has come under scrutiny recently because of tensions between its on-air correspondents and Bari Weiss, the recently appointed editor in chief of CBS News. The program itself became a story late last year after Ms. Weiss made a last-minute decision to hold a segment about a prison in El Salvador over the objections of Sharyn Alfonsi, the veteran “60 Minutes” correspondent who covered the story. Ms. Weiss said the piece needed more reporting; Ms. Alfonsi said the decision was motivated by politics. The story eventually ran with minimal changes. Ms. Weiss later said in a town-hall meeting with employees in January that she had no desire to repeat “that specific logistical nightmare,” of pulling a story so close to broadcast, ever again. In recent years, Mr. Cooper’s career has encompassed much more than TV news. He has written several books, most recently a historical biography chronicling the wealthy Astor family. (Mr. Cooper is a scion of another Gilded Age dynasty, the Vanderbilts.) He also hosts a podcast about grief and bereavement, “All There Is,” which explores loss with in-depth interviews. Mr. Cooper’s departure was earlier reported by Breaker, an email newsletter. Benjamin Mullin reports for The Times on the major companies behind news and entertainment.

Haiyun Jiang/The New York Times Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 15:18 min Learn more Share full article By Ana Swanson Ana Swanson has written about international trade for over a decade. She reported from Washington. Feb. 16, 2026 On Jan. 26, 2025, Jamieson Greer was teaching Sunday school to a group of 9-year-olds when one of his phones started blowing up with calls from the White House. Six days into the new administration, President Trump was already deploying his favorite weapon: the threat of crippling tariffs to bend countries to his will. This time, the president was threatening Colombia, after it refused to accept U.S. military planes of deported immigrants. Mr. Greer would not join the Trump administration for some time yet, but he was already a key adviser on trade, flying to Mar-a-Lago in the weeks before to help plan Mr. Trump’s agenda. “Why do you have two phones?” a student asked him. “I have a kind of crazy job,” Mr. Greer replied. As the United States trade representative, Mr. Greer, 45, has been a powerful but behind-the-scenes force in transforming the global economy. His calm demeanor is often overshadowed in a cabinet filled with outspoken, brash billionaires. Yet few have done more in Mr. Trump’s second term to put into practice the president’s vision of altering the system governing how trillions of dollars of goods move around the world. Mr. Greer has provided the legal and policy framework to overhaul a global system Mr. Trump slams as unfair. He has helped the president raise tariffs to their highest levels in nearly a century while simultaneously leading negotiations with all of America’s biggest trading partners. So far, he has helped Mr. Trump reach initial trade arrangements with dozens of countries. Interviews with Mr. Greer make clear that he is a true believer in Mr. Trump’s plan to use tariffs to revitalize the United States manufacturing sector. He and other advisers have ushered in steep import taxes to try to protect manufacturers from foreign competition, coax more factories into the United States and create more good-paying factory jobs. “What the president has done is amazing,” Mr. Greer said in an interview in January. “He has restructured global trade.” It’s not yet clear those initiatives will work. Manufacturing employs less than 10 percent of Americans, and the number of factory workers has been dwindling. While some manufacturers support protectionism, others say it raises their costs and makes U.S. industry less competitive. Consumers are also concerned about tariffs increasing prices , and polls show Mr. Trump losing support for his handling of the economy. Though Mr. Greer credits the president’s tariff threats with giving him leverage in negotiations, Mr. Trump’s penchant for brinkmanship has clearly added uncertainty and complications to how countries deal with the United States. Mr. Trump has continued to threaten countries with tariffs, even if they have already agreed to trade deals, leaving companies unsure how permanent his policies are. This year seems likely to bring more tumult, as the Supreme Court reviews whether to overturn many of these tariffs. The administration is also preparing for high-stakes meetings with China, and negotiations with Canada and Mexico that could transform or dissolve the North American trade deal. Mr. Greer is often seen as a source of stability in the chaos. A former Mormon missionary and military lawyer, he has quietly navigated the demands of an unpredictable president, other big personalities in the cabinet, and the dozens of foreign leaders and company executives whose fortunes are tied up in trade. Friends say he has followed the advice of his mentor and former boss, Robert E. Lighthizer, who served as the U.S. trade representative in Mr. Trump’s first term: “You can get a lot done in Washington if you don’t care who gets the credit.” Mr. Greer’s small agency has only about 250 people, and he has not always been included in important administration decisions. In April, as he was testifying before Congress to defend the global tariffs Mr. Trump had just announced, the president surprised lawmakers and Mr. Greer by suddenly pausing them. But those close to Mr. Greer say he has built a solid relationship with the president. Mr. Trump has turned to him to coordinate issues beyond trade, like investment and security deals with Saudi Arabia, Cambodia and Thailand. Mr. Greer said that while he may not be a billionaire or political celebrity like other officials, he was chosen for a simple reason: “I know my brief.” Reading ‘Les Mis’ in Mortaritaville Image Mr. Greer during his time serving as a military lawyer in Iraq, where he was stationed at a base known as “Mortaritaville.” Credit... via the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative Mr. Greer is known as being preternaturally calm, a trait that some who know him say stems from being the father of five children. He credited his time as a military lawyer in Iraq, where he had to pause cross-examinations to shelter under a desk from mortar fire. “Listen, as long as nobody’s bombing me, I’m in good shape,” he said. Mr. Greer’s membership among Washington’s elite was not predictable. Raised in a working-class family in Paradise, Calif., he grew up in a mobile home, the fourth of five children, and worked during the summers and school year as a dishwasher and at McDonald’s. His parents valued education and Mr. Greer was drawn to the yellow-trimmed National Geographics that arrived in the mail each month. He attended Brigham Young University and served for two years during college as a Mormon missionary in Belgium, France and Luxembourg. In a white shirt and tie, Mr. Greer spent his days speaking to locals and refugees from Kosovo and Rwanda, an experience that opened his eyes to international relations and taught him fluent French that he still uses in trade negotiations. At B.Y.U., Mr. Greer joined the military and met his future wife, Marlo. After law school in Virginia and a stint studying in Paris, he served as a military lawyer in Kansas, Turkey and Iraq, where he was stationed at a base nicknamed “Mortaritaville,” reading “Les Misérables” in French between bombardments.

Credit... Rod Lamkey/Associated Press He was set on a path toward his future role as the architect of Mr. Trump’s trade strategy by what he called a “serendipitous” interview with Mr. Lighthizer for a job in Washington at the law firm Skadden Arps. Mr. Lighthizer said Mr. Greer impressed him as someone with “brains and values,” and hired Mr. Greer in 2012 to help the firm defend U.S. Steel and other American companies in trade cases. That work gave Mr. Greer an advance look at what U.S. industries would face in the coming years, as Chinese exports heavily subsidized by Beijing flooded global markets. Jeffrey Gerrish, who worked with Mr. Greer at Skadden Arps and at the trade representative’s office, said Mr. Greer was “right on the front lines” as Chinese goods began decimating U.S. industry. “He saw the kinds of impacts that it was having, not only on the companies, but on the workers and really entire communities,” Mr. Gerrish said. Mr. Greer saw the influx of cheap goods as a national security issue, but few Republicans or Democrats agreed. That changed with Mr. Trump’s election in 2016, when Mr. Lighthizer became U.S. trade representative and appointed Mr. Greer as his chief of s",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT President Trump repeatedly promised during his campaign that he would end the war in Ukraine in one day. But by most measures, the war has grown worse for Ukrainians since Mr. Trump returned to the White House, not better. More civilians were killed and injured in 2025 than in the previous year. More missiles and drones are hitting city centers. Russia captured more territory in its slow-moving advances in 2025 than in any year since 2022, when it launched its full-scale invasion. Moscow has practically destroyed Ukraine’s power grid during the country’s harshest winter in more than a decade. “It was a hard year — how else can you imagine it?” said Oleksandr Polishchuk, whose wife was one of 13 people killed when a missile slammed into their apartment building in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in April. “Shelling, having to go to work, dealing with household issues, no electricity, no heating. I think it was very hard, extremely hard.” After taking office in January 2025, Mr. Trump tossed out the American playbook for the war. He made overtures to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, the aggressor in the conflict and an avowed opponent of the West, while distancing the United States from Ukraine. U.S. aid to Ukraine fell by 99 percent in 2025 compared with the year before, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German research center. Mr. Trump stopped giving American weapons to Kyiv, unless it or its Western allies paid for them. Image Oleksandr Polishchuk with his daughter in April, after his wife died in a Russian missile attack in Kyiv. On top of the loss, he said he was coping with shelling and the lack of electricity and heating. Credit... Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times At the same time, Russia increased its own production of missiles, drones, shells and mines. Moscow used the weapons at a rapid clip, in part to improve its position in talks pushed by Mr. Trump, who has made no secret of his desire to be credited with ending the war. Delegations from Russia, Ukraine and the United States are scheduled to hold the next round of negotiations on Tuesday and Wednesday in Geneva. As he has moved away from a Biden administration policy of isolating Mr. Putin, Mr. Trump has succeeded in getting Russia and Ukraine to talk about settlement terms, including in face-to-face meetings in recent weeks. Mr. Trump has largely set aside traditional diplomatic principles that he said had done nothing to end the war, turning instead to negotiators he sees as seasoned deal makers. He has also imposed sanctions that have reduced the oil revenue that fuels Moscow’s war machine. But Mr. Putin has slow-walked his way through the months of negotiations, using them to buy time to continue his assault. A year into Mr. Trump’s second term and almost four years after Russia’s invasion, Mr. Putin has signaled no retreat from his goals of taking more Ukrainian territory and imposing Russian dominance. The White House did not respond to a request for comment for this article. Mr. Trump has acknowledged that the war is much harder to resolve than he thought it would be. Ukrainian officials have argued that the American president would have to take stronger action for Mr. Putin to change his thinking. Strength is a quality that Mr. Trump prizes above most others. He has asserted that Mr. Putin “respects” him in a way he did not respect previous U.S. administrations, which he says gives him leverage. Mr. Trump has said numerous times that the war never would have happened had he been president when the full invasion began in 2022. But Mr. Trump has shown a deference to Mr. Putin that has assuredly not been lost on the Kremlin leader. Mr. Trump has called his relationship with Mr. Putin “fantastic” and has repeatedly said that Mr. Putin “wants peace.” Mr. Trump has at times accepted Mr. Putin’s rewriting of history, including by blaming President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine for starting the war. Image Residential buildings amid electrical failures in Kyiv last month. Moscow has practically destroyed Ukraine’s power grid during the country’s harshest winter in more than a decade. Credit... Lynsey Addario for The New York Times Outside of occasional public criticism and the oil sanctions, Mr. Putin has largely dodged Mr. Trump’s threats. In July, Mr. Trump said he would give Russia “about 10 or 12 days ” to end the war before imposing new sanctions. Mr. Trump then announced a summit with Mr. Putin in Alaska, and the deadline passed. A month later, Mr. Trump again threatened “massive sanctions.” But he also showed reporters a photograph sent to him by Mr. Putin of the two men in Alaska and called it a sign of honor and respect . All the while, Moscow’s attacks inflicted a growing toll on Ukrainians. In 2025, Russia killed more than 2,500 Ukrainian civilians, more than in any year since 2022 and a 20 percent increase from 2024, according to United Nations statistics . Russia sent more than 53,000 long-range drones to civilian targets in Ukraine in 2025, almost five times as many as in 2024, according to a data set created by The New York Times using numbers from the Ukrainian Air Force. Moscow is also increasingly firing on city centers with ballistic missiles, which move so quickly that air-defense systems have difficulty knocking them down. Russia has launched 154 of those missiles at Ukraine this year, according to the data set, about three times the number fired during the same period last year. Got a confidential news tip?

To lead the American delegation, Mr. Trump has chosen real-estate developers with a personal connection to him. Image Kamal El Akhdar carried the coffin of his son in Ternopil, Ukraine, beside those of his wife and daughter. His family was killed in a Russian missile attack in November. Credit... Mauricio Lima for The New York Times “There are no limits for Putin, because a human dimension is not a priority of these negotiations,” Ms. Matviichuk said. “The politicians discuss natural minerals, Russia’s territorial interests, even Putin’s vision of Ukrainian history, but they don’t speak about people at all.” This month, Ms. Matviichuk, who runs an organization that shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022 for documenting war crimes by Moscow, posed a question on Facebook : “Why has Trump’s year of negotiations been the deadliest for civilians in Ukraine since the full-scale invasion?” The post received thousands of reactions. One woman alluded to Mr. Trump’s publicly stated desire for his own Nobel, asking if he would be more loyal to Ukraine if she gave her prize to him. Many Ukrainians, however, see Mr. Trump as loyal only to himself, and they have feared that in his rush to end the war, he will force an unjust peace on Ukraine. Ukraine’s European allies have said that Russia cannot be rewarded for its aggression. But a 28-point peace plan drafted late last year by American and Russian envoys looked to Ukraine like a demand for surrender. Ukrainian negotiators raced to soften its provisions, and the diplomatic dance has continued for months. Image After an August strike in Kyiv.

The authorities have moved quickly to tamp down protests or other demonstrations of anti-government sentiment to mark the occasion, with videos verified by The New York Times showing security patrols in at least two cities. Tuesday is the first of what are expected to be several days of memorial ceremonies across the country to honor the 40th day since thousands of protesters were killed from Jan. 8 to Jan. 10. The commemorations will test both of the success of the crackdown and the ability of government opponents to find new ways to defy the state. Such ceremonies have played a pivotal role in the country’s modern history: They were a staging ground for the protests that eventually overthrew Iran’s shah in 1979. This week may not be such a dramatic turning point, but dissidents are already using the occasion as a way to voice their anger at the government. Some are transforming what was once a somber, religious funeral rite into boisterous, celebratory affairs, in a stark rejection of the country’s austere rulers. Video “They’ve reinvented this with a revolutionary rage,” said Arash Azizi, a historian of Iran based in New York. “It is an attempt by Iranians to take back their country and rediscover their nationalism.” For weeks before the memorials began, security forces sought to intimidate some families into not holding public memorials, according to rights groups and relatives of several slain protesters interviewed by The New York Times. On Tuesday, videos verified by The Times showed security forces patrolling some towns, including Lesfijan in the north, where trucks filmed on the streets were loaded with troops wearing helmets and camouflage gear. Commemorations for the dead after 40 days have been at the heart of Iran’s mourning culture for generations — one of the final rituals of farewell before returning to the rhythms of daily life. The ceremonies are common among the region’s Shiite Muslims. They have pre-Islamic roots in Iran too, and are practiced by Iranians of all faiths. As a profound cultural symbol in Iran, the authorities this week appeared keen to control the memorials. The government itself announced plans for official mourning ceremonies in the capital, Tehran, and the northern city of Mashhad. “We are grieving for the blood that was shed,” the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in a speech on Tuesday. He called security forces killed in the unrest “the highest-ranking martyrs.” Bystanders and protesters who were “misled,” he said, were also martyrs. Others killed “were the very corrupters, the seditionists, and coup plotters themselves,” he said. “Their reckoning is with God. We have nothing to do with them.” Image A protest in Tehran in early January. Credit... Getty Images The government argues that it was fighting unrest during the protests that was fomented by “terrorists” backed by Israel and the United States, leading to more than 3,000 deaths. Rights groups say that vastly underestimates the toll, particularly from Jan. 8 to 10, which many now consider the bloodiest days in Iran’s modern history. Over a total of three weeks of protests, the U.S.-based rights group HRANA says more than 7,000 protesters were killed, with most killed in that three-day period. One of the victims was Robina Aminian, a 23-year-old fashion student, whose family said she was shot in the head while protesting in Tehran. Officials banned her family from public 40th-day memorials, according to her aunt, Hali Nouri, who lives in Europe. For more than a month, Ms. Nouri said, plainclothes police were stationed at either end of the alleyway where the Aminian family resides. Reaching Ms. Aminian’s grave will be particularly arduous for her family. Security forces have regularly forced families to bury dissidents in remote areas to prevent their graves from becoming a gathering point, and Ms. Aminian’s family was forced to lay her to rest in a remote, snowy village of western Iran. “My sister says, ‘Even if they shoot bullets, I will go for her 40th day,’” Ms. Nouri told The Times.

Credit... via the Aminian family There are increasing signs of dissent across Iran in the face of the continuing crackdown. At several universities, students have repeatedly attempted to hold sit-ins, according to student social media channels. And in some cities, videos showed Iranians took to their rooftops in the cover of darkness to chant for the toppling of the supreme leader. On Monday night, a small protest broke out in the southwestern town of Abdanan. In one video verified by The Times, people can be seen chanting “death to Khamenei” as passing cars honk. Video Another video , which appeared to be from Tuesday morning, shows security forces deploying in the town with armored vehicles. Another video showed large crowds screaming as they fled smoke and detonations near a cemetery in Abdanan. New displays of defiance do not necessarily mean that momentum toward a new wave of nationwide protests is building, said Farzan Sabet, an analyst on Iran and Middle East politics at the Geneva Graduate Institute in Switzerland. “What I think everyone is waiting for is whether the other shoe will drop — that is, whether a U.S. strike will happen or not.” The severity of Iran’s crackdown is also partly a reaction to threats beyond its borders. President Trump has massed warships in Persian Gulf waters, a show of force amid tenuous U.S.-Iran talks over reining in Iran’s nuclear and military capabilities. A brief round of talks was held in Geneva on Tuesday. But the risk of another regional war looms. “Almost everyone is waiting for Trump’s promises to be carried out and for foreign help to arrive,” said Masoud, an accountant in Mashhad who did not want to be identified by his full name for fear of repercussions. “The people have done everything they could.” Some Iranians said they are trying to hold 40th-day commemorations despite the restrictions. The family of the slain 17-year-old protester Mohammad Mahdi Ganj Danesh, signed pledges not to chant political slogans at their memorial, according to a family friend. Still, the authorities refused to grant them permission to hold their memorial at their mosque in the northern town of Zanjan. They, like several other families interviewed, rented an event hall instead. Video of the memorial obtained by The Times shows large crowds crammed together to celebrate his life and protest against the government. “The fallen flower has become a gift to the homeland,” they chanted and clapped. Video Instead of tearful rituals of mourning, many families of those killed at protests have transformed their commemorations with dancing, singing and clapping over people’s graves. This is seen as a way of defying traditionally somber religious customs that many Iranians now associate with the Islamic Republic’s austere rule. Video of the 40th-day ceremony for Raha Bahlooli-Pour, a student at the University of Tehran, shows mourners playing folk tunes instead of the customary recitations of Quranic verse. In the video, verified by The Times, women perform the traditional kel, a high-pitched ululation most Iranians traditionally reserve for weddings. Reimagining mourning rituals has been a part of Iran’s culture at least since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, said Mr. Azizi, the historian. At the time, Islamic revolutionaries transformed 40th-day ceremonies from somber affairs to “rabble-rousing occasions.” After an anti-gover",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of Spain said on Tuesday that his government will ask prosecutors to investigate social media giants X, Meta and TikTok for allegedly spreading child sexual abuse material generated by artificial intelligence, the latest salvo in a Europe-wide effort to regulate big tech companies. “These platforms are undermining the mental health, dignity, and rights of our children,” Mr. Sánchez wrote on social media . “The state cannot allow this. The impunity of these giants must end.” X and TikTok did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Meta declined to comment. After the French police raided the Paris offices of X in connection with similar accusations, the company said it “categorically denies any wrongdoing.” The Spanish announcement intensifies a growing dispute between European governments and American tech companies , which have been backed by the Trump administration over efforts on the continent to limit the industry. The clash has revealed starkly different visions between the United States and its tech giants and the European Union and its member states over what counts as protected speech, and the role of corporations in guaranteeing the welfare of those affected by their platforms. Europe has become a central experiment for the ability of democratic governments to regulate and effectively penalize one of the world’s most dominant industries. In December, the European Union issued the first fine under its new Digital Services Act, penalizing X, the social media platform owned by Elon Musk, for 120 million euros, about $140 million , for violations. This month, French police searched the local offices of X as part of the French cybercrime division’s own investigation into the spread of child pornography and Holocaust denial on the site. Britain’s data protection regulator has also announced an investigation into X over sexually explicit images generated by its A.I. chatbot, Grok. Ireland’s Data Protection Commission also said on Tuesday that it had opened an investigation into whether Grok had allowed pornographic images of children to spread on the platform. European leaders say their efforts are aimed at protecting citizens from abuse, rather than an attempt — as American politicians and tech leaders have argued — to limit free speech. Mr. Sánchez, a left-wing leader who has not been shy about challenging Mr. Trump or the American tech giants, asked prosecutors to “investigate the crimes that X, Meta, and TikTok may be committing through the creation and dissemination of child pornography using their AI.” This month, Spain joined France , Denmark and Australia in seeking to ban social media for children under the age of 16 , with Mr. Sánchez saying, “We will protect them from the digital Wild West.” His government’s proposed ban still requires parliamentary approval. But the proposed measure, and Mr. Sánchez referring to “crimes committed” by Grok, immediately triggered a vulgar and personally targeted attack against Mr. Sánchez by Mr. Musk. Some Spanish political analysts suggested that it was just the reaction hoped for by Mr. Sánchez, who has sought to position himself as a liberal leader on a global stage as he faces deep political divisions and scandals at home.

Feb. 17, 2026 Leer en español The square started filling well before dawn. Some revelers arrived clad in neon fishnets and doused in glitter. Others, who had been at parties elsewhere, napped on a grassy patch. The musicians came last, lugging drums and trumpets. It was Sunday morning during carnival in Rio de Janeiro, and the square in the city’s historic center was the setting for the start of a kind of roving marathon block party known as the Boi Tolo. The Boi Tolo has no set time, script or route, a swell of thousands of euphoric revelers marching through the city at a frantic pace. Those who miss the start spend the day trying to catch up, firing off messages in group chats: “Where is Boi Tolo?” Keeping pace is grueling. “Along the way, you start wondering, ‘Should I give up? I’m going to give up,’” said Lucas Fagundes, 35. “It’s like the ultimate test of your stamina.” The Boi Tolo has no set time, script or route. Few parties represent the fervor and chaos of Rio’s street carnival scene better than the Boi Tolo. Far from the glamour of official carnival parades, it has come to embody the gritty informal celebrations that take over the streets. By 6:50 a.m. on Sunday, the crowd at the square had grown to a few hundred people clad in bejeweled cowboy hats and shimmering bikinis. The musicians erupted in an improvised symphony of brass, drums and percussion instruments. A giant human chain formed around the band and everyone set off through the narrow streets, paralyzing traffic. As they passed a tram stop, a shiny Medusa blew soap bubbles toward commuters. Stilt walkers passed a bus stuck in the sea of people. One of the few rules of Boi Tolo is to keep moving. Whenever anyone stopped for an impassioned kiss, the crowd erupted: “Kiss and walk! Kiss and walk!” The direction is not always clear. “We decide the route in the moment,” said Luís Otávio Almeida, 62, one of the party’s founders. The Boi Tolo started by chance two decades ago, when a group of people arrived at a public square during carnival Sunday ready to party, but found no party, apparently misled by a newspaper announcement. One of the few rules of Boi Tolo is to keep moving. Frustrated, they decided to improvise. A beer vendor nearby had a tambourine. Someone called a friend with a drum. A lone trumpeter showed up, joining the group. Then, a reveler picked up a piece of cardboard and in lipstick scribbled “Boi Tolo,” or “foolish bull” (for their falling for the faulty announcement). The tradition stuck and it now draws tens of thousands of people each year. “Boi Tolo only exists because people want it to exist,” Mr. Almeida said. “Carnival is made on the streets. It’s made by the people.” This year’s party eventually spilled into a sprawling park, where costumed spectators hung off tree branches and squeezed under an overpass, as hundreds of people cheered above. To many “Cariocas,” as people from Rio are known, carnival is often akin to an extreme sport that requires grit and endurance. In recent years, growing numbers of visitors and searing temperatures have made it harder for even the most resilient to party hard. To try to beat the heat, Boi Tolo set out earlier than usual this year. Still, as temperatures topped 90 degrees, people fanned themselves and doused each other with water. By 11 a.m., the sun was scorching; a stilt walker in a sequin bikini crumpled to the ground. “I’m fine, my blood pressure just dropped,” she said, as she got up and started twerking again. Boi Tolo participants proceeding through a tunnel near the beach. The procession headed toward a pair of tunnels leading to Rio’s beachfront. Most participants were drenched in sweat, their makeup melting. But this is what they had been waiting for; the highlight of Boi Tolo. The beat quickened, echoing through the tunnel. The crowd burst into euphoric jubilation. “It’s magical,” said Perola Mendonça, 26. “It’s this incredible feeling of ecstasy.” On the other end, the party kept moving along the beachfront. By 4:30 p.m., the participants reached the end of the boardwalk, but they weren’t ready to stop. So they turned around and headed back toward the tunnel. After a 12-hour march through the city, a few hundred partygoers were still not ready to quit. With the light fading, they made their way back toward the city center where it all started. As they passed a stretch of beach they rushed onto the sand. A man in a cowboy hat hooked his snare drum on the crossbar of a goal post. The crowd closed in, as the musicians started playing a party anthem with lyrics the crowd could relate to. “I’m not going home! I’m not going home!” the revelers belted out, jumping up and down in the sand. Exhausted, Yasmin Santiago, 22, leaned on the goal post. She had joined a few hours earlier, not knowing what it was but eager to party. “This is Boi Tolo? No way!” Ms. Santiago said when she found out, her face lighting up. Turning to her friend, she called out: “Girl, did you hear that? We found Boi Tolo!We were looking for it for ages.” Image Some Boi Tolo revelers had waited all night for the festivities to begin. A correction was made on Feb. 17, 2026 : An earlier version of a picture caption misstated which revelers were shown. It was a group lying in the grass after waiting overnight for the festivities to begin, not exhausted participants at the end. When we learn of a mistake, we acknowledge it with a correction.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The fans next to the Olympic sliding track oohed and aahed with each sharp turn. They admired the navigational precision and soft landing. They shouted, “You’re No. 1!” They were cheering for a drone pilot. “I’m almost feeling like I am with the athletes on the tracks,” said Ralph Hogenbirk, the pilot operating one of the many drones that have become the buzzing — and, for some, unsettling — soundtrack of the 2026 Winter Olympics. The robotic wasps chase behind lugers, skeleton pilots and bobsledders bombing down the ice track in Cortina d’Ampezzo. They are in hot pursuit of alpine skiers in the mountains of Bormio and record-shattering speedskaters gliding around the rinks in Milan, transporting viewers at home to the slopes and ice. All of their unerring following has earned them a following of their own. One night last week in Cortina, a small crowd gathered outside a white tent, cordoned off between a red tractor and heaps of dirty snow, a few yards below the start gate for the skeleton race. Inside, Mr. Hogenbirk sat in a corner, a visor over his eyes, piloting his nearly nine-ounce drone. It hovered behind the skeleton athletes as they collected themselves, crept behind them as they began their mad dash to start the race and then picked up speed, whirring behind the competitors as they shot down the track’s first curves. Image A drone during the men’s moguls finals on Sunday in Livigno, Italy. Credit... Gabriela Bhaskar/The New York Times A screen in the tent showed the drone’s flight path, including when it left the track after the initial curves. It veered left and looped back over construction sites, parking lots, roped-off icy areas and into the cradled hands, red with cold, of Mr. Hogenbirk’s technician. “Very cool,” said Mary-Anne Grotheer, 33, the wife of a skeleton competitor who left the races to watch the drones come and go. Italians shouted, “Bravissimo!” and inquired about the drone’s specs. Germans appreciated its engineering. A group of British fans didn’t know what to think. “What the hell?” said Oliver Dickie, 26, a lawyer from London, as the returning drone, its green light blinking in the night, buzzed by on the way back to the tent. He said he imagined it improved the experience for spectators watching at home but wondered “how scary this would be” to be tracked by one. Athletes said not very. “I actually didn’t know they were there,” said skier Lara Markthaler, 19, of South Africa, who competed in the women’s giant slalom on Sunday. She said she had a tougher time with “the start camera like 10 centimeters from our face. That is what we do notice.” Others couldn’t wait to ski with Skynet . Image A drone following Sofia Goggia of Italy during the giant slalom competition on Sunday. Credit... James Hill for The New York Times “I saw the other competitors have drones and I was like, ‘Wow, that’s so cool, and I want to have that for my run,’” said Elin Van Pelt of Iceland, 20. She added with a laugh that having a drone follow her run for a television audience would mean, “I made it.” Drones have been used at the Olympics since the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, but have become increasingly common as the technology improves and sports audiences grow more used to up-close action. In these Games, drones are being called on to do more than ever before. Mr. Hogenbirk, a founder of the company Dutch Drone Gods, which has a background in professional drone racing, said that pilots of the drones had made sure the athletes were comfortable with them before the Games began. “Maybe they hear it a little bit, but it’s not distracting because they’re so fully focused on where they’re going,” said Mr. Hogenbirk. He said that his team had filmed each athlete before the Games, and that “everyone had a chance to say, ‘No, I don’t want this.’ None of them did.” Mr. Hogenbirk was speaking outside the tent, where he came to greet his adoring fans after his shift had ended. “People are just like filming and zooming in with their phones,” he said, adding that when the drones land people sometimes cheer, “Olympic medal!” Among the drone spectators was Kate Bentley, 26, a data analyst from Bristol, England. She was on a ski trip with friends and decided to check out the Olympics, she said, but found the skeleton athletes whooshing by her at about 90 miles per hour less than riveting. “I think skeleton could be a bit boring,” she said, “without the drones.” Jason Horowitz is the Madrid bureau chief for The Times, covering Spain, Portugal and the way people live throughout Europe.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Indirect talks between American and Iranian officials in Switzerland ended on Tuesday with an agreement on a “set of guiding principles,” according to Iran’s foreign minister, who said both sides had agreed to exchange drafts on a potential deal. The foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, was as positive as he was vague, providing little clarity on what had been discussed or when the next round of discussions might be held. American officials did not immediately comment publicly on the talks, but one U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations, said the two sides had made progress. The official said the Iranians would provide more detailed proposals in the next two weeks to address some of the gaps between the United States and Iran, but did not provide any specifics. Mr. Araghchi told Iranian state television that the talks, which were held in Geneva and lasted about three hours, had been “more constructive” and had made “good progress” compared with a previous round of negotiations in Oman this month. “We now have a clear path ahead, which in my view is positive,” he said. But Mr. Araghchi said a deal was not imminent, as the Middle East remained on edge over the possibility of an American attack should negotiations collapse. Iran has insisted that the talks be strictly limited to its nuclear program, even as U.S. officials have said they would push to curb the range of Iran’s ballistic missiles and its support of militias across the region. Mr. Araghchi did not address those points in his comments to Iranian state television, saying only that the two sides had reached a “general understanding on a set of guiding principles” to continue discussions and to “move toward drafting the text of a possible agreement.” “This does not mean that we can reach an agreement quickly, but at least the path has begun,” he said. Three Iranian officials familiar with the talks said that Iran had indicated a willingness to suspend nuclear enrichment for three to five years — which would cover the duration of Mr. Trump’s presidency — and then join a regional consortium for civilian grade enrichment. Iran would also dilute its stockpile of uranium on its own soil in the presence of international inspectors. In exchange, Iran has demanded that the United States lift financial and banking sanctions and the embargo on its oil sales. The officials, who asked not to be identified to discuss sensitive negotiations, said Iran was also dangling financial incentives and opportunities for investments and trade with the United States, including in Iran’s oil and energy sectors. The negotiations were hosted at the Omani ambassador’s residence by Oman’s foreign minister, Badr Albusaidi, who mediated the previous round of talks. A spokesman for Iran’s foreign ministry said ahead of the talks that Omani officials would shuttle between the two sides. Mr. Albusaidi said on social media after the talks that they had concluded “with good progress towards identifying common goals and relevant technical issues.” “Together we made serious efforts to define a number of guiding principles for a final deal,” he added. “Much work is yet to be done.” Steve Witkoff, the Middle East envoy, and Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law, had been expected to attend the negotiations, according to two U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy. Mr. Trump, speaking on Monday on Air Force One, said he would be involved in the talks “indirectly” and that they would be “very important.” He said Iran wanted to make a deal. The American president has ordered a buildup of U.S. forces in the region — including two aircraft carriers — after vowing last month to aid antigovernment demonstrators in Iran. The Iranian government quelled those protests in a bloody crackdown that killed thousands, according to rights groups. Now, Mr. Trump is calling on Iran to reach a deal to limit its nuclear and military capabilities or face a possible attack. Last week, he wrote on social media that he preferred a deal with Iran, but that if one could not be brokered, “we will just have to see what the outcome will be.” Countries in the region worry that a potential American strike, and an Iranian retaliation that could draw in Israel, could destabilize the Middle East and endanger U.S. allies in the Arab world that host American soldiers. In a speech on Tuesday shortly after the talks began, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, responded defiantly to Mr. Trump’s orders to send a second aircraft carrier to the region. “An aircraft carrier is certainly a dangerous piece of equipment,” the ayatollah said. “But more dangerous than the carrier is the weapon that can send it to the bottom of the sea.” He also called demands to limit the range of Iran’s ballistic missiles “illogical,” arguing that such demands interfered with his nation’s right to possess weapons of self-defense. “Any country without deterrent weapons will be crushed under the feet of its enemies,” he said. On Tuesday, Iranian naval forces closed parts of the Strait of Hormuz, a key global shipping lane, for several hours to conduct a second day of naval “war games,” according to the semiofficial Tasnim news agency. The Iranian government is under considerable pressure to agree to a deal. Iran’s economy has struggled under crippling international sanctions, which helped ignite the latest wave of protests against the country’s authoritarian government. Iranian officials have argued they will not make concessions on nuclear enrichment without sanctions relief. Iran’s deputy foreign minister told state media that in return Tehran could offer Washington lucrative investment opportunities in sectors like oil, gas and mining. Last year, U.S. and Iranian officials tried to negotiate a nuclear deal that would end the sanctions, but Israel launched a military campaign against the Iranian nuclear program as the talks were underway, leading to a 12-day war between the two countries. U.S. stealth bombers joined the Israeli assault, attacking three Iranian nuclear sites. Mr. Trump initially said that the U.S. bombing had obliterated Iran’s nuclear program, but American intelligence later said that it had been badly damaged , not destroyed. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who met with Mr. Trump last week in Washington, said on Sunday that the American president believed that Iran “must surely understand that they missed out last time” by not showing more flexibility in the 2025 talks. “He thinks there is a serious probability that they won’t miss out this time,” Mr. Netanyahu told a group of American Jewish leaders in Jerusalem, although he added that he was far more skeptical of “any deal with Iran.” Tyler Pager contributed reporting from Washington, and Farnaz Fassihi from New York.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT A senior official for Gaza on President Trump’s “Board of Peace” met with a top Hamas leader last week and pressed the militant group on the issue of disarmament, according to two officials briefed on the encounter, amid concern that Israel may return to war. The direct talks between Nickolay Mladenov, a former United Nations envoy serving as the board’s “high representative” for Gaza, and Khalil al-Hayya, the chief Hamas negotiator, underscored that the group remains a key actor in Gaza’s postwar transition. The board, a new international body with a mandate to secure peace in conflict zones, is set to have its inaugural meeting in Washington on Thursday. Officials from the board are finalizing a demilitarization plan that they hope will be acceptable to both Israel and Hamas, allowing the group to keep some small arms , at least initially. Yet Mr. al-Hayya refused to discuss demilitarization with Mr. Mladenov, the officials said, during their meeting in Cairo. It was unclear why he did not engage on the subject. In an interview with Al Jazeera that aired on Dec. 10, Khaled Meshal, a Qatar-based Hamas leader, said that to take away weapons from Palestinians was to take away their soul. Mr. Trump’s 20-point peace plan , which paved the way for the October cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, calls on the group to give up its weapons, but members of its leadership have not publicly agreed to that demand. On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested that if Hamas failed to give up its weapons, Israel would refuse to move to the next phase of the cease-fire. That phase is widely expected to involve Israel further withdrawing its forces from Gaza and facilitating efforts for reconstruction in the territory. “Hamas must first be disarmed and then Gaza must be demilitarized,” Mr. Netanyahu told a conference in Jerusalem, adding that the group still holds 60,000 Kalashnikov assault rifles. Yossi Fuchs, the Israeli government’s cabinet secretary, said on Monday that if Hamas does not disarm, the military will need to return to “complete the mission” in Gaza. In the past, talks between Hamas and the United States have mostly been conducted through Qatari and Egyptian mediators. The direct talks suggest that Board of Peace officials are urgently pushing for a breakthrough on demilitarization. A representative for Mr. Mladenov did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Hamas’s media office. Mr. Mladenov was asked on Friday about demilitarization while speaking at the Munich Security Conference and said, “The reality is that all of this needs to move very fast.” He went on to say there was a risk the cease-fire could collapse, leading to a return to war.

Evan Vucci/Associated Press For Hamas, armed struggle against Israel is a core part of its ideology, and even discussing demilitarization has caused fissures among the group. Despite the apparent deadlock, Mr. Trump has projected optimism about the Board of Peace’s efforts in Gaza. Writing on social media on Sunday, he said that member states had pledged more than $5 billion toward “Humanitarian and Reconstruction efforts” and committed thousands of troops “to maintain Security and Peace for Gazans.” Senior officials from board member states are expected to announce pledges at the inaugural meeting later this week and discuss the humanitarian situation in Gaza. More than 20 countries have so far joined the board. Some European countries have expressed reservations about the board’s mandate, which extends to conflicts beyond Gaza, and U.S. allies including the United Kingdom and Germany have declined an invitation to join. Analysts have cautioned that the president may be attempting to establish a rival to the United Nations, with himself at the helm. Aaron Boxerman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Dressed all in black with her dark hair pulled tightly into a bun, the Russian teenager many in the figure skating world have been wondering about finally showed up in Milan on Monday. A day before she began competition at the Winter Olympics, the young woman, 18-year-old Adeliia Petrosian, practiced for the first time at the official training rink. A swarm of camera lenses followed her as she glided across the ice. She landed jump after jump, easily turning her 5-foot body into a tiny rotating rocket. Afterward, she scurried past reporters, stopping only long enough to say in Russian, “Mood is excellent!” As the Olympic women’s figure skating competition begins on Tuesday, Petrosian is a contender for the gold medal — under the cloud of the biggest doping scandal in her sport’s history. Yet she is relatively unknown outside Russia because the country’s athletes were barred from international competition in 2022 over its invasion of Ukraine. The Winter Games will be just her second senior-level event outside Russia since then. “I can tell you that none of us have any idea how she will do, and she doesn’t have any idea, either,” said Adam Rippon, who won Olympic bronze for the United States in 2018 and coached at the 2022 Beijing Games. “But it’s kind of sad to think about that, if she does win a medal, how that will reflect on the sport.” Petrosian has the résumé of a potential medalist: Three-time and reigning Russian women’s national champion. A history of landing quadruple jumps, the hardest in skating. A coach who churns out Olympic champions, including Russians who have won gold at the last three Winter Games. But that coach was also at the center of scandal four years ago , when one of her charges, the 15-year-old Russian skater Kamila Valieva, failed a drug test and threw the Beijing Olympics into chaos. Valieva, one of Petrosian’s training mates, tested positive for the heart medication trimetazidine, which is banned because it is thought to increase stamina and endurance. She claimed that her grandfather had accidentally contaminated her strawberry dessert with his medication. Her failed drug test led to Russia being stripped of the team gold medal, and she served a four-year ban for doping. Even though Valieva was underage at the time, the rest of her team — including her coach, Eteri Tutberidze, and her choreographer, Daniil Gleikhengauz — were spared punishment. Image Eteri Tutberidze, right, and Daniil Gleikhengauz, who is listed as Petrosian’s official coach at the Olympics. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times There is no record of Petrosian testing positive and she has not been implicated in doping. But she and Valieva shared the same coaches, choreographer and training site in Moscow, where, according to findings by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, a medical team administered 56 different medications and dietary supplements to Valieva over two years, starting when she was 13. Now Petrosian is carrying the hopes of her country, one that is eager to re-enter the Olympic fold and rebound from a series of sanctions that have been imposed on it since the revelation of a government-sponsored doping scheme at the 2014 Winter Games. She is the sole Russian skater in the women’s event, but she isn’t officially representing her country. She is competing as a “neutral athlete,” like 13 other Russians at the Games. Though some international sports federations stood by their bans on Russian athletes for the Olympics in Italy, the International Skating Union, figure skating’s governing body, allowed two Russians to compete as neutrals: Petrosian and Petr Gumennik, who finished sixth in the men’s event last week. Last September, Petrosian won an Olympic qualifying event in Beijing, her international debut as a senior-level skater. Her choreographer, Gleikhengauz, was barred from that event for failing to pass the I.S.U. screening for neutrality, which means that it found indications that he supported the invasion of Ukraine, according to a person with knowledge of the ban who was not authorized to speak on behalf of the federation. Tutberidze did not apply to be Petrosian’s coach at that event or at the Olympics, the person said. An International Olympic Committee panel subsequently cleared Petrosian and Gleikhengauz to participate in the Milan-Cortina Games, where he is her official coach, according to the I.O.C. The organization did not immediately return a request for comment about why it cleared Gleikhengauz to coach in Milan after the I.S.U. had not cleared him for the qualifying event. Madison Chock and Evan Bates, the U.S. ice dancing team that won silver in Milan last week, were not awarded their gold medal for the team event in 2022 until the Summer Games two years later because Valieva’s doping case dragged on so long. But Bates said he supported the inclusion of Russian athletes at these Olympics. “In the spirit of the Games and fair play, I think there should be, in some regard, an avenue for those kinds of athletes,” he said. Still, skepticism surrounds Petrosian’s participation. Before she entered the Olympic drug-testing pool last May, the Russian antidoping agency was responsible for testing her for performance-enhancing drugs, the international skating federation said. But the World Anti-Doping Agency, the global body charged with ensuring fair competition in Olympic sports, does not recognize the Russian agency because it has failed to follow WADA rules. Image Adeliia Petrosian at the Russian Figure Skating Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, last year. Credit... Anton Vaganov/Reuters Since last May, Petrosian also has been drug tested by the International Testing Agency, which was formed after Russia’s state-sponsored cheating program was uncovered and is also responsible for testing athletes during the Games, the I.S.U. said. But some experts say questions around Petrosian and some other Russian athletes remain because the effects of doping can last years. “Russia remains noncompliant with WADA rules for its state-sponsored doping, but their athletes get waived through to the Games?” said Travis Tygart, chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency. “It’s exactly why athletes, fans and sponsors have lost confidence.” Tutberidze, a dual citizen of Russia and Georgia, is officially the coach of a male Georgian skater in Milan. But she was at the practice rink on Monday when Petrosian skated, looking very much like her coach. Witold Banka, the president of WADA, said that there was no legal basis to bar Tutberidze from coaching in Milan because an investigation into Valieva’s entourage found no proof of wrongdoing. But he added: “I don’t feel comfortable with her presence here.” Tutberidze, who ignored several interview requests, has a reputation for pushing young skaters so hard that they burn out early and sustain injuries, and for berating Valieva on live television four years ago. Entangled in the doping scandal, Valieva stumbled through her long program at the Beijing Games and finished in tears. Television cameras captured the moments afterward, when a grim-faced Tutberidze offered the teen scathing words. “Why did you stop fighting?” she said. Thomas Bach, the I.O.C. president at the time, said he was “very, very disturbed” to see Valieva being treated with “such coldness.” Image Kamila Valieva with her coach, Tutberidze, before her performance at the 2022 Beijing Olympics. Credit... Chang W. Lee/The New York Times In interviews and on social media, Petrosian has had nothing but praise for her coaches. She and Gleikhengauz were featured in a recent Russian edition of Marie Claire magazine, in which they discussed fashion — Petrosian’s style trends toward that of Audrey Hepburn and of Zendaya — and the importance of trust between an athlete and coach. Petrosian said she had dreamed of training with Tutberidze and her staff before she joined them at about age 12, and that",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT A judge in New Zealand who discovered last week that apology letters from a defendant in an arson case had been written with the help of artificial intelligence raised questions about the sincerity of her sentiments. “The issue of remorse is interesting,” said the judge, Tom Gilbert, of the district court in Christchurch, as he mulled the punishment of a woman who had pleaded guilty to arson and other charges. Remorse can be a mitigating factor in sentencing. Her letters to the victims and the court were nicely written, the judge said. He decided to do some sleuthing. “Out of curiosity I punched into two A.I. tools ‘draft me a letter for a judge expressing remorse for my offending,’” the judge said, according to a transcript of the sentencing hearing that was shared with The New York Times. “It became immediately apparent that these were two A.I.-generated letters, albeit with tweaks around the edges.” The case illustrates a global debate about using machines for meaningful communication. Judge Gilbert said he was not criticizing the defendant’s use of A.I. “But certainly when one is considering the genuineness of an individual’s remorse, simply producing a computer-generated letter does not really take me anywhere as far as I am concerned,” he said, according to the transcript. The judge was not alone in wrestling with the question of authenticity in A.I.-assisted writing in the case before him, which was initially reported by The New Zealand Herald . Increasingly, people are outsourcing many tasks to machines, including writing apologies , eulogies and wedding vows , perhaps saving precious time but also inviting the ire of some of their fellow humans. Growing reliance on A.I. has led some cultural commentators to bemoan “ the rise of the LLeMmings,” people who depend on large language models known as LLMs to aid much of their thinking and production, including in their personal lives . Social scientists say the questions raised by use of these tools go beyond etiquette. “It’s a mirror into who we are and what we care about as humans,” Jim A.C. Everett, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Kent in Britain, said in an email about the case in New Zealand and his own work on what is described as the “outsourcing penalty.” Dr. Everett worked on a series of recent studies on the perception of A.I. use and users. Generative A.I. tools like ChatGPT are promoted as time savers that produce better work faster, experts say. But people apparently believe that certain activities should take work in order to seem genuine, and more personal A.I.-generated efforts are received particularly poorly, his research suggests. Across the six studies Dr. Everett worked on, 4,000 participants were asked about 20 tasks — including writing computer code, concocting recipes and drafting love letters and apologies. The aim was to understand how people perceive those who use A.I. and how that perception might shift depending on the activity and the way the tools were used. “A.I. is a tool for efficiency, and it can be helpful, but it also typically involves, and signals, reduced effort,” Dr. Everett said. But the use of such tools acts as a kind of proxy for character traits, the researchers found. The findings, published in the journal Computers in Human Behavior , suggest that people generally perceived those using A.I. as lazier, less competent and less trustworthy, and their work as less meaningful and authentic. “When you spend time crafting a piece of writing or completing a task yourself, others can assume that message reflects your priorities: that what you write is authentically yours and represents what you care about,” Dr. Everett said. The situation in the New Zealand courtroom was a real-life test of the sentiments and perceptions that he and his fellow researchers sought to identify and understand. “An A.I. could be perfectly trained on all apologies that a person has ever written, but one might still think that a specific apology it then generates in a new instance is not an authentic apology because it does not come from the kind of processes deemed important in an apology: a personal recollection of the wrong, a commitment to change,” the study said. The study detected a difference in how people perceived using A.I. for social tasks, like writing a love letter, versus a practical tasks, like writing computer code. The more personal a task the more negative was their impression. Judge Gilbert ultimately said he was willing to give the defendant some credit for genuine remorse, looking beyond the letters. But he granted only a 5 percent reduction in the sentence instead of the 10 percent the defense lawyer had requested based on the defendant’s remorse. “I do not consider this is a case where 10 percent is justified and, indeed, 5 percent might be viewed as reasonably generous,” Judge Gilbert concluded. In the end, he sentenced the defendant to 27 months in prison. Ephrat Livni is a Times reporter covering breaking news around the world. She is based in Washington.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Belgium’s government summoned President Trump’s ambassador after he accused his host nation of an antisemitic action and criticized a Belgian official in a series of posts on social media. The meeting on Tuesday between the ambassador, Bill White, and a representative from Belgium’s foreign office came at a moment of heightened tension as the Trump administration paints governments across Europe as out of line with American values. Mr. White criticized Belgium on Monday on social media over an investigation in Antwerp into a few Jewish mohels who perform ritual circumcision, and who the authorities say may be carrying out procedures without medical training . Mr. White wrote on X that Belgium should drop what he called a “RIDICULOUS AND ANTI SEMITIC ‘PROSECUTION.’” He tagged Mr. Trump and the American vice president and the secretary of state, among others. “You must make a legal provision to allow Jewish religious MOHELS to perform their duties here in Belgium,” Mr. White added, addressing the Belgian health minister. Circumcision is far less common in Europe than in the United States and Israel and different countries regulate it in different ways. In Belgium, laws mandate that all medical procedures must be performed by a licensed doctor, said Arne Brinckman, a representative for Belgium’s health minister. The Antwerp public prosecutor’s office put out a news release about the case in May and confirmed on Tuesday that the investigation was continuing. Kristof Aerts, a representative for the office, did not elaborate but noted that there were no “ongoing prosecutions.” Maxime Prévot, Belgium’s foreign minister, responded at length to Mr. White on X, saying that “personal attacks against a Belgian minister and interference in judicial matters violate basic diplomatic norms.” “Any suggestion that Belgium is antisemitic is false, offensive, and unacceptable,” Mr. Prévot wrote in the post, on Monday evening. A statement from the Belgian foreign ministry after the meeting — which included Mr. White and Theodora Gentzis, the secretary general of the Belgian foreign ministry — underlined its stance. Mr. Prévot was not present because he is traveling, Mr. White said and Mr. Prévot’s office confirmed. “Belgium attaches great importance to its relations with the United States of America. This partnership remains essential and we remain open to dialogue,” the statement said. “However, this dialogue must be based on respect for our institutions and our sovereignty.” On Tuesday morning, Gideon Sa’ar, Israel’s foreign minister, also weighed in on social media. “I understand that the mirror Ambassador @BillWhiteUSA has held up to you is unpleasant, but one might want to take this opportunity to take a hard look in that mirror and acknowledge reality,” he wrote. Mr. White said in an interview that he does not think Belgium is antisemitic. He said he had previously held private conversations about the issue with Belgian officials, and was frustrated by the slow progress. He said that he does not want the government to interfere in the judicial system by forcing it to drop the case, but that he would like government officials to speak in support of the men under investigation. Most governments in Europe and other democracies avoid becoming involved in their judicial systems, out of deference to judicial independence. Mr. White noted that Charles Kushner, Mr. Trump’s ambassador to France, faced a similar summons last year after complaining about what Mr. Kushner characterized as France’s failure to stem antisemitism in a letter to President Emmanuel Macron. The French foreign ministry denied the accusations. Mr. White said his own meeting with the foreign ministry was “very nice.” “I did not apologize for anything,” Mr. White said. “Nor would I.” Jeanna Smialek is the Brussels bureau chief for The Times.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Palmerston, a cat who served as the “chief mouser” for Britain’s diplomatic service, has died in Bermuda. He was about 12. “Palmerston, Diplocat extraordinaire, passed away peacefully,” his social media account announced on Friday , a day after he died. “He was a wonderful companion, with a gentle nature, and will be sorely missed.” “Farewell Palmerston, with love and thanks,” the Foreign Office wrote in a separate tribute on social media, acknowledging his work as a “feline diplomat.” Palmerston was born in 2013, according to the Foreign Office, and was named after Lord Palmerston, the 19th-century foreign secretary and two-time prime minister. The cat was adopted in 2016 from the Battersea Cats and Dogs Home, an animal rescue center in London, after he had spent a rough time on the streets: “He was hungry, underweight and had no microchip,” the BBC reported . He was initially tasked with dealing with mice in the Foreign Office’s Victorian-era headquarters in London, one of the British government’s grandest buildings. But he became a social media star, eventually amassing almost 100,000 followers on X — more than many British ambassadors have. He even dressed for the part. Famously, he never took off his tuxedo. A few months after Palmerston was adopted, Britain voted to leave the European Union, a decision that led to a period of political turmoil. On the ground, Palmerston kept calm and carried on catching mice. On social media, he was a friendly face for the country through his regular updates. During the coronavirus pandemic, Palmerston was eventually moved out of central London and formally retired to the countryside in 2020, with Andrew Murdoch, who worked in the Foreign Office alongside the cat. In Palmerston’s farewell letter to Simon McDonald, then the top civil servant at the Foreign Office, Palmerston revealed himself to be a master diplomat or even spy by admitting to “pretending to be asleep while overhearing all the foreign dignitaries’ conversations.” Last February, Palmerston wrote on X that he had come out of retirement to take up a new posting as a “feline relations consultant” in Bermuda with Mr. Murdoch. It was a good gig for an aging cat. Palmerston described his work as “feline relations consultant (semi-retired).” There, he “gave audiences to visitors between well-deserved naps,” the office of the governor said on social media . Many will miss him. But perhaps no one understood him better than Larry the Cat , the chief mouser at No. 10 Downing Street, the prime minister’s official residence, who has almost 900,000 followers on social media. At first, the two did not get along. Video footage taken soon after Palmerston arrived at the Foreign Office showed the cats in the sort of heated confrontation more commonly seen between politicians than civil servants. Larry was once spotted with a limp after reports that Palmerston had clawed him. But the two appeared to have repaired their relationship after Palmerston moved out of London. Last week, Larry joined the nation in mourning his old rival after a life of service for Queen, King and country. “Farewell old friend,” he wrote on social media.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Ukrainian and Russian officials began a new round of U.S.-brokered peace talks on Tuesday in Switzerland, though hopes of a breakthrough to end the war were low. Fighting rages on, past negotiations have produced little, and major hurdles to a deal are unresolved. The talks, which were held Tuesday afternoon and will run through Wednesday, were the third trilateral meeting between Ukrainian, Russian and American negotiators in roughly three weeks. Ukraine and Russia have described two previous rounds of discussions in the United Arab Emirates as productive. But those talks delivered scant progress beyond a prisoner-of-war exchange. The conflict will enter its fifth year later this month as Russia continues to strike Ukraine’s power grid , including in an attack on Tuesday involving nearly 40 missiles and 400 drones, according to the Ukrainian Air Force . Kyiv and Moscow are still far apart on the core obstacles to a peace deal: the fate of Ukrainian-held territory in the east that Russia wants — an issue expected to dominate this week’s talks — and the question of postwar Western security guarantees to deter another Russian invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine underscored those differences in social media posts on Monday, warning that it would be “a big mistake to allow the aggressor to take something” — an apparent reference to Russia’s demand for the eastern territories. He also urged the United States to advance work on security guarantees, which has been complicated by Moscow’s insistence that such guarantees must exclude Western troop deployments in Ukraine. Rustem Umerov, the head of the Ukrainian delegation and the secretary of the country’s National Security Council, published pictures on social media that showed him seated at a table with other Ukrainian officials, including Kyrylo Budanov , Mr. Zelensky’s chief of staff. To their right, according to the pictures, sat American mediators, including Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s special envoy; and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law. Both had just wrapped up talks focused on Iran that were also held in Geneva. Facing the Ukrainians was the Russian delegation, which included Vladimir Medinsky, a top Kremlin aide, as well as military intelligence figures, according to the pictures. The presence of Mr. Medinsky, a former culture minister and amateur historian who led negotiations for Moscow last year , has been seen by some in Ukraine as a discouraging signal. In previous talks, Mr. Medinsky grated on his Ukrainian counterparts with lengthy historical lectures and a hard-line stance, warning that Russia was prepared to keep fighting indefinitely. Image From right, President Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, the president’s special envoy, in Paris last month. Credit... Michel Euler/Associated Press Mr. Medinsky was absent from the two trilateral meetings this year in the United Arab Emirates, where Russia was represented by security and military intelligence officials — a shift that Ukrainian officials said helped improve the tone of the talks. “These are different people, and there were no more pseudohistorical lectures,” Andrii Sybiha, Ukraine’s foreign minister, told Ukrainian media last month after the first trilateral meeting. “The conversations were very focused.” Those meetings focused on the mechanics of a cease-fire and how it would be monitored by the United States, Mr. Zelensky told Bloomberg last week. They did not appear to address the bigger sticking points related to territorial issues and security guarantees — which analysts said may explain why the talks were described as constructive . Mr. Zelensky told Bloomberg that this week’s negotiations would most likely center on the territorial issue. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, confirmed as much on Monday in a call with reporters, adding that the change in focus had prompted the return of Mr. Medinsky as “the chief negotiator.” Officials from Britain, France, Germany and Italy also took part in Tuesday’s talks, though they were not expected to engage with the Russian delegation, according to a Kyiv-based European diplomat. European countries have largely been sidelined in the peace negotiations, even though the war is unfolding on their continent. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has insisted that the war would not end unless Ukraine cedes the portion of the eastern Donetsk region it still controls — roughly 2,000 square miles of land, about the size of Delaware. Mr. Zelensky has repeatedly said Russia’s territorial demand was a nonstarter. But he has signaled openness to compromise, suggesting a demilitarized zone in Donetsk where both Ukrainian and Russian troops would pull back from an equal portion of territory. Polls in Ukraine also show a growing acceptance of territorial concessions among a war-weary public. Russia has long asserted that its slow but steady advance on the battlefield means Ukraine would be better off agreeing to a deal that includes territorial concessions now, rather than having Kyiv lose land later in bloody fighting. Ukraine, by contrast, has sought to maximize the cost of Russia’s advance by inflicting as many casualties on its troops as possible. Counterattacks over the past week have allowed Ukrainian troops to regain some positions in the east along the Haichul River, which serves as a natural barrier to Russian advances, according to battlefield maps and military analysts. But Ukrainian officials said this month that the Trump administration was ramping up pressure on them to make concessions, in a push to end the war by early summer .

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Prosecutors in Austria said on Monday that they had filed terrorism and other charges against a 21-year-old man they said was a member of a terrorist group that was planning an attack on a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna in 2024. The suspect, who was not publicly identified, professed his allegiance to the Islamic State group online, prosecutors said. The attack was thwarted but worries over safety led to the cancellation of three shows the artist had planned in Austria. The main aim was to attack the concert, according to prosecutors, who also accused the man of downloading instructions from ISIS for a shrapnel bomb “specifically designed” for terror attacks. The suspect was charged with receiving instructions on handling and using the materials, the Vienna Public Prosecutor’s Office said . The man is also accused of having repeatedly tried to buy firearms and a hand grenade, and instructing illegal dealers to import the weapons into Austria. The suspect, who has been in custody since August 2024, faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted, prosecutors said. The initial tip about a threat against Ms. Swift’s concerts came from American intelligence , Austrian officials have said. The shows were part of Ms. Swift’s Eras tour, and had been expected to draw tens of thousands of fans. The threat followed deadly attacks on concert halls. In 2015, an ISIS attack on a Paris concert hall and other sites killed 130 people , and in 2017, an attack on an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, killed at least 22 people . The bomber in the Manchester attack, who died in the assault, had links to ISIS . Prosecutors in Germany last year charged a Syrian teenager living in Germany with helping plot the thwarted Vienna concert attack. In that case, prosecutors accused the teenager, whom they identified only as Mohammad A. in keeping with privacy rules, of helping interpret Arabic-language bomb-building instructions and of translating an oath of allegiance to ISIS for the main suspect in the Austria plot. The teen was about 14 years old when the plot was thwarted, and he was convicted and given an 18-month suspended sentence under juvenile criminal law. Christopher F. Schuetze contributed reporting.

      "content": "The Syrian Army has moved into vast new regions, seeking to erase the largest fissure left from the civil war. They have encountered a land in desperate need and deeply divided after years of fighting. The advance has left ethnic Kurds fearful and wary. It has dashed their dream of autonomy in northeastern Syria. Their lingering defiance may point to challenges ahead. The mood was tense as government forces entered the city of Hasakah in northeastern Syria this month. U.S.-led coalition warplanes flew overhead, and a Syrian Army unit monitored the column’s progress from drones, watching for ambush by Kurdish groups. It was the first time the government was moving into Hasakah, a stronghold of the Kurds for more than a decade, and its presence was not welcomed by all. Kurdish soldiers, who are being made to abandon their ambition for an autonomous region, remained defiant, parading with Kurdish flags and weapons before a government base. The display indicated the challenges ahead for President Ahmed al-Sharaa. Benefiting from a switch in American support away from the Kurds, he has used a mixture of muscle and negotiation in recent weeks to take over three provinces of eastern Syria. The vast, resource-rich region had eluded his grasp since his rebel force toppled the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad just over a year ago. His new government is now extending its authority, advancing toward its goal of unifying Syria for the first time in 15 years. The task before him is daunting. Already stretched with stabilizing the war-battered country and lifting its people out of poverty, the government now has a huge new area of territory to secure and rebuild.

During a two-week long journey across the newly opened territory, our reporting team encountered a land in desperate need and deeply divided after years of civil conflict. The Kurds, a minority in Syria, are the dominant population in parts of northeast Syria, and they were by turns wary, resistant and resigned at the prospect of rule from Damascus. Arab residents, who had chafed under the rule of the Kurdish-led force, the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., were celebratory. Some had rushed back to reclaim their homes, even as army units were clearing mines and booby traps left by departing Kurdish forces. “The entire village was displaced in 2013,” said Ahmed al-Ahmad, 40, who had returned from Lebanon and was repairing his house in the village of Al Belasha, in the newly controlled areas of Aleppo province. “Not even a bird could fly here.” The infrastructure demands are immense. The area’s hydroelectric dams, oil fields and rich farming land are debilitated. Much of the countryside lies in darkness. Cities are strewed with trash. Power is so intermittent that neighborhoods roar with the sound of generators. In the provincial capital of Raqqa, cars bumped through potholes filled with muddy rainwater. Others lined up to navigate a broken ramp onto the main bridge across the Euphrates River that had been blown up by retreating S.D.F. forces. Video Crossing the Euphrates River by boat in Raqqa.

Security forces were still searching underground tunnels for explosives and S.D.F. stragglers, said Ahmed Adel, the acting head of the government’s Internal Security forces in Raqqa. “Once we have security,” Mr. Adel said, “we can sort out everything else.” Government officials said they have learned from the experience of taking over the rest of the country after the fall of the Assad regime in December 2024.

Government delegations have been arriving from Damascus to assess the region’s needs, but residents are already complaining about rising gas prices. With the departure of the S.D.F., thousands who had built an economy linked to the force and its administration were now without jobs. In northeastern Syria, the S.D.F. was more than a fighting force but a veritable government of its own. It had been the main ally working with U.S. forces in the area for more than a decade in combating the terrorist group Islamic State and guarding thousands of ISIS prisoners. The Kurds had long wanted their own autonomous region there. But in recent weeks, the Trump administration withdrew its support from the Kurds and threw it behind Mr. al-Sharaa in his aim to unite Syria under his rule. Some Kurds saw the shift as a betrayal. Without American backing, the Kurdish force could not hold their neighborhoods in the city of Aleppo, and had little hope of controlling the mainly Arab populated provinces of Raqqa and Deir al Zour. Some Kurdish fighters in Aleppo chose to make a last stand. After days of fighting, the bulk of the fighters and their political leaders withdrew to Hasakah, a largely Kurdish region. The government has now entered there, too. Image Mines collected from recently captured territory, near the Tishreen Dam.

Image Billboards honoring Kurdish fighters killed during the battle for the Sheikh Maqsoud neighborhood in Aleppo and leaders of the Kurdish struggle across the region. People living in the mainly Arab populated provinces wrested from the S.D.F. complained that the Kurdish-led force had run a harsh police state. “We were always in fear they would raid our shop. We knew anyone could charge us with being an ISIS fighter,” said Belal Bargash, 32, standing outside his cellphone shop in a part of Deir al Zour province that had been controlled by the Kurdish-led force. “We feel extremely relieved,” he said, breaking into a beaming smile. Some Kurds in the region said that they, too, had felt oppressed by the S.D.F.’s administration. Ayman Lolak, 43, a Kurdish businessman in the Sheikh Maqsoud neighborhood of Aleppo, which the S.D.F. had lost, said he was pleased finally to be reconnected to the rest of the city and to the central government. He said the Kurdish administration had confiscated his line of shops and other properties near the front line and allowed him only the use of one shop and one house. “We were under a blockade for the last year,” he said. “Now it’s open and we can import and export goods.” Image Local residents on the formerly S.D.F.-controlled side of the Euphrates River, opposite Deir al Zour.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Just about everyone close to Tshephiso Marumo condemned her when she chose to sell ears of corn door-to-door a decade ago after earning an honors degree from a university in her native Botswana. It was the sort of thing that people in the southern African nation looked down upon as poor people’s work, not something for a sophisticated graduate with dreams of becoming a journalist. One of her former professors was so dismayed that he derisively nicknamed her Mmammidi, a Setswana term that roughly translates to Corn Lady. Ms. Marumo, 33, shrugged off the criticism and has since turned that humble beginning into what many people in Botswana call a tale of triumph and inspiration: She has opened two roadside food stalls in the capital, Gaborone, that have become a hit, selling traditional village cooking that you almost never find in urban areas. Her venture has turned the unglamorous work of roadside food vending into something fashionable, earning her a large social media following and prominent customers, including politicians, musicians and influencers. Video Food being prepared in Ms. Marumo’s backyard. Yet the same qualities that have aided Ms. Marumo’s rise — persistence, candor and stubbornness — have also made her a divisive figure. The more prominent she has become, the louder she has spoken out online about hot-button issues, like parenting and drug addiction, earning her a reputation among some as a social media bully. On Facebook , one of Botswana’s primary social media platforms, Ms. Marumo has more than 240,000 followers, the equivalent of nearly 10 percent of Botswana’s population. She called the business Mmammidi, after the former professor’s nickname, and plastered it onto T-shirts, aprons and two company cars. “There are so many things I have done, but they have never given me a brand or a name or an identity,” she said. “But through the corn, I got an identity.” Ms. Marumo likes to say she sparked controversy even before she was born. Her mother became pregnant with her as a teenager, upsetting many family members. Growing up, Ms. Marumo bounced between Gaborone, where her mother worked as a police officer, and Kalamare, a village three hours away where she stayed with her grandmother. Her grandmother ran an illegal tavern out of their home, something that was frowned upon in the community. But Ms. Marumo said she had no shame in the family business because she was always well taken care of. Her grandmother taught her how to cook, and that interest grew when she took home economics in school. Image Ms. Marumo makes traditional food, including a shredded beef dish known as seswaa and bogobe jwa lerotse, a thick porridge of sorghum and melon juice. Ms. Marumo started her cooking business after building a following with her corn sales. She began hosting dinners at her home, cooking Tswana food in the traditional style — in three-legged cast iron pots over a wood-fired flame. The dishes are seasoned mostly with just salt and natural fats, a traditional technique meant to bring out the true flavors of the meats, starches and vegetables. Her dinners became so popular, she said, that in late 2019 she cleared out a bushy field at a busy intersection near her home and set up her first food stall. Offering village cooking on a street corner near Gaborone’s central business district, Ms. Marumo’s enterprise was a welcome departure for many locals from the usual fare of westernized food showered in spices served up by chain restaurants. “I’m passionate about my heritage, where I’m from and what my ancestors consumed before me,” a satisfied Orebotse Makgolo, 37, said after eating at Ms. Marumo’s stall for the first time recently. “Unfortunately, we consume a lot of western food, and it’s always nice to be in touch with the local side of yourself.” In January, Ms. Marumo opened a second food stall. Both are unfussy stands made of wood with flat, tin-sheet roofs sitting on dirt lots. She now employs 11 workers. They come to her modest bungalow every morning at 6, where they fire up about 30 pots under a shelter in the backyard, cooking the day’s menu in a swirl of heat and eye-burning smoke. The result on a recent day was a spread that included a shredded beef dish known as seswaa , a similar version mixed with tripe called mokoto and bogobe jwa lerotse , a thick porridge of sorghum and melon juice. Image Ms. Marumo’s dinners became so popular that in late 2019, she cleared out a bushy field at a busy intersection near her home and set up her first food stall. Two years ago, Ms. Marumo ventured into a new enterprise, holding the first of what she said would be annual women’s empowerment seminars. But given her reputation as an online bully, many are unconvinced that Ms. Marumo is a true champion of women. On social media, she has criticized how some mothers raise their children and questioned the wisdom of some people’s decision to have children in the first place. Online commenters have, in turn, attacked Ms. Marumo with negative comments about her body. They have criticized her food as “soily,” meaning it tastes like dirt. Thato San, a Botswana native who owns a beauty brand, said she was shocked last year when Ms. Marumo suggested online that Ms. San may have been complicit in the drug addiction of one of her friends, a rapper who had recently died. Just months earlier, Ms. San said, she had nominated Ms. Marumo for special recognition at a Women’s Month brunch. “It was disappointing because I looked up to her,” she said. “Her presence on social media, a lot of people would say is very, very negative.” Ms. Marumo argues that she is misunderstood and that her words are often twisted. Her success, she said, had bred contempt and made people feel that they could say anything about her. She feels compelled to speak about women’s issues because of her own experience overcoming doubters, she said. Mothers often contact her for help with their children, and she has volunteered with and raised funds for an orphanage — experiences that Ms. Marumo said have given her a motherly instinct, even though she does not have children of her own. “I am known by many people, but I’m still human,” she said. “I want my freedom. I need my freedom of expression.” Image Enjoying lunch hour at one of the stalls. Ms. Marumo started her cooking business after building a following with her corn sales. Since college, Ms. Marumo has always done things her way, said Benah Sekgabo, who met her in 2011 when they studied together. Ms. Marumo had a unique hairstyle and would design her own shoes, earrings and clothes, saying that she couldn’t buy the same off-the-rack items as her classmates. The social media controversies don’t seem to have hurt business, so far. For some, Ms. Marumo’s brashness is part of her appeal. “She’s a very confident person,” said Losika Mooketsi, a 20-year-old accounting student as she tucked into a plate of Ms. Marumo’s stewed meat. “She doesn’t let anyone bring her down. People can start rumors about her, and she won’t let that faze her.” Behind the steely exterior, though, Ms. Marumo said the withering criticism can be painful. She starts each day reading the Bible and writing motivational messages on sticky notes, which now form a colorful collage on her bedroom door. “Pray for those who have caused me pain,” reads one note. “Thank you God for P1,000,000,” says another, a reference to her goal of earning at least a million Pula (about $76,000), which she said she was still working toward. And then there’s one from a popular Psalm that might sum up her approach to life: “I will fear no evil.” Image Ms. Marumo. “I am known by many people, but I’m still human,” she said. “I want my freedom.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT An architect of Virginia’s aggressive redistricting scheme will announce on Wednesday that he intends to run for one of the newly drawn Democratic seats himself. Dan Helmer, a four-term state delegate who played a key behind-the-scenes role in last October’s surprise move to redraw Virginia’s congressional maps , is entering the race for the lobster-shaped Seventh Congressional District that will be created if voters approve a constitutional amendment to allow for mid-decade redistricting. A top ally to Don Scott, the Virginia House speaker, Mr. Helmer served as campaigns chairman for the Virginia House Democratic Caucus as the party took control of the chamber in 2023 and then flipped 13 more Republican-held seats last November. Last fall, Mr. Helmer helped devise and implement the redistricting strategy and then marshaled support in Richmond for the first set of votes on the amendment to redraw congressional maps. He later recused himself from the map-drawing process. “We need fighters with a proven track record of not just standing up but winning against Donald Trump and the Republican Congress to get our country back in the right direction,” Mr. Helmer said in an interview. “I’m a progressive fighter with an unmatched record of taking on Trump and winning.” The Seventh is one of four new districts likely to favor Democrats that would be created if Virginia voters pass the redistricting amendment on April 21. It begins at the Potomac River in Arlington and stretches west to the West Virginia border in one lobster claw and south past Richmond to rural Powhatan County, in the other. Vice President Kamala Harris won 54 percent of the vote there in 2024, and Joseph R. Biden Jr. took 56 percent in 2020. An Army veteran of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Mr. Helmer, 44, entered state politics in 2019 on a platform of gun control and abortion rights. He flipped the last Republican-held state House seat in Fairfax County, a Washington suburb that was then in the final stages of a transition from Republican territory to one that now votes for Democrats by large margins. Mr. Helmer is the second Democrat to enter the race, following J.P. Cooney, a top deputy to Jack Smith , the special prosecutor who twice indicted Mr. Trump. Image J.P. Cooney announced his candidacy last week. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times While Mr. Cooney, a career federal prosecutor, is a relative newcomer to Virginia politics, Mr. Helmer has run for Northern Virginia congressional seats twice before, losing in Democratic primaries in 2018 and 2024 . He has built a political base in Fairfax County and among the state’s power brokers in Richmond. Mr. Helmer enters the race with endorsements from former Gov. Ralph Northam; 43 of Virginia’s 84 other Democratic state legislators; and Representative Eugene Vindman, a Virginia Democrat whose current district covers much of the territory Mr. Helmer seeks to represent. “Dan Helmer delivered the largest Democratic majority in four decades,” Mr. Scott, the Virginia House speaker, said. “He whipped Virginia Republicans — Republicans in D.C. should be trembling in their orthopedic shoes.” Though Mr. Helmer helped to whip votes for the constitutional amendment last fall, he said he was not involved in drawing the proposed new maps, an assertion confirmed by several people involved. Still, there was a widespread belief among Virginia Democrats as the new maps were being debated that a new Democratic seat would be drawn for Mr. Helmer. Mr. Helmer said his primary role in drawing the new maps was leading the party’s campaign committee in the House of Delegates to elect new Democrats to the chamber. “There are 17 Republican-held seats that are now held by Democrats,” Mr. Helmer said. “That has allowed us to put redistricting in front of the people, and I’m convinced they will allow us to enact new maps.” Reid J.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Democrats knew in real time last year that they had bungled their response to President Trump’s address to a joint session of Congress, making themselves a distraction rather than offering a cohesive message of resistance to his policies. Representative Al Green, a liberal septuagenarian from Texas, was ejected from the chamber (and later censured) after disrupting the speech with a cane-waving tirade . The paddles that some Democrats waved with short messages on them — “Save Medicaid,” “Musk Steals” and one that just read “False” — were widely panned as a hokey and incoherent response. It was all out of step with the sober, centrist counter to Mr. Trump that party leaders had wanted to project that night. They’re trying something different on Tuesday, when Mr. Trump is scheduled to deliver the first State of the Union address of his second term. A substantial number of Democrats are planning to boycott the speech and attend an alternative event, a rally called the “People’s State of the Union,” which will take place on the National Mall near the Capitol. The event, which is being coordinated by the left-wing advocacy group MoveOn and MeidasTouch, a progressive media company, will feature Democratic lawmakers speaking with people who have been negatively affected by Mr. Trump’s economic and health care policies, as well as federal workers who lost their jobs and immigrants who have been targeted by the Trump administration. It will be hosted by the liberal political commentators Joy Reid and Katie Phang. “He’s made a mockery of the State of the Union speech and he doesn’t deserve an audience,” Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said of Mr. Trump in an interview, explaining why he planned to attend the rally instead of the speech. “He’s going to tell 40 different lies, call Democrats names; he’s going to paper over his corruption; and I don’t feel like what he’s doing dignifies having Democrats there to cloak the speech in a veneer of respectability.” Mr. Murphy, who also skipped the address last year, added: “These aren’t normal times, and we have to stop doing normal things.” Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, attended Mr. Trump’s speech last year but walked out before the end. (Last year, the president spoke for roughly 100 minutes.) This year, Mr. Van Hollen said, he won’t be going. “We cannot normalize this moment when Trump is marching our country toward fascism,” said Mr. Van Hollen, who will also speak at the rally. “I refuse to be a prop in the chamber as Donald Trump shreds our Constitution and attacks our democracy.” Image Representative Al Green yelled in protest as Mr. Trump addressed Congress last year. Credit... Kenny Holston/The New York Times It is unclear how many Democratic members of Congress will attend the speech. Some have expressed concern that boycotting en masse would leave Mr. Trump with a purely sycophantic audience. But even a sizable boycott would break with a tradition, which most Democrats adhered to even through the first Trump administration, of the opposing party dutifully sitting through a speech they mostly disagree with. Even when they registered their disapproval with acts of protest — like when former Speaker Nancy Pelosi ripped up Mr. Trump’s speech when he was finished delivering it — they mostly showed up. Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and minority leader, has encouraged members to either sit silently through the speech or boycott it altogether, rather than attend and create distractions in the House chamber. Mr. Jeffries on Tuesday said it was his “present intention” to attend. “We’re not going to his house, he’s coming to our house,” he told reporters at a news conference. “Having grown up where I grew up, you never let anyone run you off your block.” (Mr. Jeffries grew up in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn.) Lawmakers who are skipping the speech for the rally so far include Senators Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts and Tina Smith of Minnesota, as well as House Democrats including Representatives Becca Balint of Vermont, Greg Casar of Texas, Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Delia Ramirez of Illinois. Another contingent of lawmakers is expected to walk out of the address while Mr. Trump is speaking and make their way to the competing event. “We know that he is going to use the State of the Union to mislead the American people and lie,” said Sara Haghdoosti, the chief of program at MoveOn Civic Action. “We want to make sure we’re focusing on the impact his horrendous policies have had. We want to shift the focus from Trump’s lies to the stories of people.” Annie Karni is a congressional correspondent for The Times.

Image Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, during a Senate hearing last Thursday. Credit... Eric Lee for The New York Times The White House on Tuesday rejected the latest offer from Democratic lawmakers on proposed new constraints on federal immigration officers, the latest sign that there would not be a quick resolution of the stalemate that has left the Department of Homeland Security without funding since Saturday. A White House official who provided a statement on the condition of anonymity to describe private negotiations said the two parties were still far apart, adding that President Trump’s team remained interested in continuing good-faith talks to resolve the impasse. In response, aides for the Democratic leaders in Congress said that Republicans had largely ignored the guardrails the public was demanding, and urged them to start negotiating in good faith as they said their side had been doing. Both White House officials and Democrats on Capitol Hill have kept largely confidential the specifics of their offers to end the standoff that allowed funding for the agency to lapse as of 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The outlines of the Democratic demands, however, are well known: limits on masked police, an end to random sweeps, new requirements for judicial warrants, putting “sensitive locations” such as churches, schools, hospitals and polling places off limits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement among them. The offer was given to the White House Monday evening but brushed aside by the White House less than 24 hours later. “These are common sense,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said Sunday on CNN about the Democratic proposals. “Police departments across America use them. We have a rogue agency. Why don’t we rein them in? That’s what the American people are asking Republicans.” Democrats have portrayed the earlier White House counteroffer to Democrats, which has not been made public, as “nonserious.” People familiar with the talks have said that the White House has not been responsive to many of the Democratic demands for limits on federal immigration agents, and has pushed for new authority of its own, including increased penalties for those who dox officers. Some Republicans have also said that they want an end to local and state policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, sometimes called sanctuary city policies, in exchange for concessions. “When it comes to masks, I don’t know of another law enforcement agency in the country that has an 8,000-percent increase in threats,” Tom Homan, President Trump’s border czar, said Sunday on CBS News’s “Face the Nation.” “Just yesterday, the director of ICE, his wife was filmed walking to work. His home address has been doxed. His kids have been doxed and filmed.” With Congress on a weeklong recess and lawmakers scattered around the world and the nation, chances for approval of a funding agreement this week remained remote since members would have to return to Washington to pass it and the negotiations were not showing any movement. Democrats made clear they intended to stick to their demands and did not appear to be uneasy about any political backlash for blocking money for the agency that also funds airport security, the Coast Guard and disaster relief. “We need change that is dramatic, that is bold, that is meaningful and that is transformational,” Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the House minority leader, said on CBS. “For instance, judicial warrants should be required before ICE agents can storm private property or rip everyday Americans out of their homes.” Many of the Department of Homeland Security’s workers remain on the job but run the risk of missing a paycheck if the funding fight drags on. Mr. Trump is scheduled to deliver the first formal State of the Union address of his second term before Congress next Tuesday. Without some breakthrough, he will make the speech before Congress with one agency without a congressional appropriation for the year, though ICE has a separate pot of money from an earlier measure that can keep it operating.

Credit Credit... Valentin Flauraud/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Indirect talks between American and Iranian officials in Switzerland ended on Tuesday with an agreement on a “set of guiding principles,” according to Iran’s foreign minister, who said both sides had agreed to exchange drafts on a potential deal. The foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, was as positive as he was vague, providing little clarity on what had been discussed or when the next round of discussions might be held. American officials did not immediately comment publicly on the talks, but one U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations, said the two sides had made progress. The official said the Iranians would provide more detailed proposals in the next two weeks to address some of the gaps between the United States and Iran, but did not provide any specifics. Mr. Araghchi told Iranian state television that the talks, which were held in Geneva and lasted about three hours, had been “more constructive” and had made “good progress” compared with a previous round of negotiations in Oman this month. “We now have a clear path ahead, which in my view is positive,” he said. But Mr. Araghchi said a deal was not imminent, as the Middle East remained on edge over the possibility of an American attack should negotiations collapse. Iran has insisted that the talks be strictly limited to its nuclear program, even as U.S. officials have said they would push to curb the range of Iran’s ballistic missiles and its support of militias across the region. Mr. Araghchi did not address those points in his comments to Iranian state television, saying only that the two sides had reached a “general understanding on a set of guiding principles” to continue discussions and to “move toward drafting the text of a possible agreement.” “This does not mean that we can reach an agreement quickly, but at least the path has begun,” he said. Three Iranian officials familiar with the talks said that Iran had indicated a willingness to suspend nuclear enrichment for three to five years — which would cover the duration of Mr. Trump’s presidency — and then join a regional consortium for civilian grade enrichment. Iran would also dilute its stockpile of uranium on its own soil in the presence of international inspectors. In exchange, Iran has demanded that the United States lift financial and banking sanctions and the embargo on its oil sales. The officials, who asked not to be identified to discuss sensitive negotiations, said Iran was also dangling financial incentives and opportunities for investments and trade with the United States, including in Iran’s oil and energy sectors. The negotiations were hosted at the Omani ambassador’s residence by Oman’s foreign minister, Badr Albusaidi, who mediated the previous round of talks. A spokesman for Iran’s foreign ministry said ahead of the talks that Omani officials would shuttle between the two sides. Mr. Albusaidi said on social media after the talks that they had concluded “with good progress towards identifying common goals and relevant technical issues.” “Together we made serious efforts to define a number of guiding principles for a final deal,” he added.",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday released its final report on the midair collision near Ronald Reagan National Airport last year that killed 67 people, as the House announced plans to vote next week on legislation to address some of the institutional failures that investigators said led to the accident. The 419-page document , which brings the board’s intense scrutiny of the accident to a close, did not contain any bombshell revelations, as the board detailed its findings and recommendations late last month. But its presentation of how missed warnings, institutional failures and human errors serve as a detailed and at times devastating account of the episode, which the safety board’s chairwoman, Jennifer Homendy, has said was “100 percent preventable.” The report’s recommendations also serve as a list of action items for aviation safety advocates, who have been pushing for some of the advised changes since long before the crash. But it will be up to Congress and federal agencies whether to implement any of the recommendations. In Congress, the Senate has passed a bipartisan bill to compel the Federal Aviation Administration to conduct safety reviews of airports, and require planes flying through busy airspace to have advanced location tracking technology. That would address two of the key factors that the N.T.S.B. identified in its findings about what caused an Army Black Hawk helicopter to fly into American Airlines Flight 5342 on the night of Jan. 29, without any of the pilots realizing they were on a collision course until barely more than a second before they crashed. But in the House, Representative Sam Graves of Missouri, the Republican chairman of that chamber’s transportation committee, has resisted pressure to advance the legislation. Justin Harclerode, a spokesman for the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said in a statement on Tuesday that the Republican and Democratic leaders of that panel and the one overseeing armed services were “working expeditiously on a comprehensive bill to address the range of issues identified by the N.T.S.B.’s now complete investigation.” He added that the House would soon move forward with its own legislation. Nonetheless, on Tuesday afternoon, following the release of the N.T.S.B. report, House leaders announced plans to put the legislation passed by the Senate to a vote as soon as Monday, with no changes. Two-thirds of the House will have to support the legislation in order for it to pass. During a hearing last week to review the N.T.S.B.’s findings, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Senate committee overseeing transportation, maintained that the bill would “begin to protect the flying public now, which is why the House should pass it and put it on the president’s desk.” Image Family members of those killed in the accident attended a hearing last week that reviewed the N.T.S.B.’s findings on the crash. Credit... Elizabeth Frantz for The New York Times The F.A.A. and the Army have so far not committed to implementing extensive new recommendations the N.T.S.B. approved late last month. Last year, however, the F.A.A. did heed the N.T.S.B.’s recommendations to redirect helicopter traffic around the airport and drastically limit the number of aircraft allowed to pass through the airspace without broadcasting their location to other planes. It implemented the changes just days after the board requested them. “Since Secretary Duffy took office, he and the F.A.A. have taken decisive steps to correct past failures, strengthen accountability and modernize” the national airspace, the F.A.A. said in a statement, referring to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. “Today, we are acting proactively to mitigate risks before they affect the traveling public.” The Army did not respond to a request for comment. The relationship between the F.A.A. and Army has been strained as the aviation safety agency tries to regulate the movements of military aircraft through busy airspace and the military presses to relax the restrictions. In the last week, those tensions were exacerbated by a standoff in El Paso. The F.A.A. temporarily restricted all flights under 18,000 feet there after U.S. Customs and Border Protection, using a high-energy counter-drone laser on loan from the Pentagon, shot down a metallic balloon. The F.A.A. had not yet approved plans to deploy the technology, permission that is required by law. In its final report, the N.T.S.B. issued eight recommendations to the Army. Most of them were directed at training military aviators about the challenges of flying near Reagan National, the limitations of the equipment on board their aircraft, and the collection and assessment of flight safety data. But the bulk of the N.T.S.B.’s new recommendations — 33 of them — were directed at the F.A.A., which board members faulted for poor airport design at Reagan National, ignoring multiple warnings about the potential for collisions. The board also described a culture within the F.A.A. that caused controllers to become accustomed to overwork that sometimes detracted from their ability to closely monitor flights coming dangerously close to one another. On the night of the accident on Jan. 29, 2025, one controller was handling both airplane and helicopter traffic — a double load that the N.T.S.B. found was unnecessary because the control tower at Reagan National had enough staff on hand to avoid it. The board also determined that the controller gave the helicopter pilots too much latitude to manage their own flight through the congested airspace around Reagan National, and never warned the commercial jet pilots to keep an eye out for the Army Black Hawk headed their way. The board also stressed that mandating the use of more advanced location tracking technology — a recommendation it has made as part of multiple aviation accident investigations — could have given the pilots a chance to avoid hitting each other in the contorted airspace around Reagan National, even without the guidance of a controller.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT By the early afternoon on Tuesday, mourners had left around half a dozen bouquets of flowers and a few balloons outside of the Rev. Jesse Jackson’s Tudor-style house on Constance Avenue in the South Shore neighborhood. Next door, Junelle Speller said she had bought her home because she fell in love with the house, but living beside Mr. Jackson was a wonderful bonus. “It was always surreal for us to be living next door to a civil rights icon, someone my husband and I both studied in school here in Chicago,” Mrs. Speller said. Despite Mr. Jackson’s larger-than-life persona and soaring oratory skills, Mrs. Speller soon discovered that in person the civil rights leader “was very grounded, very down to earth, approachable, personable and vibrant.” “He had a deliberate but very inspirational way of speaking,” she said. “You’d be kind of awestruck. But he was at your level, meeting you and sharing those stories, providing motivation for this period of time, for the African American community.” Anita O’Neal, 67, stopped by the Jackson home and showed reporters gathered outside the house a wrinkled photo of herself from 1968. She was 11 years old in the picture, wearing a prim, white outfit for a flight from Chicago to Cape Girardeau, Mo. Sitting in a seat and looking up at her is a young Mr. Jackson, who at the time was a protégé of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Ms. O’Neal said she had come to appreciate the experience only later on in life. “I read about who he was and understood who he was. It was quite an honor for me,” she said. Image Anita O’Neal shows a photo of herself with Jesse Jackson when she was 11 years old. Credit... Nam Y. Huh/Associated Press Ms. O’Neal recalled Mr. Jackson’s quieter side. When he would attend services at St. Sabina Church in the Auburn Gresham neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side, he wouldn’t draw attention to himself, she said. “He wouldn’t come with fanfare,” she said. “He would just walk in, walk down the center aisle, and just go on and sit down.” The pastor, Michael L. Pfleger, would introduce him, she recalled, but Mr. Jackson “didn’t want any recognition. He was there for service.” Joy Jones, 66, said she had come straight to Mr. Jackson’s house after working an overnight shift at a hospital in the Bronzeville neighborhood on the city’s South Side. Still dressed in her purple scrubs, Ms. Jones said she hoped someone would follow in Mr. Jackson’s footsteps just as Mr. Jackson picked up Mr. King’s fight for civil rights after his assassination. “I’m praying that someone will stand up and will continue the movement forward,” Ms. Jones said. “Because it seems this administration is trying to make us take some steps backward, but I really hope that someone — male, female, someone — will stand up and say, ‘We’ve got to keep moving. We’ve got to keep going.’” Among the other Chicagoans who dropped by to pay their respects was Delores Brown, who set down a bouquet of flowers next to the small shrine that had been growing on the Jackson family’s front lawn. He had been a role model, she said, for people in the South Side community where she lived, especially for young Black men. “He’s also been a person that has spoken for us on so many levels when we were not able to speak for ourselves,” she said.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The Rev. Jesse Jackson’s death comes at a moment when Black voters are hugely influential within the Democratic Party and there are more Black senators than ever before — yet the future of Black representation in the House of Representatives is uncertain. The Supreme Court is set to rule in the coming months on a case that will determine the fate of a key provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the federal law that undergirds Southern Black representation in the House. In arguments last fall, the conservative-leaning court seemed skeptical of a key provision of the law, a signature achievement of the civil rights era. Black voters overwhelmingly support the Democratic Party, despite President Trump’s notable gains with them in 2024, and some Democrats and Black faith leaders argue that the country is going backward on civil rights. “We are witnessing right now in real time the kind of attack on voting rights that really does harken back to the darkest days of the civil rights struggle,” Senator Raphael Warnock, a Georgia Democrat and the pastor of the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, said on Tuesday. “I owe it to Rev. Jackson, and we owe it to the next generation, to pass voting rights and ensure that we level the playing field so that every voice can be heard in our democracy.” Some conservatives say that decades of rising political power for Black Americans mean that old legal and policy interventions like the Voting Rights Act are no longer necessary. During oral arguments in the case in October, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said that “this court’s cases, in a variety of contexts, have said that race-based remedies are permissible for a period of time — sometimes for a long period of time, decades in some cases — but that they should not be indefinite, and should have an end point.” Image President Lyndon B. Johnson signing the Voting Rights Act in 1965 as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., center, looked on. Credit... Yoichi Okamoto/LBJ Presidential Library Some Black Republicans, however, have voiced support for the civil rights legislation. “I think the Voting Rights Act is very important — it’s an important part of our history,” Ben Carson, a housing secretary in the first Trump administration, said in an interview. “We should unite around that fact and not let ourselves be divided.” Mr. Carson, who said that he had met Mr. Jackson while still a surgeon and that the civil rights leader had been an early supporter of his books, added: “What’s necessary is that Americans have their voting rights protected, all Americans.” For Democrats, defending the voting rights of Black Americans is also about politics. The influence of Black voters in Democratic presidential primary contests is undeniable: In 2008, 2016 and 2020, Southern states where the primary electorates are dominated by Black voters swung heavily toward the party’s eventual nominees. In those primary races, Black voters in South Carolina and then across the South helped lift Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Joseph R. Biden Jr. to victory, thwarting Mrs. Clinton in her first run, Bernie Sanders and then Mr. Sanders again. Image Joseph R. Biden Jr. meeting supporters after winning the South Carolina Democratic primary race in 2020. His victory there propelled him to the party’s nomination. Credit... Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times In each case, Black voters were pragmatic, said Jaime Harrison, a former chairman of both the Democratic National Committee and the South Carolina Democratic Party, choosing a candidate they believed had the best chance of winning the general election. And now, before the order of states has been set for the 2028 primary contest, a parade of would-be White House hopefuls have made their way to South Carolina. Govs. Gavin Newsom of California and Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, Representative Ro Khanna of California and others have visited the state in recent months with an apparent eye on ingratiating themselves with its largely Black primary electorate. “You’ve seen it election cycle after election cycle,” Mr. Harrison said. “The Black vote has been determinative in the presidential primary. As the first domino falls in South Carolina, it falls the same way across the rest of the South.” Of the 11 Black people ever elected to the Senate , five are serving now: Mr. Booker, Mr. Warnock and Senators Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland and Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, both Democrats. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina is the lone Black Republican senator. Clockwise from top left: Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, Senator Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Senator Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland. The New York Times Ms. Alsobrooks said in an interview on Tuesday that there was “responsibility and pride” in knowing that she is part of the largest group of Black senators to ever serve together. She said the impact went beyond policies debated on the Senate floor. She recalled a day last summer when she arrived after having had her hair braided. “I went to walk onto the Senate floor, when one of the U.S. Capitol Police officers stopped me, and he was thrilled,” she said. “He said, ‘Can I please take a photo with you?’” She added, “He had been in that building for many years and said, ‘Do you know you’re the first person to have ever stepped on the floor of the United States Senate with your hair in braids?’” The provision before the Supreme Court, Section 2, prohibits election or voting practices that discriminate on the basis of race. That guidance has led to the creation of majority-minority districts that are meant to help voters of color elect candidates of their choice. If the court fully struck down the provision, Democrats could lose about a dozen majority-minority districts across the South, according to an analysis by The New York Times . Many of those seats are currently held by Black lawmakers. Even before the Supreme Court ruling arrives, several Republican-led states have already eliminated districts with Black House representatives during the nation’s current gerrymandering battle. In Texas, Representative Marc Veasey, a Democrat, announced he would not run for re-election after he was drawn out of his seat. Representative Al Green, another Democrat, was drawn out of his longtime district and will now run for a different seat in a March primary race . In North Carolina, Representative Don Davis will have a much more difficult re-election fight after the state redrew its maps in October . And in Missouri, a new map threatens the re-election chances of Representative Emanuel Cleaver, a Democrat who has spent 20 years in Congress and was the first Black mayor of Kansas City. This century, the Supreme Court has chipped away at the Voting Rights Act. In 2013, the court struck down another key provision , Section 5, which required states with a history of racial discrimination at the polls to obtain federal approval before changing voting laws. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote in the opinion that “things have changed dramatically” since the law’s adoption decades ago. During oral arguments on the current Voting Rights Act case, Hashim M. Mooppan, a principal deputy solicitor general in the Trump administration, said that many Black members of Congress now hailed from districts that were not majority-minority. “None of these positions is going to lead to there being no Black representation in Congress or anything remotely approaching that,” he said. But civil rights leaders contend that the legal erosion of the Voting Rights Act will hurt Black Americans’ political power. “So here we are, Jesse Jackson dies today, and we have less voting rights protection under the Voting Rights Act than we had on Aug. 6, 1965,” said Bishop William Barber II, a civil-rights leader.

Vest for The New York Times The museum at the Lorraine Motel was closed, typical for a Tuesday. Yet on a cloudy Memphis day, with a cold wind whipping the flags lowered to half-staff, there were still a few people who came to pay their respects outside. On this day, it was not just about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whose assassination on a balcony at the motel on April 4, 1968, defined the city in American history. For at least a couple of visitors, it was a chance to mourn the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who died at 84 on Tuesday and was among the people who witnessed the murder and sought to carry on Dr. King’s civil rights legacy. “I had to be there,” said Theresa Jackson, 56, who had pulled over Tuesday morning, on her way back to Illinois from Biloxi, Miss. Visiting the motel, which is now home to the National Civil Rights Museum , “gave me chills, just the presence of being there.” Across the South, leaders mourned the death of Mr. Jackson, who was born in South Carolina and crisscrossed the region campaigning for civil rights, championing voter registration and making two unsuccessful bids for the presidency. But in Memphis, where Mr. Jackson returned again and again to the site of Dr. King’s assassination, there was a unique grief over the loss of an elder who had inspired the city’s next generation of Black leaders. “He was a fixture,” Mayor Paul Young said in an interview on Tuesday, recounting how as a young student, he voted for Mr. Jackson in a mock presidential election because “he was somebody I could see myself in, that looked like me.” He met Mr. Jackson at the 2024 Democratic National Convention, Mr. Young recalled, and they had a conversation that was both “personal and meaningful.” “I get to serve as mayor today,” Mr. Young said, “tied to the ground that he broke.” Mr. Jackson embodied the connection between Chicago, where he lived, and Memphis, a familiar stop for many Black Americans traveling north. “He almost was sort of like a son of Memphis in many ways,” said State Representative Justin Pearson, who represents Memphis in the Tennessee General Assembly and received a phone call from Mr. Jackson in 2023 after Mr. Pearson’s colleagues had expelled him from the chamber over a gun control protest. “His connection to our city is obviously deeply rooted in sort of the grief of that loss of Dr. King, but also in this desire and willingness to see our city thrive, to become a better place,” Mr. Pearson added. Mr. Jackson built a partnership with Stax Records , a prominent Memphis institution , spreading his message as a signed, spoken-word recording artist. He spoke at churches and schools, stopped at the occasional barbecue j",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Long before the Rev. Jesse Jackson cemented his legacy as a civil-rights leader in struggles across the country and the world, he was a young boy growing up in Greenville, S.C., in an extremely segregated and poor part of the South that would shape his understanding of race in America. It was a place that Mr. Jackson often invoked in speeches. At the 1988 Democratic National Convention in Atlanta, he described how he was born “in a three-room house, bathroom in the backyard, slop jar by the bed, no hot and cold running water.” He was “born in the slum,” he told the audience, “but the slum was not born in me.” On Tuesday, residents in Greenville reflected on those humble beginnings as they learned of Mr. Jackson’s death at the age of 84 . “He is our son,” said Davida Mathis, a lawyer and activist whose father coached Mr. Jackson in football at Sterling High School. “He was our superstar.” As he grew older, Mr. Jackson turned into a studious, strong and extremely confident “super boy,” neighbors said, someone who ignored coaches’ drawn-up plays as quarterback, who ran errands for neighbors on his bike, and who wrote in yearbooks that he would one day be president — never mind that in the 1950s, it was illegal for him to even sit in the front of a bus. Greenville was also the place that kick-started his involvement in civil rights. In the summer of 1960, when Mr. Jackson was not yet 20 years old, he helped lead a march with seven other Black students at the Greenville public library that had denied him access. And in 2002, when he learned that Greenville County did not acknowledge Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a paid holiday, he flew there every few weeks to petition the local government to begin honoring it. When that didn’t work, he helped organize a march. And after that, he and his allies backed Republican primary candidates who promised to vote for the holiday. Those candidates won, and the county now closes for business on that day. “He’s one of ours who’s done good, and I think that gets overlooked, especially in conversations about the South and activism,” said Avery Allen, a Greenville native who knew Mr. Jackson her entire life. Ken Gibson, a member of the Greenville City Council who knew Mr. Jackson well, described him on Tuesday as “a phenomenal individual.” “He had the most fantastic presence, and he just filled a room,” said Mr. Gibson, whose parents were civil-rights activists with the N.A.A.C.P. in the early 1960s. Still, residents say that Greenville’s celebration of Mr. Jackson feels more muted than in other cities in the South that have birthed titans of the Civil Rights era. In Birmingham, Ala., for example, the city’s airport is named after Fred Shuttlesworth, a Black leader who survived beatings and bombings. At North Carolina A&T University — which Mr. Jackson attended — there is a monument dedicated to the four students who sat down at the segregated lunch counter of the Woolworth’s store.

Nick Madigan But in Greenville, S.C., there is no major street, historical marker or monument dedicated to Mr. Jackson, residents noted. Several years ago, there was an effort to preserve his childhood home on Haynie Street as a historical site. But the project fizzled after the councilwoman who led the effort died in 2016. “The fact that Jesse Jackson brings recognition to Greenville and to South Carolina, you would think that they would take advantage of that legacy to use it for tourism,” said Abel A. Bartley, a professor of African American and civil rights history at Clemson University. “The things he did to move our country and our nation forward on civil rights deserves some kind of recognition. And his hometown in particular should lead the way.” Some in Greenville were more interested on Tuesday in reminiscing about quieter, more intimate memories. They remembered Mr. Jackson’s trips back home when he was already an established political figure, how he would ask to go to S & S Cafeteria on Pleasantburg Drive to order his favorite banana cream pie. And they recalled the rhyme and riddle game he would play with his mother, Helen Burns, even in the months before her death in 2015. He would stand by her bedside at the hospital, say a random phrase like “big son went down to the river,” and she would respond with a sentence that rhymed and matched thematically. Freddie Jean Clinkscales, 84, who went to high school with Mr. Jackson, looked up at the house on Haynie Street on Tuesday. She thought of the young man who “was always trying to help everybody,” she said, and who decades later fought to make sure she could sit wherever she wanted to. It had felt so belittling in her youth to step onto an empty bus and be forced to hold herself steady with a pole in the back. If it had not been for people like Mr. Jackson, she said, “we’d still be hanging onto that pole.” Eduardo Medina is a Times reporter covering the South.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Over the past year, the Trump administration has engaged in unconventional diplomacy, gunboat diplomacy and, in the most sensitive crises, diplomacy without diplomats. On Tuesday, the administration tried all three tactics at once. In Geneva, President Trump’s most trusted envoys — his real estate friend Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner — engaged the Iranians in the morning, then the Russians and the Ukrainians in the afternoon. It was a stark example of Mr. Trump’s conviction that the State Department and the National Security Council, the two institutions that have coordinated negotiations over global crises for nearly 80 years, are best left on the sidelines. And so, the Witkoff-Kushner duo has been at the center of recent efforts to end a nuclear crisis in Iran that has stretched over two decades, and a war in Ukraine that is days away from entering its fifth year. By all accounts, Mr. Trump has confidence in their approach, reinforced by their negotiations last year to win a cease-fire in Gaza and the return of all Israeli hostages held by Hamas. And countries like Russia, Turkey and the Gulf Arab states have welcomed the arrival of the two men, with their transactional approach born of New York property negotiations, especially given the greater flexibility offered by Mr. Witkoff and Mr. Kushner. They talk the language of deal makers, and do not spend much time lecturing on human rights or democracy building. And not infrequently, their interlocutors on diplomatic issues are closely linked to the business deals that the Trump and Witkoff families are negotiating. “Some countries really welcome this informal structure at the Trump White House,” said Asli Aydintasbas, a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. But, she added, “I have not seen anyone hugely impressed with the diplomatic skills of the current team.” One person close to the Kremlin said that Russian officials appreciated Mr. Witkoff’s warmth and enthusiasm for the negotiations, even as they sometimes doubted his reliability as a messenger. But he was clearly new to the issues dividing Washington and Moscow, and at first brought no other American experts into his negotiations. More recently, the Russians have been happy to have Mr. Kushner’s involvement, the person said, because of his more organized and structured approach. Some Russians have taken to calling the duo “Witkoff and Zyatkoff,” because “zyat” is Russian for son-in-law. The Iranians also have a nickname for Mr. Kushner, using the Persian word for son-in-law: Damad Trump, again defining Mr. Kushner’s influence by virtue of his marriage to the president’s daughter, Ivanka. Iranian media have dedicated coverage and columns to Mr. Kushner’s participation. Ahmad Zeidabadi, a prominent political analyst and columnist, wrote in Asr Iran newspaper that Mr. Kushner’s participation in talks was something “positive.” “He represents the pragmatic and softer side of Trump,” he said. Mr. Kushner, in an interview last October , said that his and Mr. Witkoff’s approach to diplomacy relied on being “deal guys” who “have to understand people.” Mr. Witkoff was known in real estate circles for major transactions, including buying the Woolworth Building, once New York’s tallest skyscraper, in 1998. Mr. Kushner followed his father, the real estate developer Charles Kushner, into the business and later expanded into private equity. Mr. Kushner holds no official government title, and gets no government salary, while Mr. Witkoff is a U.S. “special envoy.” In Mr. Trump’s first term, Mr. Kushner spearheaded the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab countries — though his hopes of bringing Saudi Arabia aboard have not yet come to fruition. Last year, his efforts negotiating the cease-fire in Gaza drew praise even from some Democrats, for pushing closer to ending a war that President Joseph R. Biden Jr. could not. Supporters of the administration see Mr. Witkoff and Mr. Kushner as ideal negotiators in part because their personal wealth, they say, makes them more resistant to corrupting influences. But both men face questions over apparent conflicts of interest. Mr. Witkoff’s son Zach is the chief executive of World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s cryptocurrency company. An investment firm tied to the United Arab Emirates purchased nearly half the company last year for $500 million. Mr. Kushner raised several billion dollars before Mr. Trump’s second term from overseas investors, including government wealth funds in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, countries he had worked with when he served as a senior White House adviser during Mr. Trump’s first term. Yet as they engage with Mr. Witkoff and Mr. Kushner, the Russians and the Iranians share a strategy: delay. At the Munich Security Conference last weekend, several participants on the edges of the negotiations over Ukraine, which Russia invaded four years ago next Tuesday, said repeatedly that Russia had every reason to engage in the negotiations and little compelling reason to sign an agreement. President Vladimir V. Putin believes he is winning, military and intelligence officials from several Western countries said in recent days. And he is convinced that even if it takes 18 months to two years to complete his hold on the Donbas region, each day of fighting and each night of Russian missiles and drones raining down on energy infrastructure and apartment buildings secure him more leverage. For the Iranians, delay is the regime’s last strategy for survival. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was in Slovakia and Hungary early this week but is not participating in either of the Geneva negotiations, made the case for pessimism. “It’s going to be hard,” he told reporters. “It’s been very difficult for anyone to do real deals with Iran, because we’re dealing with radical Shia clerics who are making theological decisions, not geopolitical ones.” But the commonalities end there. In the Iranian case, Mr. Trump is backing up his diplomacy with a threat of fairly imminent military action if there is no progress — maybe in days, perhaps in weeks. In the Russia-Ukraine case, he has slowed down the military pressure, halting the direct provision of arms to Ukraine that took place — with strong congressional support — in the Biden years. The president has also cracked down on the Russian “shadow fleet” selling oil, exacerbating Mr. Putin’s deepening economic troubles, even while the Trump administration floats ideas about U.S. investment in Russia if a deal, almost any deal, can be announced. Given those dynamics, some analysts predicted that Mr. Putin could still make a deal to stop the fighting in Ukraine, especially if he secured a far-reaching rapprochement with the United States and a withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from the rest of the Donbas. The negotiations with Iran are overshadowed by the size of the U.S. naval force — a “great armada” in Mr. Trump’s telling — that is being assembled in the Red Sea, clearly positioned to strike if the president so decides. But the Iranians are hardly de-escalating. They have temporarily closed the Strait of Hormuz because of Iranian live fire exercises, a not-so-gentle reminder of the country’s ability to throw energy markets into chaos. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, did not contribute much to the spirit of finding a nonmilitary solution when he was asked about the presence of one U.S. carrier group and the arrival in a week or so of a second — a huge massing of firepower. “An aircraft carrier is a dangerous machine, but even more dangerous than that is the weapon capable of sending it to the bottom of the sea,” he said as he commemorated the 1978 uprising that toppled the pro-American Shah of Iran. (The Shah’s son, Reza Pahlavi, was in Munich over the weekend, at one of many large protests around the world that echoed his calls for th",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The U.S. Capitol Police arrested an 18-year-old man on Tuesday afternoon after he exited a vehicle and ran toward the Capitol building with a loaded shotgun. No one was hurt and there was no further threat to the area, the agency said. The episode occurred just after noon, when the armed man got out of a white Mercedes S.U.V. parked on Maryland Avenue and began running toward the Capitol, Chief Michael G. Sullivan of the Capitol Police told reporters. Capitol Police officers confronted the man at the base of a staircase walkway near the West Front of the building, drew their firearms and ordered him to drop his weapon. The man “immediately complied” and lay on the ground, where he was taken into custody, Mr. Sullivan said. The man was wearing a tactical vest and gloves and carrying additional ammunition rounds. A Kevlar helmet and a gas mask were also found in his vehicle, Mr. Sullivan said. Investigators were still working to determine the man’s motive. Capitol Police temporarily closed a section of Maryland Avenue near the Garfield Monument, and the authorities have footage of the man but were asking members of the public who may have taken additional cellphone footage to send it in, Mr. Sullivan said. Capitol Police identified the man as Carter Camacho of Smyrna, Ga., and said in a statement that he was arrested for unlawful activities, carrying a rifle without a license, having an unregistered firearm and having unregistered ammunition. He was not previously known to Capitol Police, and there did not appear to be any other suspects involved, the agency said. Congress was not in session this week, but the episode comes at a time when lawmakers have faced escalating threats. A man attacked Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota during a town hall event in Minneapolis less than a month ago, and lawmakers had already been grappling with intense fears about their personal safety after the assassination of the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk on a college campus. Capitol Police said it had investigated nearly 15,000 “concerning statements, behaviors, and communications directed against members of Congress, their families, staff, and the Capitol complex” in 2025, roughly a 58 percent increase over 2024 . Mr. Sullivan, who commended the officers who responded on Tuesday for their “brave service,” said that Capitol Police had held an active shooter exercise a few months ago “virtually in the same spot” where the man was confronted. “We do those active shooter exercises every single month,” he said, “and that’s why we do it.” Anushka Patil is a Times reporter covering breaking and developing news around the world.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The United States indicted the captain of an oil tanker that led American forces on a weekslong chase across the Atlantic Ocean after being stopped on its way to Venezuela, the first time President Trump’s crackdown on Venezuelan oil has resulted in criminal charges. The captain, Avtandil Kalandadze, was charged with two federal crimes, according to the Feb. 12 indictment, which has not previously been reported. The first count accused Mr. Kalandadze of falsely flying the flag of Guyana on the tanker — the ship was not registered in that country — in an attempt to evade being seized by the U.S. Coast Guard on Dec. 20. The second accuses Mr. Kalandadze of failing to obey an order from the Coast Guard to stop the tanker and allow U.S. forces to board it. Instead, the ship, then known as Bella 1, which had been sailing in the Caribbean Sea toward Venezuela, turned back into the Atlantic, chased by U.S. forces. Along the way, the ship changed its name to Marinera and claimed Russian protection. Its crew painted a Russian flag on the tanker’s side, and it was registered in Russia’s official ship database . The Russian government used diplomatic channels to request that the United States stop chasing the tanker. But U.S. forces boarded and seized the ship on Jan. 7, near the United Kingdom, detaining Mr. Kalandadze and the rest of the crew. The seizure of the ship was part of Mr. Trump’s attempt to take control of Venezuela’s multi-billion-dollar oil industry. So far, the United States has boarded eight other vessels involved in the Venezuelan oil trade. The ships are part of a so-called ghost fleet transporting oil from Venezuela, Iran or Russia around the globe in violation of sanctions placed by the United States and other countries. U.S. authorities had obtained a seizure warrant for the Bella 1 based on its history of transporting Iranian oil for groups linked to terrorism. After the ship was seized, Mr. Kalandadze’s wife, Natia Dzadzama, initiated an unsuccessful legal challenge in the United Kingdom, seeking a judicial review of her husband’s detention, according to local media reports. Aamer Anwar, a lawyer for Ms. Dzadzama, said in a statement on Tuesday that “the U.S. has once again shown a total disregard for the rule of law and international obligations with its closest ally, the U.K.” The White House and the Justice Department did not immediately reply to requests for comment. The BBC reported last month that the United States planned to charge another member of the crew but had released the remaining 26 crew members. Note: The International Maritime Organization issues an IMO number, a permanent identification number, that remains associated with a vessel throughout its lifetime unlike a ship’s name, which can change frequently. The ship in this article is 9230880, known as Marinera, or previously as Bella 1.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Revelations about ties to Jeffrey Epstein have toppled leaders of corporate America, Hollywood and academia as the Justice Department has released millions of documents and images from the disgraced financier’s files in recent months. But the Trump administration has steadfastly repelled such fallout, dismissing any associations that top officials had with the sex offender as trivial. The White House’s fortress mentality was mobilized last week after Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, acknowledged that he had traveled to Mr. Epstein’s private island and had another encounter with him years after Mr. Lutnick claimed to have cut ties with him. Such associations have led to the resignations of business leaders, but President Trump’s White House was unfazed. The stark contrast underscores the murky nature of who is deemed to be complicit and who is not when it comes to Mr. Epstein, and the Trump administration’s ability to repel even the most harsh public scrutiny. Despite bipartisan calls for Mr. Lutnick’s resignation, the White House dismissed concerns about his character and credibility. “Secretary Lutnick remains a very important member of President Trump’s team, and the president fully supports the secretary,” Karoline Leavitt, White House press secretary, said last week. Mr. Lutnick’s comments during Senate testimony contradicted his assertion on a podcast last year that he had been so disgusted by Mr. Epstein during a 2005 visit to his townhouse that Mr. Lutnick never set foot in a room with Mr. Epstein again. Mr. Lutnick’s name appeared in more than 250 documents in the Epstein files released by the Justice Department, a review by The New York Times found. He said that he first met Mr. Epstein when they became neighbors in Manhattan in 2005, but that they met only twice more over the next 14 years that he could recall. However, at the Senate hearing Mr. Lutnick confirmed that he and his family traveled to the island in 2012 for a lunch with Mr. Epstein during a vacation aboard his yacht with his wife, children, nannies and another family. The visit took place four years after Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida to soliciting prostitution from a minor as part of a deal with federal prosecutors. Mr. Lutnick is not the only prominent Trump administration official who has appeared in the Epstein documents. The records showed that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, once went hunting for dinosaur fossils with Mr. Epstein. An email in the files showed that Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, invited Mr. Epstein to a 2016 Valentine’s Day party. The Trump administration’s muted response is a striking departure from that of corporate America. Thomas J. Pritzker, a billionaire heir to the Hyatt Hotels fortune , stepped down from his role Monday as executive chairman of the Hyatt Hotels Corporation. Last week, Casey Wasserman, a Los Angeles entertainment executive and chair of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics whose name recently surfaced in the Epstein files, said he had started the process of selling the talent agency he founded more than two decades ago. And last year, Harvard started a new review of ties that its former president Lawrence H. Summers and others at the institution had with Mr. Epstein. After the release of emails between Mr. Summers and Mr. Epstein in November, Mr. Summers said he would step back from public commitments . “Corporate America, they answer to a board,” said Gene Grabowski, a Washington-based crisis communications expert. “Trump doesn’t answer to a board.” Mr. Grabowski added: “The closest thing he has is the voters, and he either doesn’t want to believe the polls or thinks he can reverse them.” A poll conducted last month by The New York Times and Siena University showed that Mr. Trump’s lowest approval rating within the Republican Party came on his handling of the release of files related to Mr. Epstein: Only 53 percent of Republicans approved of his handling of that matter. Mr. Lutnick’s ties to Mr. Epstein pale when compared with those of Mr. Trump, who socialized regularly with Mr. Epstein in the 1990s and 2000s . Using a proprietary search tool, The Times identified more than 5,300 files containing more than 38,000 references to Mr. Trump, his wife, his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, and other related words and phrases in the latest batch of emails, government files, videos and other records released by the Justice Department. Mr. Trump has downplayed his association with Mr. Epstein and accused Democrats of concocting conspiracy theories about their friendship. The president said last summer that he had ended his relationship with the financier because Mr. Epstein had “hired away” spa attendants at Mar-a-Lago. In defending Mr. Lutnick, the White House is again pushing the boundaries of its ability to weather a controversy that might have hobbled other administrations. “This administration has placed all its chips on the idea that the public will eventually tire of controversy, and now they’re betting that even allegations tied to pedophilia fall into that same bucket,” said Alexandra LaManna, who served as a spokeswoman in the Biden administration. “That’s a category of accusation that, historically, has been politically and morally radioactive.” Noting that Mr. Lutnick vacationed on Mr. Epstein’s island, she added: “It’s hard to imagine any president other than Trump trying to shrug that off.” Alan Rappeport is an economic policy reporter for The Times, based in Washington.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the election of Barack Obama, died on Tuesday . He was 84. In a statement, his family said that Mr. Jackson “died peacefully,” but did not give a cause. Mr. Jackson, who was celebrated for his impassioned oratory and populist vision of a “rainbow coalition” of the poor and forgotten, picked up the mantle of Dr. King after his assassination in 1968. He ran for president twice , but he never achieved either the commanding moral stature of Dr. King or the ultimate political triumph attained by Mr. Obama. Tributes flowed in for Mr. Jackson , including from President Trump, who called him “a good man” and a “force of nature,” and former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who described him as “a man of God and of the people.” The Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader, described Mr. Jackson as his mentor. “He was a consequential and transformative leader who changed this nation and the world,” Mr. Sharpton said in a statement.

Credit... Kamil Krzaczynski/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images By the early afternoon on Tuesday, mourners had left around half a dozen bouquets of flowers and a few balloons outside of the Rev. Jesse Jackson’s Tudor-style house on Constance Avenue in the South Shore neighborhood. Next door, Junelle Speller said she had bought her home because she fell in love with the house, but living beside Mr. Jackson was a wonderful bonus. “It was always surreal for us to be living next door to a civil rights icon, someone my husband and I both studied in school here in Chicago,” Mrs. Speller said. Despite Mr. Jackson’s larger-than-life persona and soaring oratory skills, Mrs. Speller soon discovered that in person the civil rights leader “was very grounded, very down to earth, approachable, personable and vibrant.” “He had a deliberate but very inspirational way of speaking,” she said. “You’d be kind of awestruck. But he was at your level, meeting you and sharing those stories, providing motivation for this period of time, for the African American community.” Anita O’Neal, 67, stopped by the Jackson home and showed reporters gathered outside the house a wrinkled photo of herself from 1968. She was 11 years old in the picture, wearing a prim, white outfit for a flight from Chicago to Cape Girardeau, Mo. Sitting in a seat and looking up at her is a young Mr. Jackson, who at the time was a protégé of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Ms. O’Neal said she had come to appreciate the experience only later on in life. “I read about who he was and understood who he was. It was quite an honor for me,” she said. Image Anita O’Neal shows a photo of herself with Jesse Jackson when she was 11 years old. Credit... Nam Y. Huh/Associated Press Ms. O’Neal recalled Mr. Jackson’s quieter side. When he would attend services at St. Sabina Church in the Auburn Gresham neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side, he wouldn’t draw attention to himself, she said. “He wouldn’t come with fanfare,” she said. “He would just walk in, walk down the center aisle, and just go on and sit down.” The pastor, Michael L. Pfleger, would introduce him, she recalled, but Mr. Jackson “didn’t want any recognition. He was there for service.” Joy Jones, 66, said she had come straight to Mr. Jackson’s house after working an overnight shift at a hospital in the Bronzeville neighborhood on the city’s South Side. Still dressed in her purple scrubs, Ms. Jones said she hoped someone would follow in Mr. Jackson’s footsteps just as Mr. Jackson picked up Mr. King’s fight for civil rights after his assassination. “I’m praying that someone will stand up and will continue the movement forward,” Ms. Jones said. “Because it seems this administration is trying to make us take some steps backward, but I really hope that someone — male, female, someone — will stand up and say, ‘We’ve got to keep moving. We’ve got to keep going.’” Among the other Chicagoans who dropped by to pay their respects was Delores Brown, who set down a bouquet of flowers next to the small shrine that had been growing on the Jackson family’s front lawn. He had been a role model, she said, for people in the South Side community where she lived, especially for young Black men. “He’s also been a person that has spoken for us on so many levels when we were not able to speak for ourselves,” she said.

Vest for The New York Times The museum at the Lorraine Motel was closed, typical for a Tuesday. Yet on a cloudy Memphis day, with a cold wind whipping the flags lowered to half-staff, there were still a few people who came to pay their respects outside. On this day, it was not just about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whose assassination on a balcony at the motel on April 4, 1968, defined the city in American history. For at least a couple of visitors, it was a chance to mourn the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who died at 84 on Tuesday and was among the people who witnessed the murder and sought to carry on Dr. King’s civil rights legacy. “I had to be there,” said Theresa Jackson, 56, who had pulled over Tuesday morning, on her way back to Illinois from Biloxi, Miss. Visiting the motel, which is now home to the National Civil Rights Museum , “gave me chills, just the presence of being there.” Across the South, leaders mourned the death of Mr. Jackson, who was born in South Carolina and crisscrossed the region campaigning for civil rights, championing voter registration and making two unsuccessful bids for the presidency. But in Memphis, where Mr. Jackson returned again and again to the site of Dr. King’s assassination, there was a unique grief over the loss of an elder who had inspired the city’s next generation of Black leaders. “He was a fixture,” Mayor Paul Young said in an interview on Tuesday, recounting how as a young student, he voted for Mr. Jackson in a mock presidential election because “he was somebody I could see myself in, that looked like me.” He met Mr. Jackson at the 2024 Democratic National Convention, Mr. Young recalled, and they had a conversation that was both “personal and meaningful.” “I get to serve as mayor today,” Mr. Young said, “tied to the ground that he broke.” Mr. Jackson embodied the connection between Chicago, where he lived, and Memphis, a familiar stop for many Black Americans traveling north. “He almost was sort of like a son of Memphis in many ways,” said State Representative Justin Pearson, who represents Memphis in the Tennessee General Assembly and received a phone call from Mr. Jackson in 2023 after Mr. Pearson’s colleagues had expelled him from the chamber over a gun control protest. “His connection to our city is obviously deeply rooted in sort of the grief of that loss of Dr. King, but also in this desire and willingness to see our city thrive, to become a better place,” Mr. Pearson added. Mr. Jackson built a partnership with Stax Records , a prominent Memphis institution , spreading his message as a signed, spoken-word recording artist. He spoke at churches and schools, stopped at the occasional barbecue j",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Representative Randy Fine, Republican of Florida, on Tuesday faced a barrage of calls for his resignation from Democrats — and silence from Republican leaders — after making an Islamophobic statement suggesting he prefers dogs to Muslims. Mr. Fine, a Jewish first-term congressman who was known in the Florida Legislature as “The Hebrew Hammer” and often makes Islamophobic remarks on social media, made the statement in question on Sunday in response to a post from a Palestinian activist based in New York City. Nerdeen Kiswani, a Palestinian Muslim New Yorker and organizer, said in a social media post that dung-filled snowdrifts in the city proved that dogs should not have a place in society as indoor pets because, she wrote, “like we’ve said all along, they are unclean.” Mr. Fine responded: “If they force us to choose, the choice between dogs and Muslims is not a difficult one.” The comment prompted immediate and unequivocal condemnation from Democrats. Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said that Mr. Fine “is a disgrace to the United States Congress. He is an Islamophobic, disgusting and unrepentant bigot.” Mr. Jeffries added that it was “unacceptable that Mike Johnson and House Republicans continue to remain silent,” referring to the speaker. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, the reigning Democratic king of trolling Republicans online, wrote bluntly, “Resign now, you racist slob.” Many House Democrats called for Mr. Fine to be stripped of his committee assignments. But Mr. Johnson remained silent, and Mr. Fine doubled down in response to the backlash. “My post was in response to a major Muslim leader saying dogs should be forbidden from New York City because to some Muslims, it bothers them,” Mr. Fine said in an appearance on Newsmax. “If they’re going to make us choose between our dogs and them going home, the choice is easy.” One of the few conservatives who criticized Mr. Fine publicly was Megyn Kelly, the podcast host, who wrote in an online post that “instead of attacking the person or the policy, you went full bigot.” On social media, Ms. Kiswani called Mr. Fine a “rabid Zionist” who used her words “as an excuse to post genocidal rhetoric against Muslims.” In a follow-up email to The New York Times, Ms. Kiswani said that she had intended her words to land as a “mild, satirical” post, and viewed Mr. Fine’s response as reflective of a political climate in which “anti-Palestinian and anti-Muslim bigotry is normalized and hostility toward our communities is more easily justified.” She said her post was misinterpreted and used as “grounds for days of attacks, threats and widespread misinformation, including inaccurate claims that I am part of Mayor Mamdani’s administration.” Mr. Fine has referred to both Muslim women in Congress as “terrorists.” In a post in May, he addressed Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, who had accused the Israeli government of starving Gazans, saying she should “tell your fellow Muslim terrorists to release the hostages and surrender. Until then, #StarveAway.” In July, Mr. Fine called Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, a “terrorist” after she appeared to refer to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel as a war criminal. “I’m sure it is difficult to see us welcome the killer of so many of your fellow Muslim terrorists,” he wrote online, referring to Ms. Omar. “The only shame is that you serve in Congress.” At the time, House Democratic leaders condemned his comment. Mr. Johnson never did. Annie Karni is a congressional correspondent for The Times.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The White House on Tuesday rejected the latest offer from Democratic lawmakers on proposed new constraints on federal immigration officers, the latest sign that there would not be a quick resolution of the stalemate that has left the Department of Homeland Security without funding since Saturday. A White House official who provided a statement on the condition of anonymity to describe private negotiations said the two parties were still far apart, adding that President Trump’s team remained interested in continuing good-faith talks to resolve the impasse. In response, aides for the Democratic leaders in Congress said that Republicans had largely ignored the guardrails the public was demanding, and urged them to start negotiating in good faith as they said their side had been doing. Both White House officials and Democrats on Capitol Hill have kept largely confidential the specifics of their offers to end the standoff that allowed funding for the agency to lapse as of 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The outlines of the Democratic demands, however, are well known: limits on masked police, an end to random sweeps, new requirements for judicial warrants, putting “sensitive locations” such as churches, schools, hospitals and polling places off limits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement among them. The offer was given to the White House Monday evening but brushed aside by the White House less than 24 hours later. “These are common sense,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said Sunday on CNN about the Democratic proposals. “Police departments across America use them. We have a rogue agency. Why don’t we rein them in? That’s what the American people are asking Republicans.” Democrats have portrayed the earlier White House counteroffer to Democrats, which has not been made public, as “nonserious.” People familiar with the talks have said that the White House has not been responsive to many of the Democratic demands for limits on federal immigration agents, and has pushed for new authority of its own, including increased penalties for those who dox officers. Some Republicans have also said that they want an end to local and state policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, sometimes called sanctuary city policies, in exchange for concessions. “When it comes to masks, I don’t know of another law enforcement agency in the country that has an 8,000-percent increase in threats,” Tom Homan, President Trump’s border czar, said Sunday on CBS News’s “Face the Nation.” “Just yesterday, the director of ICE, his wife was filmed walking to work. His home address has been doxed. His kids have been doxed and filmed.” With Congress on a weeklong recess and lawmakers scattered around the world and the nation, chances for approval of a funding agreement this week remained remote since members would have to return to Washington to pass it and the negotiations were not showing any movement. Democrats made clear they intended to stick to their demands and did not appear to be uneasy about any political backlash for blocking money for the agency that also funds airport security, the Coast Guard and disaster relief. “We need change that is dramatic, that is bold, that is meaningful and that is transformational,” Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the House minority leader, said on CBS. “For instance, judicial warrants should be required before ICE agents can storm private property or rip everyday Americans out of their homes.” Many of the Department of Homeland Security’s workers remain on the job but run the risk of missing a paycheck if the funding fight drags on. Mr. Trump is scheduled to deliver the first formal State of the Union address of his second term before Congress next Tuesday. Without some breakthrough, he will make the speech before Congress with one agency without a congressional appropriation for the year, though ICE has a separate pot of money from an earlier measure that can keep it operating.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Long before mechanical lifts, snow machines or winter resorts with après-ski comforts, hardy Alpine people trudged up icy peaks under their own power, not for sport but because it was the only way to get around. It was a necessity of rugged mountain life: Merchants wore skis to trade goods, and soldiers wore skis to fight battles. That tradition, once essential for survival, is at the heart of ski mountaineering, which makes its debut as an Olympic event on Thursday in some of the same mountains where the sport was born. In skimo, as it is known to its devotees, competitors climb uphill on skis and then on foot before racing downhill. It is a punishing exercise that requires strength, technique and endurance, which is exactly why ski mountaineers love it. “You have to be powerful, explosive, fast, and also be able to repeat these climbs over and over again,” said Cameron Smith, who is the most decorated American ski mountaineer and one of two U.S. athletes competing this week at the Winter Games in Northern Italy. “So it’s a super physically demanding sport.” Skimo is the first new Olympic winter sport since snowboarding in 1998. ( Skeleton debuted in the 1920s before becoming a fixture at the Games in 2002.) Organizers have not announced whether skimo will be included in the 2030 Games in the French Alps, but supporters of the sport say its roots and popularity in Italy, France and Switzerland help its chances. Image The transition from skiing to moving on foot can make or break an athlete’s race. Credit... Jonathon Selkowitz for The New York Times The sport is relatively young in the United States, but the International Ski Mountaineering Federation is also working to secure a spot for the event at the 2034 Winter Games in Utah. An early American champion was Nina Silitch, who embraced the sport while living in France and won two gold medals in skimo World Cups, including the first medal in the event for a North American. After returning to the United States, she founded a skimo club in Park City, Utah, and worked to expand the sport, with an eye on getting it into the Winter Games. “Slowly, these youth programs started to build support from parents and then create that structure in North America,” she said. “For it to be in the Olympics is the result of lots of people who are passionate about the sport being committed.” Smith and his U.S. teammate, Anna Gibson, qualified for this year’s Olympics after an unexpectedly dominant performance won them first place in a mixed relay World Cup event in December. Besides the mixed relay, the Olympics will have men’s and women’s individual sprints. In the sprints, competitors climb up the course on skis, take them off to continue on foot and then put the skis back on to make the final ascent, reaching a height of about 230 feet. Then they race downhill. Each sprint takes about three minutes. In the mixed relay, the female member of the pair completes two ascents, reaching 400 to 500 feet, and two descents before the male athlete goes through the same course. Then they each repeat it. That race takes about 30 minutes. One tip for viewers at home: Watch the athletes’ transitions from climbing uphill on skis to going on foot to getting back on skis and then going downhill. Racers affix skins to the bottoms of their skis to provide traction as they ascend, then must take them off and reattach their skis before heading back down. Image Skins on the bottoms of the skis help with traction on the ascent. Credit... Angelika Warmuth/Reuters Races are often won or lost based on how nimbly athletes handle the transitions, Smith said. Competitors devote part of their training exclusively to those moments, he added, describing creative setups using yoga mats and uneven steps in an effort to mimic course conditions. In warmer months, many ski mountaineers are trail runners or cyclists. The three sports share similar physical requirements, train similar muscles and fulfill a similar desire to move freely through mountains at any time of year. Smith said he got hooked on skimo in part because he could “access places that, once they’re covered in feet of snow, normally are really hard to get to.” Some of the highest peaks of the Italian Alps around the town of Bormio are so snowy that ski mountaineers are able to practice six months a year, said Marco Colombo, who is a local ski mountaineer and guide. The roughly 15-mile Stelvio Pass, the shortest route by car to neighboring Switzerland, is closed in winter. The pass, above the ski center course of the same name that will be used in Olympic skimo, is one of the places where Italian and Austro-Hungarian soldiers fought on skis during World War I, in brutal, high-altitude combat that became known as the White War. Italy’s three Olympic ski mountaineers live in nearby Albosaggia, population 3,000, where a local sports academy has nurtured young people in the sport. “There has always been a great tradition here since the postwar period,” said Alessandro Piani, the president of the academy, Polisportiva Albosaggia, which enrolls about 350 children in a range of mountain sports, including skiing and cycling. He cited the closure of many small ski lifts in the area, which forced locals to figure out how to get up the mountains under their own power. Image The women’s sprint race at the Ski Mountaineering World Cup event in Bormio, Italy, in February 2025. Credit... Antonio Calanni/Associated Press But ski climbing in pristine backwoods can be treacherous, so building the sport in places like Bormio has required clearing space for trails in snowy areas near existing downhill slopes. Colombo, the guide, helped lead a project with the local tourism bureau, where he now works, to create five skimo trails close to the foot of the Stelvio ski course. One of the practical challenges his team faced was striking a deal between go-it-alone ski mountaineers and ski lift operators, who typically charge to take skiers up the mountain and use those funds to pay for the slopes’ upkeep. The compromise was a seasonal pass that charges ski mountaineers for one lift ride a day so they can practice high up in the mountains early in winter, when there is usually not enough snow to climb up from the foothills. Smith, the American ski mountaineer, said he hopes that the sport becomes more popular as more people are exposed to it. He acknowledged that a lot of people he knows don’t understand the discipline he competes in. “Now that it’s in the Olympics, people I grew up with — youth sports coaches, people I’ve worked with — are starting to understand it,” he said. “And get more excited about it.” Patricia Mazzei is the lead reporter for The Times in Miami, covering Florida and Puerto Rico.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Uber said on Wednesday that it would offer incentives to other companies to install electric vehicle chargers in the United States and Europe, a potential boost for a part of the car market that has been hurt by recent U.S. policy changes. The company said it would guarantee that chargers installed in neighborhoods where its drivers lived or often picked up or dropped off passengers would be used a minimum amount of time. The offer should allow charging operators to more quickly recoup their investment in new stations. How much chargers are used is a key to whether they make or lose money but difficult to predict. Sales of electric vehicles have slumped in the United States after Republicans in Congress and President Trump revoked various policies intended to encourage sales of cars with no tailpipe emissions. But construction of charging stations grew at a record pace last year despite the policy shift, in part because of Uber drivers like Charles Iwuoha, one of 13,000 ride-share drivers who use electric vehicles in New York City. He bought a Kia EV9, an electric sport utility vehicle, last year with financial help from Uber. The car’s battery lasts a full 10-hour shift, he said. And it costs him $20 to $40 less to charge the car than refueling the gasoline vehicle he previously owned. That is a significant savings, said Mr. Iwuoha, who lives in Queens. “New York rent is too high,” he said. Driving an Uber “pays the bills, but you’re just scraping by.” Ride-share drivers are among the heaviest users of public chargers, especially the kinds of devices that can top up a battery in half an hour or less, according to analysts and charging companies. The money that drivers for Uber, Lyft and other ride-hailing services pay to charge cars is a big reason for the growth in the number of charging stations. But chargers are not always built where Uber drivers need them. Mr. Iwuoha, for example, lives in an apartment building and cannot charge at home. He is dependent on fast public chargers, which are often crowded, especially in Manhattan. Pradeep Parameswaran, Uber’s global head of mobility, said his company hoped to alleviate some of those problems by getting 1,000 chargers built. “Over time, we think electrification helps bring down the cost of running their business on Uber,” he said in an interview. “And ultimately, it’s good for cities. It brings down emissions.” Jeroen van Tilburg, the chief executive of Ionity, a European charging company that is working with Uber, said Uber’s data would help it identify the best places to build chargers. “The biggest concern for every charge point operator is to identify the right location,” Mr. van Tilburg said. The stations built with Uber’s support will be open to anyone and could be particularly useful to renters and other urban residents who cannot charge at home. Uber said it was hoping to encourage new stations in New York, Los Angeles, Boston, San Francisco, London, Paris and Madrid. Uber also said on Wednesday that it would spend $100 million to build charging hubs for autonomous vehicles, which are almost always electric. Uber, whose business is potentially threatened by self-driving taxis, has been trying to position itself as a partner to companies like Waymo, a unit of Alphabet, Google’s parent company. In Austin, Texas, for example, Uber provides charging, cleaning and maintenance for Waymo’s taxis. Despite headwinds from Washington, the number of chargers in the United States increased 30 percent last year to 70,000 ports, according to Paren, a research firm that specializes in electric vehicle charging. That included a 44 percent increase in the last three months of the year, when electric vehicle sales plummeted after a tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of such models ended. Early figures for 2026 showed that growth remains strong, said Florent Breton, the chief executive of Paren. That is despite obstacles thrown up by the Trump administration. Last week, Sean Duffy, the secretary of transportation, proposed a rule that would require that chargers contain no parts manufactured outside the United States in order to receive federal funding under a program passed during the Biden administration. Electric vehicle experts say that’s an impossible standard to meet. But the practical effect of that proposal is limited because the large majority of chargers being installed in the United States receive no federal funding. Ride-share drivers are a big reason that demand for charging remains strong. Their cars account for about one quarter of the energy dispensed by EVgo, the third-largest U.S. operator of charging stations and an Uber partner. That compares with about 10 percent in 2021. “Electrification of ride share is something that we’ve been seeing quarter after quarter, year after year, for several years now,” Badar Khan, the chief executive of EVgo, said in an interview. “Anything that we can do in our partnership with Uber to increase the rollout of infrastructure will just accelerate the adoption of electrical vehicles.” Charging has become one of the main obstacles to buying an electric vehicle, according to drivers surveyed by Uber. Used electric vehicles sell for less than comparable gasoline models and are generally cheaper to fuel and maintain, according to calculations by the company. New electric vehicles cost more, but the gap is narrowing. Uber also offers drivers a $4,000 grant they can use to buy electric vehicles. (Drivers must log at least 100 trips to qualify.) Mr. Iwuoha, the Uber driver, said he had chosen an electric car in part because he was concerned about the environment, and in anticipation of New York regulations that will require all ride-share vehicles to be zero emission or handicapped accessible by 2030. He bought his Kia new before the $7,500 federal tax credit expired. If it were up to him, chargers would be available in the parking lots of public parks and at many more gas stations. “Time is money,” Mr. Iwuoha said.

Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 8:42 min Learn more Share full article By Carlotta Gall and Hussam Hammoud Photographs by Nanna Heitmann A team of New York Times reporters and a photographer spent two weeks in northeastern Syria and visited three detention facilities. Feb. 18, 2026 Orange jump suits lay strewed on the ground, dropped in a trail as the prisoners made their escape, the only sign left of the former inmates. The guards’ quarters were abandoned and the prison gates swung in the wind. The prison break in January just outside the town of Shadaddi in northeastern Syria was a stark example of the sudden change of power that has upended a system of two dozen high-security prisons holding thousands of members of the terrorist group the Islamic State. In recent weeks, Syrian government forces seized control of a wide swath of territory in northeastern Syria from the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., a Kurdish-led force that had worked for years with a U.S.-led coalition to combat the Islamic State and to guard camps and prisons. The change has now made the problem of the prisoners one for President Ahmed al-Sharaa, testing his commitment to fighting extremism. It has also forced a rapid recalculation by the U.S.-led coalition and many other states of what to do with the thousands of detainees and families held in prisons and camps since the defeat of the Islamic State in 2019. Shortly after the breakout at Shadaddi prison on Jan. 19, the U.S. military began a complex operation to transfer thousands of adult male detainees to detention facilities in Iraq, starting with those considered the most dangerous. The Syrian government took control of several prisons and detention camps, including Shadaddi prison and a sprawling camp known as Al Hol, which housed more than 20,000 women and children, some displaced by the war but many of them families of fighters from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. A team from The New York Times visited both facilities earlier this month. Shadaddi was deserted. In Al Hol, entire sections of the camp appeared uninhabited, with tents in shreds and a school building in one section abandoned. The Syrian government has made it clear that it would not continue to run the prison system the way it had been. After it took over Al Hol, it allowed thousands to leave and announced on Tuesday that it had evacuated or relocated the last families from the camp. “Al Hol includes many families who are not ISIS,” including women and children displaced by the war, Badri al-Masloukh, the deputy governor of nearby Deir al Zour Province, said in an interview. “Keeping them there is not a solution.” But the government also blamed the S.D.F. for withdrawing from Al Hol without coordinating a handover of the camp. Government forces arrived 10 hours after the S.D.F. had left, which it said created a security vacuum that allowed hundreds of families to escape. Image Women and children at Al Hol this month. In the chaos, the Islamic State was primed and ready to break out some of its members, according to Bashar Hassan, an independent researcher in Syria who follows the group. The Islamic State had sleeper cells in Syria, but operatives also arrived from Iraq around Jan. 19, apparently to take advantage of the disarray, he said. “That mess was useful to them,” he said. “The first thing they focused on was seizing weapons.” A map of Syria highlighting Shadaddi.

SYRIA LEBANON IRAQ Damascus JORDAN 100 Miles Mr. Hassan saw a lot of chatter on ISIS communication channels and media statements, he said, confirmed by his own sources close to the movement. Those who escaped included a woman, known as Um Fahad, who was considered the leader of ISIS families in the camp. Mr. Hassan showed a reporter posts about Um Fahad’s escape on a private ISIS chat group. “There was a lot of congratulating each other,” he said. There were also Lebanese families who were known to have been in Al Hol and who were celebrating their return recently on a social media group, he said. Those early breakouts from Al Hol were aimed at freeing specific families, which indicated a level of planning by ISIS, as did the swift travel of families across the border into Lebanon, Mr. Hassan said. “How did they reach Lebanon?” he said. “It is more than 800 kilometers, so it indicates that something organized happened. It was not just accidental.” Image An Iraqi family in Al Hol Camp this month. Many Iraqis have been repatriated, but some of those in the camp said they feared going home and were hoping to be resettled in Syria. Aid organizations that worked at Al Hol warned that the sudden mass departure raised a host of security questions, not just about those who had escaped but also about whether some in the Syrian security forces helped open the gates for the detainees. President al-Sharaa, who led a group affiliated with Al Qaeda in Syria during the civil war, has been accused of harboring extremists and Islamists who sympathize with ISIS in his own ranks. Government officials have denied that, saying that the government has come under attack from ISIS members and that it is sincere in its opposition to the group. A vast camp, Al Hol is divided into sections, with the annex housing 6,000 women and children who were neither from Syria nor Iraq. The majority were Chinese, Russians and Turks. Aid workers visiting the camp in recent days said the annex had been emptied out. The government said it was monitoring the families of ISIS fighters with foreign nationalities who had left the camp to head off any potential security threats. There was a steady flow of Syrian and Iraqi families leaving the camp, helped by a convoy of vans, pickups and buses up until last weekend. A post on an Al Hol chat group on Telegram on Sunday described families camped on the roads begging rides and friends and volunteers helping them return to their families. Image Entire sections of the Al Hol camp appeared abandoned this month. It once held more than 20,000 women and children, some displaced by the war but many of them families of ISIS members. One guard said the government had organized what he described as large-scale evacuations of inmates in recent days. According to him, about 5,000 women and children were evacuated in buses from Feb. 7 to Feb. 9 to camps in Idlib Province in northwestern Syria. Others thought to have links to ISIS were being transported to another camp in Aleppo Province, he said. Syrian inmates, who include people displaced by the war, were being released if a relative came to vouch for them, he said. One relative was allowed inside to help them pack up their belongings and dismantle their tent, he said. The guard denied that there was much smuggling of inmates, saying that two smugglers who had tried to take out people had been arrested. The guard spoke on the condition that his name not be published because he was not allowed to talk to the media. Image A member of Syrian General Security forces patrols inside Al Hol camp. At Shadaddi prison, there were some signs that the breakout had occurred with outside help. The outer camp occupied by guards showed no sign of fighting or violence, but bullet holes on two sets of inner metal gates indicated that people had shot out the locks from the outside. The Syrian government played down the importance of the breakout, saying it had recaptured all but 20 of the escapees. The American operation that unfolded in the days after took place under heavy security.

Halbfinger reported from Jerusalem, and Bilal Shbair from Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip. Feb. 18, 2026 In the midst of a crowded camp for displaced Palestinians in southern Gaza, a gate with a jarringly upbeat poster of a bright red cartoon racing car sticks out. Inside, a passageway to a compound of tent classrooms is adorned with children’s drawings more reflective of real life. One shows an orange and yellow home, green grass and olive trees over the handwritten words “I had a house, but today I have nothing.” Raseel al-Shaer, 12, pauses to tell a visitor how good it feels to be learning alongside other children again in al-Mawasi. “Here, it is safe,” she says. “No drones or bombs. The best thing is sitting at a desk and seeing the teacher and the board, and holding a pencil again.” Quietly, and despite considerable risk, a network of free private schools for war orphans and other children has sprouted in the Gaza Strip. The schools, called Academies of Hope, are the brainchild of a Palestinian American neurosurgeon, Dr. David Hasan, who first visited Gaza on medical relief missions soon after Israel invaded Gaza in the wake of the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023. Image “No drones or bombs,” one student said. “The best thing is sitting at a desk and seeing the teacher and the board, and holding a pencil again.” Image Some 9,000 pupils in grades one through nine attend classes in five areas across southern Gaza. Though he hasn’t been back to Gaza since early 2024, he has built the institutions by forging partnerships with humanitarian groups on the ground, hiring Palestinian staff over WhatsApp and raising money — largely from Jewish donors — in the United States and Israel. Some 9,000 pupils in grades one through nine are attending classes in five campuses in southern Gaza. They cycle through the schools in three-hour shifts and receive hot meals and medical and psychological care. Operating schools in any war zone is hard enough, and schools across the enclave are struggling to rebuild. But Dr. Hasan has compounded his challenges. He revamped a much-criticized national curriculum and worked to keep Hamas from endangering his schools. He also verifies that none of his staff have ties to militant groups, a charge Israel has leveled against the United Nations agency caring for Palestinians in Gaza and some international aid groups. The schools teach a modified version of the Palestinian Authority’s curriculum, which is taught in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza, but without any lessons demonizing Jews or glorifying perpetrators of violence against Israel. Dr. Hasan said the curriculum changes were made without the authority’s permission, prompting threats of reprisal from its education ministry. A ministry spokesman did not respond to repeated messages seeking comment. Image Most children in Gaza have been out of school for more than two years. Image Some of the drawings made by the children, with a picture of Dr. David Hasan in the middle. Israel, the United States and the European Union have long complained that the authority’s textbooks inculcate hatred and antisemitism. The authority says that its schools appropriately teach Palestinian nationalism, history and culture. Before-and-after excerpts from the curriculum illustrate the changes: A math problem comparing the number of “martyrs” killed in the first and second intifadas has been replaced with one involving attendance at a West Bank soccer match. A reading comprehension selection praising Dalal Mughrabi — a woman who led a 1978 massacre that killed 38 Israelis, 13 of them children — has been replaced with one about Hind al-Husseini, a pioneering Palestinian educator. And in an Islamic studies class, a reading about an attempt by Jews to kill the Prophet Muhammad has been replaced with one about the prophet’s expressions of respect for Jews. Dr. Hasan’s team also added new weekly lessons on “peace building” that teach ideals like tolerance and respect for differences, the golden rule and conflict resolution. In a video recorded by a school employee during one lesson recently, a boy draws pictures of the Palestinian and Israeli flags side by side. “I wish there will be no more wars so that we can live,” he says. Video The children cycle through the schools in three-hour shifts and receive hot meals and medical and psychological care. Image Dr. Hasan, in red cap, operating during his time volunteering in Gaza. Credit... via Dr. David Hasan Dr. Hasan acknowledged that his peace-building curriculum was politically fraught and that some of his teachers were fearful of blowback from Hamas as it re-establishes its control over much of Gaza. Some faculty members have quit or been fired over such concerns, he said. He said he was even exploring installing cameras in classrooms to ensure that the curriculum changes are upheld. On social media, some Gazans have asked whether Dr. Hasan’s agenda is overly aligned with Israel’s. Others, embittered by Hamas, have retorted that it’s better to teach tolerance than to teach children to sacrifice themselves. Discomfort with the subject was clear in interviews with faculty members, most of whom had not been hired from other schools — they were either teaching for the first time or were retired principals. They emphasized that they were using the standard Palestinian curriculum, though when pressed, acknowledged some deletions. Alaa Sabbah, 35, who was guiding a class through the basic components of a cell, said he wasn’t teaching only science. “We teach respect, tolerance and accepting others,” he said. “We teach them how to rise again, like a phoenix, and how to come back to life from under the rubble. We teach them to love people and to socialize.” When the first school opened last July, Dr. Hasan said he gave the Israeli military the school’s coordinates, hoping to protect it. In August, the staff received a warning of an Israeli attack and evacuated. An airstrike soon after hit militants next door. The school suffered little damage but soon found a new site, Dr. Hasan said. That first school had space for 200 students, he said. On the first day, 500 showed up. “Some hadn’t had food for days,” he said. “The kids were so excited — for the first time they were thriving,” he added. “And they didn’t want to go home. We had to kick them out in the evening.” Image Students receiving a meal before they head home at the end of their school day. Image A nurse examining a student. Last summer, as malnutrition was taking hold under an Israeli blockade, Dr. Hasan said, he bought tons of flour on the black market for people living in Deir al-Balah. Having earned the gratitude of local elders, he said, he persuaded them to give him space for a school. Since then, he said, leaders of big families in Gaza have helped him obtain space for more schools. “The way we did it is by gaining trust,” he said. One way is by ensuring those families — as well as the Israelis and his donors — that his staff has no ties to militant groups. Dr. Hasan said that every employee had been cleared with the Israeli authorities and checked against a U.S. government sanctions list. He also makes clear that his donors include Israelis. “I told the elders, ‘I work with the Israelis,’” he said. “They said, ‘As long as they don’t want to brainwash our kids, we’re fine.’” A researcher and professor at Duke University’s medical school, Dr. Hasan, 53, had no background in humanitarian aid before the 2023 attack. Nor was he particularly connected to Palestinian life. Born in Kuwait to Palestinians from the West Bank, he left the Middle East at 18 to attend college in Texas. At 19, he dropped h",

Feb. 18, 2026 Highway 1 was once among the most dangerous, damaged arteries in Afghanistan. But on a recent 300-mile road trip between Afghanistan’s two largest cities, Times journalists only encountered order and security — and not a single pothole. Since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021, they have worked to replace the violence that largely defined this highway, and the country, with strengthened security and administration. Once littered with bomb craters and trenches dug by overweight trucks, the road is now smooth enough for travelers to nap while riding through the barren plains of Afghanistan’s east.

This is the Afghanistan that the Taliban government has rebuilt over the past four and a half years, after the United States withdrawal. It is what the Taliban want the world to see as they try to attract foreign investment and recognition. There is order, security and signs of an economic rebound, they say. The Afghan economy grew by 4.3 percent last year, according to the World Bank, up from 2.5 percent in 2024. Video Order, security and signs of economic activity: This is the Afghanistan that the Taliban government wants the world to see as it tries to attract foreign investment and recognition. “All the heavy weapons and the money of the previous government didn’t accomplish much,” said Iqbal Noori, the owner of a mobile phone shop in Kandahar, Afghanistan’s second-largest city. “We have to trust the Taliban. We don’t have another option.” Highway 1 was once the showpiece of the U.S. reconstruction effort in Afghanistan. But it also became a symbol of squandered billions in Western aid. In 2016, an audit by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction found that 95 percent of the paved roads had been damaged or destroyed. Amid frequent fighting, the 300-mile trip between Kabul and Kandahar could stretch to 18 hours. Travelers can now complete the journey in eight.

They are erecting a mosque every 40 miles and urging real estate developers to build around them. In the evening, we stopped at a roadside stall where Nasibullah Khaksar sold almonds and dried apricots. Growing up next to Highway 1 meant a life of constant interruption, where playing outside or going to school was often impossible. “The sight of a Taliban patrol was a sign that fighting would start soon,” he said. Now, Mr. Khaksar said, he can ride his motorcycle at night without fear, and he never locks his shop. The fields nearby are just fields, not battlefields. Image Flashy gas stations are a common sight among Highway 1. As the Taliban are erecting a mosque every 40 miles, they are also urging real estate developers to build gas stations, restaurants and hotels around them. But the flawless asphalt can be a thin veneer. From the hills, the road looks like a lonely snake cutting through a parched landscape. Farmers say their fields have grown barren because of drought and contaminated groundwater. Women and girls were all but invisible on the journey save for a few glimpsed in the back of passing taxis and buses. The Taliban have effectively erased them from public life, banning them from most jobs and school beyond sixth grade, and forbidding them to travel long distances without a male companion. The Afghan economy may be losing $1.4 billion every year because of it, according to World Bank estimates .

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Ukrainian and Russian officials wrapped up a new round of U.S.-mediated peace talks on Wednesday after a second day of discussions that lasted just two hours, a brief session that suggested little progress was achieved and underscored that a deal remains elusive as fighting rages on the battlefield. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, who was not present at the talks, said on a social media group with reporters that “the negotiations were not easy.” He noted that while the two sides had essentially reached an agreement on technical issues, such as how to monitor a cease-fire, they remained far apart on political issues, including the fate of Ukrainian-held territory in the east of the country that Russia wants as a price for ending the war. Vladimir Medinsky, a Kremlin aide who led the Russian negotiating team in Geneva also acknowledged the challenges, telling Russian media that the talks “were tough but businesslike.” The statements marked a clear contrast with two earlier rounds of trilateral talks between Russia, Ukraine and the United States in Abu Dhabi this month, which negotiators had hailed as constructive and productive . Those discussions appeared to focus on technical matters such as mechanisms for monitoring the cease-fire and prisoner-of-war exchanges, which analysts say are easier to agree on. By contrast, this week’s talks were expected to center on territorial issues that have proved one of the main obstacles to a peace deal so far. Ukrainian officials had also voiced concern about the return of Mr. Medinsky, known for his hard-line stance, to lead the Russian negotiating team in Geneva after he was absent in Abu Dhabi. Kyiv interpreted the move as a sign that Moscow was not ready to compromise. “We can state that Russia is trying to drag out negotiations that could already have reached the final stage,” Mr. Zelensky said on Monday after the first day of talks. Mr. Zelensky has signaled openness to compromising on the territorial issue, suggesting a demilitarized zone in the eastern Donetsk region that Moscow wants, where both Ukrainian and Russian troops would pull back from an equal portion of territory. But he has also made clear that any territorial compromise would come only after Ukraine secures firm security guarantees from its Western allies, above all the United States. That is why the question of territory and security guarantees are tightly interconnected, analysts say. Whichever is resolved first could determine which of the warring sides gains the upper hand in the negotiations, they add. “The sequencing matters a lot,” said Harry Nedelcu, a senior director at Rasmussen Global, a research organization. “The U.S. wants Ukraine to make territorial concessions first, and only then would Washington give Kyiv security guarantees,” Mr. Nedelcu said. “This risks to put Kyiv in a trap. Russia would use the pause to launch another attack.” That concern is particularly acute for the portion of Donetsk still under Ukrainian control. The area is heavily fortified, so surrendering it, or even withdrawing from it as part of a demilitarized zone, could give Russia a strategic foothold to resume attacks. “But if you have security guarantees first,” Mr. Nedelcu added, “it gives Ukrainians bargaining power at the negotiating table and assures Kyiv of international protection to deter another invasion.” In that case, Kyiv could negotiate from a position of confidence, knowing its postwar security would be protected. Strong guarantees might even persuade Ukrainians to accept territorial concessions, an idea that is beginning to gain traction among the local public. Mr. Zelensky has said the United States and Ukraine have agreed on postwar security guarantees, though details have not been disclosed. European diplomats in Kyiv remain skeptical that the guarantees are fully locked in. That has raised concerns that the talks in Switzerland, by focusing on territory while security commitments are not yet in place, may be premature. Mr. Zelensky hinted at this concern in a social media post this week. “Our American friends, they are preparing security guarantees. But they said — first this swap of territories, or something like that, and then security guarantees,” he wrote on X . “I think — first, security guarantees. Second, we will not give up our territories because we are ready for compromise. What kind of compromise are we ready for? Not for the compromise that gives Russia the opportunity to recover quickly and come again and occupy us.” Nataliya Vasilyeva contributed reporting.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT A few days before the Italian skiing legend Alberto Tomba ignited the Olympic cauldron to start the 2026 Winter Games, he greeted his pet rooster near his home in the hills outside Bologna and opened a door beside a sign reading “My Happy Place.” “Here, I have 2,500 bottles,” Mr. Tomba, 59, said as he entered part of a stone farmhouse he had converted into a wine cellar. Dressed in black, with gelled curly hair and oversize sunglasses, the winner of three Olympic gold medals walked under a portrait of himself in his prime and reached for a giant bottle of sparkling wine from 1996. It featured a caricature of himself racing in a fluorescent ski suit. Known back then as “Tomba la Bomba” for his blazing speed, outsize personality and more outsize appetites, Mr. Tomba has since developed a taste for fine wine. He has visited “more cellars than slopes,” he said, and read so deeply about wine that, by his own telling, he was named an “an honorary sommelier” by the Italian Sommelier Association (which did not return requests for confirmation). Over the years, many of the labels on his dust-caked bottles have peeled off. He spilled wine that had been sitting in a cloudy glass onto the gravel floor (“The smell is good for ambience,” he said) and refilled it from a label-less bottle. “I opened it 10 days ago,” he said, swirling the glass. “It’s a ’98.” Image “Here, I have 2,500 bottles,” Mr. Tomba, 59, said of his wine cellar. Credit... Nadia Shira Cohen for The New York Times That vintage happened to be the year Mr. Tomba ended a skiing career that had made him a national icon. He was so famous that broadcasters once broke away from Italy’s national song competition to let viewers watch him ski. He had so much swagger that he once shouted, “I am the new messiah of skiing!” and ate a piece of Christmas cake between runs. (“I had a small slice,” he recalled with a shrug.) He traveled with munitions of Parmesan cheese and signed women’s ski pants while women wore them. He dated Miss Italy, drove a red Ferrari and became, for a time, the most flamboyant expression of Italy’s late ’80s id. Nearly 40 years after Mr. Tomba first burst onto the slopes, the return of the Winter Games to Italy this month has brought him back into heavy circulation. Italian media scrums are once again forming around him as he makes headlines. His face graces the covers of this month’s GQ Italia and the local magazine in Cortina d’Ampezzo, a town hosting some of the Games. He has a book out (“ The Longest Slalom ”) and is the face of streaming services and luxury brands, one of which brought Mr. Tomba to a Cortina boutique this week where fans mobbed him as he signed hundreds of posters. He drew hearts, blew kisses, accepted blown kisses and tested a super fan who told Mr. Tomba to “ask me anything” about the minutiae of his skiing career. Image Mr. Tomba with fans at an event in Cortina d’Ampezzo last week. Credit... James Hill for The New York Times While Mr. Tomba certainly appears to be enjoying the Olympic limelight, his long après-ski has not been entirely victorious. In 2000, he made his acting debut in a poorly reviewed crime series, playing a cop tasked with protecting a beautiful witness. Mr. Tomba said the “action scenes came natural to me,” but he wished he had started slower “as a supporting actor, an extra.” He got into flipping houses , but turned down offers to coach and commentate, he said. Mr. Tomba’s father, a wealthy textile merchant, “banned me,” Mr. Tomba said, from taking skiing-related jobs that would diminish his Olympic aura. For all the medals that had been draped around his neck, Mr. Tomba seemed to carry a chip on his shoulder, harboring old grievances, blaming two-faced friends, the Italian media and nebulous forces for things perhaps not panning out as expected since his retirement. “In Italy, everything is forgiven except success,” he said during an interview a few days before the Games began early this month. Image Mr. Tomba at his countryside home. “In Italy, everything is forgiven except success,” he said. Credit... Nadia Shira Cohen for The New York Times The truth, he said as he ordered the house red in a favorite trattoria near his home, is that he is a simple, misunderstood guy. He likes feeding his rooster Porto and mourns the death of his other rooster, Gallo, eaten by a fox. He wears a Tomba Fan Club bracelet and, he said, enjoys the company of his devoted fans, some of whom used to follow him to finish lines around the world. He is at peace walking around hilltop vineyards, he said, and listening to music on his phone’s speakers, including a theme tune from “Miami Vice.” He usually stays up until 2 a.m. channel-surfing and avoided skiing because, he said, crowds pursue him on the slopes. “I go fast, and they follow me,” he said. He ordered a bowl of lettuce and grilled chicken, noting that he had to slim down in preparation for lighting the Olympic cauldron in Milan. To keep in shape, he said, he sometimes runs the roughly four miles from the cellar to his house, where he lives close to his brother and mother, Maria Grazia Dalla Mora. Mr. Tomba used to call her from pay phones after victories and these days, he said, he wakes up early to check on her before going back to sleep. “You look good,” Ms. Dalla Mora, an elegant 83-year-old, said as she arrived at the trattoria. “Something is different.” “I shaved,” he said. Image Mr. Tomba waved to the crowd last week at the Tofane Alpine Skiing Center in Cortina d’Ampezzo for a women’s downhill race. Credit... James Hill for The New York Times His mother told stories about his youth — the way he and his brother performed ski jumps over peacocks, his “notable absences” from school and the way her late husband sacrificed all his free time to drive Albi, as she, like his friends, called her son, around the country. The food arrived and Mr. Tomba started picking from his companions’ plates. He washed mouthfuls down with wine, and then glasses of water, and then water mixed with wine that he threw back like shots. He greeted a woman he hadn’t seen for decades — “You look great,” he said, taking off his sunglasses — but later argued that “Tomba la Bomba, sex bomb” was a media creation that he had to play along with. His famous televised flirtation in 1992 with Katarina Witt, the German figure skater, “was all set up” by an American television producer. Mr. Tomba said he was not the party animal who, as he once had read, stayed up all night before a race in the company of six women. “Come on, six women?” he said, his mouth full of a spinach omelet that his mother had ordered but didn’t finish. He was always joking, he said — that was what no one understood. “Nothing bad about that,” his mother said with a shrug, adding that her son’s lightheartedness was necessary to combat the “violent stress” and loneliness of the downhill racer. She did wish he had settled down, she said, but family life was “not for him.” Image Loris Righi, the longtime leader of the Alberto Tomba fan club, in a converted garage as videos of the Olympic skier in his prime play in the background. Credit... Nadia Shira Cohen for The New York Times Maybe it wasn’t too late, Mr. Tomba said, emptying a nearby plate of tagliolini onto his own. “A child now?” his mother said. “It was in ’98 that you should have had one.” “If I’m a bachelor it’s her fault,” he said, ordering dessert. “Because no one was ever good enough for her.” She rolled her eyes as his laments mounted. “Calm down already,” she said. He chuckled and shrugged and drenched scoops of vanilla ice cream with Grand Marnier and finished his mother’s crema Catalana. “After this don’t eat any more today,” she said. “Or tomorrow.” Throughout the lunch and his visit to the cellar, Mr. Tomba insisted that his fan club’s headquarters, run by Loris Righi, best captured who he was and required a visit. “Welcome to Tombaland. Here, the party continues,” Mr.",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Jesse Jackson lobbied Pope John Paul II and the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to rebuke South Africa’s apartheid government. He called on Harvard University to divest from the country. And he was there when Nelson Mandela was released from Robben Island in 1990 after serving 27 years as a political prisoner. Just as Mr. Jackson, who died on Tuesday, became synonymous with the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, he was esteemed across Africa, particularly for his vigorous activism against the apartheid regime in South Africa. Mr. Jackson first visited South Africa in 1979, two years after the killing of the anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko . He drew massive crowds at rallies in Soweto, a deeply impoverished township where the white-minority government forced Black people to live. In the decades that followed, he made several trips back to other countries in Africa as a peace broker and a representative of Black America who showed that the U.S. government’s acceptance of apartheid did not align with the views of many of its citizens. “We are deeply indebted to the energy, principled clarity and personal risk with which he supported our struggle and campaigned for freedom and equality in other parts of the world,” President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa said in a statement on Tuesday. Mr. Jackson’s devotion to the anti-apartheid struggle stemmed from the parallels he saw with the fight for civil rights in the United States. “As a young civil rights activist, I knew how raw and ugly and violent the apartheid regime was,” he wrote in an opinion column in the Guardian in 2013. “They were being jailed, we were being jailed. We were being killed, and they were being massacred.” In 1986, Mr. Jackson took a whirlwind, eight-country tour of Africa, where he was greeted by huge crowds, red carpets, state dinners and lengthy meetings with heads of state. In Zambia, he delivered a speech that moved Kenneth Kaunda, the country’s president at the time, to tears. He sought to make Americans aware of the ripple effects that apartheid was having in the region and vowed to push President Ronald Reagan to support the nations surrounding South Africa. Mr. Jackson would return to Africa in the late 1990s as an envoy for President Bill Clinton, working to intervene in conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, Zambia and Nigeria. On Tuesday, President Bola Tinubu of Nigeria recognized his work in a statement: “Reverend Jackson was a great friend of Nigeria and Africa.” John Eligon is the Johannesburg bureau chief for The Times, covering a wide range of events and trends that influence and shape the lives of ordinary people across southern Africa.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Peru’s Congress voted on Tuesday to impeach President José Jerí after he failed to disclose meetings with Chinese businessmen who were under government scrutiny, the latest upheaval in a country that has cycled through leaders with striking speed. Mr. Jerí, 39, the former head of Congress, took office as interim president in October after presiding over the removal of his predecessor. He is the sixth Peruvian president in the past decade to leave office before their term ended. One stepped down within days of taking office. The Congress passed seven motions of impeachment, 75 in favor, 24 against and 3 abstentions. The legislature will vote to choose a new leader on Wednesday, leaving the presidency vacant for the moment, experts said. Peru is scheduled to hold a general election on April 12, and will transfer power to a new president on July 28. Mr. Jerí is not a candidate, and presidents in Peru cannot run for consecutive re-election. The impeachment followed the release last month of three videos showing Mr. Jerí entering a restaurant and convenience store in Lima owned by Yang Zhihua, a wealthy Chinese businessman who has come under government scrutiny. Local outlets reported that one of Mr. Yang’s stores had been ordered closed for violating a municipal ordinance; three days later a national regulatory body overturned the law that led to the closure. Mr. Jerí acknowledged that the videos were authentic. Peruvian law requires presidents to log their official activities, and he did not report the visits to Mr. Yang’s establishments, Mr. Jerí admitted under questioning from lawmakers last month. During that questioning he declined to provide his phone records and said he had known Mr. Yang before becoming president. He added that the businessman had refused to let him pay for some candy and paintings he bought “because he was being kind to me.” The explanations failed to quell criticism. Lawmakers across the political spectrum called for his removal and the attorney general opened a corruption inquiry into Mr. Jerí’s interactions with Mr. Yang. Mr. Jerí has accused rivals of leaking the footage to influence the upcoming elections. Since the scandal erupted, Mr. Jerí’s approval ratings have dropped by 10 percentage points from his 51 percent rating, polls show . The controversy widened when Cuarto Poder, a television program that first broadcast the videos, reported that another Chinese businessman, Ji Wu Xiaodong — who is under house arrest while being investigated for alleged ties to an illegal logging network — had visited the presidential palace three times during Mr. Jerí’s tenure. The president told lawmakers that Mr. Ji Wu was a friend of Mr. Yang’s and said he did not know him well. The episode underscores Peru’s entrenched political instability epitomized by what has been the revolving door of the country’s presidency. Since 2016, a succession of presidents has been impeached, forced to resign or investigated. The upheaval comes after the removal four months ago of Dina Boluarte, one of the most unpopular presidents in recent decades, amid public anger over surging crime. Ms. Boluarte herself had ascended to the presidency in 2022 after her predecessor, Pedro Castillo — for whom she had served as vice president — tried to dissolve Congress and overhaul the judiciary. He was swiftly impeached and arrested, and last year he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for conspiracy and rebellion. That episode was only one in a long chain. Nearly every living former president has faced a criminal investigation. Alejandro Toledo, who served as president of Peru from 2001 to 2006, was sentenced to 20 years for accepting bribes, and Ollanta Humala, president from 2011 to 2016, was convicted of laundering campaign funds tied to Odebrecht, a Brazilian firm. Alberto Fujimori, Peru’s authoritarian leader of the 1990s, served more than a decade in prison for human rights abuses and corruption before a controversial pardon in 2023. He died in 2024 at 86.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Uber said on Wednesday that it would offer incentives to other companies to install electric vehicle chargers in the United States and Europe, a potential boost for a part of the car market that has been hurt by recent U.S. policy changes. The company said it would guarantee that chargers installed in neighborhoods where its drivers lived or often picked up or dropped off passengers would be used a minimum amount of time. The offer should allow charging operators to more quickly recoup their investment in new stations. How much chargers are used is a key to whether they make or lose money but difficult to predict. Sales of electric vehicles have slumped in the United States after Republicans in Congress and President Trump revoked various policies intended to encourage sales of cars with no tailpipe emissions. But construction of charging stations grew at a record pace last year despite the policy shift, in part because of Uber drivers like Charles Iwuoha, one of 13,000 ride-share drivers who use electric vehicles in New York City. He bought a Kia EV9, an electric sport utility vehicle, last year with financial help from Uber. The car’s battery lasts a full 10-hour shift, he said. And it costs him $20 to $40 less to charge the car than refueling the gasoline vehicle he previously owned. That is a significant savings, said Mr. Iwuoha, who lives in Queens. “New York rent is too high,” he said. Driving an Uber “pays the bills, but you’re just scraping by.” Ride-share drivers are among the heaviest users of public chargers, especially the kinds of devices that can top up a battery in half an hour or less, according to analysts and charging companies. The money that drivers for Uber, Lyft and other ride-hailing services pay to charge cars is a big reason for the growth in the number of charging stations. But chargers are not always built where Uber drivers need them. Mr. Iwuoha, for example, lives in an apartment building and cannot charge at home. He is dependent on fast public chargers, which are often crowded, especially in Manhattan. Pradeep Parameswaran, Uber’s global head of mobility, said his company hoped to alleviate some of those problems by getting 1,000 chargers built. “Over time, we think electrification helps bring down the cost of running their business on Uber,” he said in an interview. “And ultimately, it’s good for cities. It brings down emissions.” Jeroen van Tilburg, the chief executive of Ionity, a European charging company that is working with Uber, said Uber’s data would help it identify the best places to build chargers. “The biggest concern for every charge point operator is to identify the right location,” Mr. van Tilburg said. The stations built with Uber’s support will be open to anyone and could be particularly useful to renters and other urban residents who cannot charge at home. Uber said it was hoping to encourage new stations in New York, Los Angeles, Boston, San Francisco, London, Paris and Madrid. Uber also said on Wednesday that it would spend $100 million to build charging hubs for autonomous vehicles, which are almost always electric. Uber, whose business is potentially threatened by self-driving taxis, has been trying to position itself as a partner to companies like Waymo, a unit of Alphabet, Google’s parent company. In Austin, Texas, for example, Uber provides charging, cleaning and maintenance for Waymo’s taxis. Despite headwinds from Washington, the number of chargers in the United States increased 30 percent last year to 70,000 ports, according to Paren, a research firm that specializes in electric vehicle charging. That included a 44 percent increase in the last three months of the year, when electric vehicle sales plummeted after a tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of such models ended. Early figures for 2026 showed that growth remains strong, said Florent Breton, the chief executive of Paren. That is despite obstacles thrown up by the Trump administration. Last week, Sean Duffy, the secretary of transportation, proposed a rule that would require that chargers contain no parts manufactured outside the United States in order to receive federal funding under a program passed during the Biden administration. Electric vehicle experts say that’s an impossible standard to meet. But the practical effect of that proposal is limited because the large majority of chargers being installed in the United States receive no federal funding. Ride-share drivers are a big reason that demand for charging remains strong. Their cars account for about one quarter of the energy dispensed by EVgo, the third-largest U.S. operator of charging stations and an Uber partner. That compares with about 10 percent in 2021. “Electrification of ride share is something that we’ve been seeing quarter after quarter, year after year, for several years now,” Badar Khan, the chief executive of EVgo, said in an interview. “Anything that we can do in our partnership with Uber to increase the rollout of infrastructure will just accelerate the adoption of electrical vehicles.” Charging has become one of the main obstacles to buying an electric vehicle, according to drivers surveyed by Uber. Used electric vehicles sell for less than comparable gasoline models and are generally cheaper to fuel and maintain, according to calculations by the company. New electric vehicles cost more, but the gap is narrowing. Uber also offers drivers a $4,000 grant they can use to buy electric vehicles. (Drivers must log at least 100 trips to qualify.) Mr. Iwuoha, the Uber driver, said he had chosen an electric car in part because he was concerned about the environment, and in anticipation of New York regulations that will require all ride-share vehicles to be zero emission or handicapped accessible by 2030. He bought his Kia new before the $7,500 federal tax credit expired. If it were up to him, chargers would be available in the parking lots of public parks and at many more gas stations. “Time is money,” Mr. Iwuoha said.

Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 8:42 min Learn more Share full article By Carlotta Gall and Hussam Hammoud Photographs by Nanna Heitmann A team of New York Times reporters and a photographer spent two weeks in northeastern Syria and visited three detention facilities. Feb. 18, 2026 Orange jump suits lay strewed on the ground, dropped in a trail as the prisoners made their escape, the only sign left of the former inmates. The guards’ quarters were abandoned and the prison gates swung in the wind. The prison break in January just outside the town of Shadaddi in northeastern Syria was a stark example of the sudden change of power that has upended a system of two dozen high-security prisons holding thousands of members of the terrorist group the Islamic State. In recent weeks, Syrian government forces seized control of a wide swath of territory in northeastern Syria from the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., a Kurdish-led force that had worked for years with a U.S.-led coalition to combat the Islamic State and to guard camps and prisons. The change has now made the problem of the prisoners one for President Ahmed al-Sharaa, testing his commitment to fighting extremism. It has also forced a rapid recalculation by the U.S.-led coalition and many other states of what to do with the thousands of detainees and families held in prisons and camps since the defeat of the Islamic State in 2019. Shortly after the breakout at Shadaddi prison on Jan. 19, the U.S. military began a complex operation to transfer thousands of adult male detainees to detention facilities in Iraq, starting with those considered the most dangerous. The Syrian government took control of several prisons and detention camps, including Shadaddi prison and a sprawling camp known as Al Hol, which housed more than 20,000 women and children, some displaced by the war but many of them families of fighters from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. A team from The New York Times visited both facilities earlier this month. Shadaddi was deserted. In Al Hol, entire sections of the camp appeared uninhabited, with tents in shreds and a school building in one section abandoned. The Syrian government has made it clear that it would not continue to run the prison system the way it had been. After it took over Al Hol, it allowed thousands to leave and announced on Tuesday that it had evacuated or relocated the last families from the camp. “Al Hol includes many families who are not ISIS,” including women and children displaced by the war, Badri al-Masloukh, the deputy governor of nearby Deir al Zour Province, said in an interview. “Keeping them there is not a solution.” But the government also blamed the S.D.F. for withdrawing from Al Hol without coordinating a handover of the camp. Government forces arrived 10 hours after the S.D.F. had left, which it said created a security vacuum that allowed hundreds of families to escape. Image Women and children at Al Hol this month. In the chaos, the Islamic State was primed and ready to break out some of its members, according to Bashar Hassan, an independent researcher in Syria who follows the group. The Islamic State had sleeper cells in Syria, but operatives also arrived from Iraq around Jan. 19, apparently to take advantage of the disarray, he said. “That mess was useful to them,” he said. “The first thing they focused on was seizing weapons.” A map of Syria highlighting Shadaddi.

SYRIA LEBANON IRAQ Damascus JORDAN 100 Miles Mr. Hassan saw a lot of chatter on ISIS communication channels and media statements, he said, confirmed by his own sources close to the movement. Those who escaped included a woman, known as Um Fahad, who was considered the leader of ISIS families in the camp. Mr. Hassan showed a reporter posts about Um Fahad’s escape on a private ISIS chat group. “There was a lot of congratulating each other,” he said. There were also Lebanese families who were known to have been in Al Hol and who were celebrating their return recently on a social media group, he said. Those early breakouts from Al Hol were aimed at freeing specific families, which indicated a level of planning by ISIS, as did the swift travel of families across the border into Lebanon, Mr. Hassan said. “How did they reach Lebanon?” he said. “It is more than 800 kilometers, so it indicates that something organized happened. It was not just accidental.” Image An Iraqi family in Al Hol Camp this month. Many Iraqis have been repatriated, but some of those in the camp said they feared going home and were hoping to be resettled in Syria. Aid organizations that worked at Al Hol warned that the sudden mass departure raised a host of security questions, not just about those who had escaped but also about whether some in the Syrian security forces helped open the gates for the detainees. President al-Sharaa, who led a group affiliated with Al Qaeda in Syria during the civil war, has been accused of harboring extremists and Islamists who sympathize with ISIS in his own ranks. Government officials have denied that, saying that the government has come under attack from ISIS members and that it is sincere in its opposition to the group. A vast camp, Al Hol is divided into sections, with the annex housing 6,000 women and children who were neither from Syria nor Iraq. The majority were Chinese, Russians and Turks. Aid workers visiting the camp in recent days said the annex had been emptied out. The government said it was monitoring the families of ISIS fighters with foreign nationalities who had left the camp to head off any potential security threats. There was a steady flow of Syrian and Iraqi families leaving the camp, helped by a convoy of vans, pickups and buses up until last weekend. A post on an Al Hol chat group on Telegram on Sunday described families camped on the roads begging rides and friends and volunteers helping them return to their families. Image Entire sections of the Al Hol camp appeared abandoned this month. It once held more than 20,000 women and children, some displaced by the war but many of them families of ISIS members. One guard said the government had organized what he described as large-scale evacuations of inmates in recent days. According to him, about 5,000 women and children were evacuated in buses from Feb. 7 to Feb. 9 to camps in Idlib Province in northwestern Syria. Others thought to have links to ISIS were being transported to another camp in Aleppo Province, he said. Syrian inmates, who include people displaced by the war, were being released if a relative came to vouch for them, he said. One relative was allowed inside to help them pack up their belongings and dismantle their tent, he said. The guard denied that there was much smuggling of inmates, saying that two smugglers who had tried to take out people had been arrested. The guard spoke on the condition that his name not be published because he was not allowed to talk to the media. Image A member of Syrian General Security forces patrols inside Al Hol camp. At Shadaddi prison, there were some signs that the breakout had occurred with outside help. The outer camp occupied by guards showed no sign of fighting or violence, but bullet holes on two sets of inner metal gates indicated that people had shot out the locks from the outside. The Syrian government played down the importance of the breakout, saying it had recaptured all but 20 of the escapees.

Halbfinger reported from Jerusalem, and Bilal Shbair from Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip. Feb. 18, 2026 In the midst of a crowded camp for displaced Palestinians in southern Gaza, a gate with a jarringly upbeat poster of a bright red cartoon racing car sticks out. Inside, a passageway to a compound of tent classrooms is adorned with children’s drawings more reflective of real life. One shows an orange and yellow home, green grass and olive trees over the handwritten words “I had a house, but today I have nothing.” Raseel al-Shaer, 12, pauses to tell a visitor how good it feels to be learning alongside other children again in al-Mawasi. “Here, it is safe,” she says. “No drones or bombs. The best thing is sitting at a desk and seeing the teacher and the board, and holding a pencil again.” Quietly, and despite considerable risk, a network of free private schools for war orphans and other children has sprouted in the Gaza Strip. The schools, called Academies of Hope, are the brainchild of a Palestinian American neurosurgeon, Dr. David Hasan, who first visited Gaza on medical relief missions soon after Israel invaded Gaza in the wake of the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023. Image “No drones or bombs,” one student said. “The best thing is sitting at a desk and seeing the teacher and the board, and holding a pencil again.” Image Some 9,000 pupils in grades one through nine attend classes in five areas across southern Gaza. Though he hasn’t been back to Gaza since early 2024, he has built the institutions by forging partnerships with humanitarian groups on the ground, hiring Palestinian staff over WhatsApp and raising money — largely from Jewish donors — in the United States and Israel. Some 9,000 pupils in grades one through nine are attending classes in five campuses in southern Gaza. They cycle through the schools in three-hour shifts and receive hot meals and medical and psychological care. Operating schools in any war zone is hard enough, and schools across the enclave are struggling to rebuild. But Dr. Hasan has compounded his challenges. He revamped a much-criticized national curriculum and worked to keep Hamas from endangering his schools. He also verifies that none of his staff have ties to militant groups, a charge Israel has leveled against the United Nations agency caring for Palestinians in Gaza and some international aid groups. The schools teach a modified version of the Palestinian Authority’s curriculum, which is taught in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza, but without any lessons demonizing Jews or glorifying perpetrators of violence against Israel. Dr. Hasan said the curriculum changes were made without the authority’s permission, prompting threats of reprisal from its education ministry. A ministry spokesman did not respond to repeated messages seeking comment. Image Most children in Gaza have been out of school for more than two years. Image Some of the drawings made by the children, with a picture of Dr. David Hasan in the middle. Israel, the United States and the European Union have long complained that the authority’s textbooks inculcate hatred and antisemitism. The authority says that its schools appropriately teach Palestinian nationalism, history and culture. Before-and-after excerpts from the curriculum illustrate the changes: A math problem comparing the number of “martyrs” killed in the first and second intifadas has been replaced with one involving attendance at a West Bank soccer match. A reading comprehension selection praising Dalal Mughrabi — a woman who led a 1978 massacre that killed 38 Israelis, 13 of them children — has been replaced with one about Hind al-Husseini, a pioneering Palestinian educator. And in an Islamic studies class, a reading about an attempt by Jews to kill the Prophet Muhammad has been replaced with one about the prophet’s expressions of respect for Jews. Dr. Hasan’s team also added new weekly lessons on “peace building” that teach ideals like tolerance and respect for differences, the golden rule and conflict resolution. In a video recorded by a school employee during one lesson recently, a boy draws pictures of the Palestinian and Israeli flags side by side. “I wish there will be no more wars so that we can live,” he says. Video The children cycle through the schools in three-hour shifts and receive hot meals and medical and psychological care. Image Dr. Hasan, in red cap, operating during his time volunteering in Gaza. Credit... via Dr. David Hasan Dr. Hasan acknowledged that his peace-building curriculum was politically fraught and that some of his teachers were fearful of blowback from Hamas as it re-establishes its control over much of Gaza. Some faculty members have quit or been fired over such concerns, he said. He said he was even exploring installing cameras in classrooms to ensure that the curriculum changes are upheld. On social media, some Gazans have asked whether Dr. Hasan’s agenda is overly aligned with Israel’s. Others, embittered by Hamas, have retorted that it’s better to teach tolerance than to teach children to sacrifice themselves. Discomfort with the subject was clear in interviews with faculty members, most of whom had not been hired from other schools — they were either teaching for the first time or were retired principals. They emphasized that they were using the standard Palestinian curriculum, though when pressed, acknowledged some deletions. Alaa Sabbah, 35, who was guiding a class through the basic components of a cell, said he wasn’t teaching only science. “We teach respect, tolerance and accepting others,” he said. “We teach them how to rise again, like a phoenix, and how to come back to life from under the rubble. We teach them to love people and to socialize.” When the first school opened last July, Dr. Hasan said he gave the Israeli military the school’s coordinates, hoping to protect it. In August, the staff received a warning of an Israeli attack and evacuated. An airstrike soon after hit militants next door. The school suffered little damage but soon found a new site, Dr. Hasan said. That first school had space for 200 students, he said. On the first day, 500 showed up. “Some hadn’t had food for days,” he said. “The kids were so excited — for the first time they were thriving,” he added. “And they didn’t want to go home. We had to kick them out in the evening.” Image Students receiving a meal before they head home at the end of their school day. Image A nurse examining a student. Last summer, as malnutrition was taking hold under an Israeli blockade, Dr. Hasan said, he bought tons of flour on the black market for people living in Deir al-Balah. Having earned the gratitude of local elders, he said, he persuaded them to give him space for a school. Since then, he said, leaders of big families in Gaza have helped him obtain space for more schools. “The way we did it is by gaining trust,” he said. One way is by ensuring those families — as well as the Israelis and his donors — that his staff has no ties to militant groups. Dr. Hasan said that every employee had been cleared with the Israeli authorities and checked against a U.S. government sanctions list. He also makes clear that his donors include Israelis. “I told the elders, ‘I work with the Israelis,’” he said. “They said, ‘As long as they don’t want to brainwash our kids, we’re fine.’” A researcher and professor at Duke University’s medical school, Dr. Hasan, 53, had no background in humanitarian aid before the 2023 attack. Nor was he particularly connected to Palestinian life. Born in Kuwait to Palestinians from the West Bank, he left the Middle East at 18 to attend college in Texas. At 19, he dropped h",

Feb. 18, 2026 Highway 1 was once among the most dangerous, damaged arteries in Afghanistan. But on a recent 300-mile road trip between Afghanistan’s two largest cities, Times journalists only encountered order and security — and not a single pothole. Since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021, they have worked to replace the violence that largely defined this highway, and the country, with strengthened security and administration. Once littered with bomb craters and trenches dug by overweight trucks, the road is now smooth enough for travelers to nap while riding through the barren plains of Afghanistan’s east.

This is the Afghanistan that the Taliban government has rebuilt over the past four and a half years, after the United States withdrawal. It is what the Taliban want the world to see as they try to attract foreign investment and recognition. There is order, security and signs of an economic rebound, they say. The Afghan economy grew by 4.3 percent last year, according to the World Bank, up from 2.5 percent in 2024. Video Order, security and signs of economic activity: This is the Afghanistan that the Taliban government wants the world to see as it tries to attract foreign investment and recognition. “All the heavy weapons and the money of the previous government didn’t accomplish much,” said Iqbal Noori, the owner of a mobile phone shop in Kandahar, Afghanistan’s second-largest city. “We have to trust the Taliban. We don’t have another option.” Highway 1 was once the showpiece of the U.S. reconstruction effort in Afghanistan. But it also became a symbol of squandered billions in Western aid. In 2016, an audit by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction found that 95 percent of the paved roads had been damaged or destroyed. Amid frequent fighting, the 300-mile trip between Kabul and Kandahar could stretch to 18 hours. Travelers can now complete the journey in eight.

The Taliban are now renovating what they once sought to dismantle during their insurgency. They are expanding Highway 1 with two extra lanes and strictly enforcing weight limits on trucks to preserve the new asphalt. They are erecting a mosque every 40 miles and urging real estate developers to build around them. In the evening, we stopped at a roadside stall where Nasibullah Khaksar sold almonds and dried apricots. Growing up next to Highway 1 meant a life of constant interruption, where playing outside or going to school was often impossible. “The sight of a Taliban patrol was a sign that fighting would start soon,” he said. Now, Mr. Khaksar said, he can ride his motorcycle at night without fear, and he never locks his shop. The fields nearby are just fields, not battlefields. Image Flashy gas stations are a common sight among Highway 1. As the Taliban are erecting a mosque every 40 miles, they are also urging real estate developers to build gas stations, restaurants and hotels around them. But the flawless asphalt can be a thin veneer. From the hills, the road looks like a lonely snake cutting through a parched landscape. Farmers say their fields have grown barren because of drought and contaminated groundwater. Women and girls were all but invisible on the journey save for a few glimpsed in the back of passing taxis and buses. The Taliban have effectively erased them from public life, banning them from most jobs and school beyond sixth grade, and forbidding them to travel long distances without a male companion.

The war took his mother and two siblings, Mr. Himayat said, but at least he was fighting for a cause — the establishment of Taliban rule.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Ukrainian and Russian officials wrapped up a new round of U.S.-mediated peace talks on Wednesday after a second day of discussions that lasted just two hours, a brief session that suggested little progress was achieved and underscored that a deal remains elusive as fighting rages on the battlefield. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, who was not present at the talks, said on a social media group with reporters that “the negotiations were not easy.” He noted that while the two sides had essentially reached an agreement on technical issues, such as how to monitor a cease-fire, they remained far apart on political issues, including the fate of Ukrainian-held territory in the east of the country that Russia wants as a price for ending the war. Vladimir Medinsky, a Kremlin aide who led the Russian negotiating team in Geneva also acknowledged the challenges, telling Russian media that the talks “were tough but businesslike.” The statements marked a clear contrast with two earlier rounds of trilateral talks between Russia, Ukraine and the United States in Abu Dhabi this month, which negotiators had hailed as constructive and productive . Those discussions appeared to focus on technical matters such as mechanisms for monitoring the cease-fire and prisoner-of-war exchanges, which analysts say are easier to agree on. By contrast, this week’s talks were expected to center on territorial issues that have proved one of the main obstacles to a peace deal so far. Ukrainian officials had also voiced concern about the return of Mr. Medinsky, known for his hard-line stance, to lead the Russian negotiating team in Geneva after he was absent in Abu Dhabi. Kyiv interpreted the move as a sign that Moscow was not ready to compromise. “We can state that Russia is trying to drag out negotiations that could already have reached the final stage,” Mr. Zelensky said on Monday after the first day of talks. Mr. Zelensky has signaled openness to compromising on the territorial issue, suggesting a demilitarized zone in the eastern Donetsk region that Moscow wants, where both Ukrainian and Russian troops would pull back from an equal portion of territory. But he has also made clear that any territorial compromise would come only after Ukraine secures firm security guarantees from its Western allies, above all the United States. That is why the question of territory and security guarantees are tightly interconnected, analysts say. Whichever is resolved first could determine which of the warring sides gains the upper hand in the negotiations, they add. “The sequencing matters a lot,” said Harry Nedelcu, a senior director at Rasmussen Global, a research organization. “The U.S. wants Ukraine to make territorial concessions first, and only then would Washington give Kyiv security guarantees,” Mr. Nedelcu said. “This risks to put Kyiv in a trap. Russia would use the pause to launch another attack.” That concern is particularly acute for the portion of Donetsk still under Ukrainian control. The area is heavily fortified, so surrendering it, or even withdrawing from it as part of a demilitarized zone, could give Russia a strategic foothold to resume attacks. “But if you have security guarantees first,” Mr. Nedelcu added, “it gives Ukrainians bargaining power at the negotiating table and assures Kyiv of international protection to deter another invasion.” In that case, Kyiv could negotiate from a position of confidence, knowing its postwar security would be protected. Strong guarantees might even persuade Ukrainians to accept territorial concessions, an idea that is beginning to gain traction among the local public. Mr. Zelensky has said the United States and Ukraine have agreed on postwar security guarantees, though details have not been disclosed. European diplomats in Kyiv remain skeptical that the guarantees are fully locked in. That has raised concerns that the talks in Switzerland, by focusing on territory while security commitments are not yet in place, may be premature. Mr. Zelensky hinted at this concern in a social media post this week. “Our American friends, they are preparing security guarantees. But they said — first this swap of territories, or something like that, and then security guarantees,” he wrote on X . “I think — first, security guarantees. Second, we will not give up our territories because we are ready for compromise. What kind of compromise are we ready for? Not for the compromise that gives Russia the opportunity to recover quickly and come again and occupy us.” Nataliya Vasilyeva contributed reporting.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT A few days before the Italian skiing legend Alberto Tomba ignited the Olympic cauldron to start the 2026 Winter Games, he greeted his pet rooster near his home in the hills outside Bologna and opened a door beside a sign reading “My Happy Place.” “Here, I have 2,500 bottles,” Mr. Tomba, 59, said as he entered part of a stone farmhouse he had converted into a wine cellar. Dressed in black, with gelled curly hair and oversize sunglasses, the winner of three Olympic gold medals walked under a portrait of himself in his prime and reached for a giant bottle of sparkling wine from 1996. It featured a caricature of himself racing in a fluorescent ski suit. Known back then as “Tomba la Bomba” for his blazing speed, outsize personality and more outsize appetites, Mr. Tomba has since developed a taste for fine wine. He has visited “more cellars than slopes,” he said, and read so deeply about wine that, by his own telling, he was named an “an honorary sommelier” by the Italian Sommelier Association (which did not return requests for confirmation). Over the years, many of the labels on his dust-caked bottles have peeled off. He spilled wine that had been sitting in a cloudy glass onto the gravel floor (“The smell is good for ambience,” he said) and refilled it from a label-less bottle. “I opened it 10 days ago,” he said, swirling the glass. “It’s a ’98.” Image “Here, I have 2,500 bottles,” Mr. Tomba, 59, said of his wine cellar. Credit... Nadia Shira Cohen for The New York Times That vintage happened to be the year Mr. Tomba ended a skiing career that had made him a national icon. He was so famous that broadcasters once broke away from Italy’s national song competition to let viewers watch him ski. He had so much swagger that he once shouted, “I am the new messiah of skiing!” and ate a piece of Christmas cake between runs. (“I had a small slice,” he recalled with a shrug.) He traveled with munitions of Parmesan cheese and signed women’s ski pants while women wore them. He dated Miss Italy, drove a red Ferrari and became, for a time, the most flamboyant expression of Italy’s late ’80s id. Nearly 40 years after Mr. Tomba first burst onto the slopes, the return of the Winter Games to Italy this month has brought him back into heavy circulation. Italian media scrums are once again forming around him as he makes headlines. His face graces the covers of this month’s GQ Italia and the local magazine in Cortina d’Ampezzo, a town hosting some of the Games. He has a book out (“ The Longest Slalom ”) and is the face of streaming services and luxury brands, one of which brought Mr. Tomba to a Cortina boutique this week where fans mobbed him as he signed hundreds of posters.

James Hill for The New York Times While Mr. Tomba certainly appears to be enjoying the Olympic limelight, his long après-ski has not been entirely victorious. In 2000, he made his acting debut in a poorly reviewed crime series, playing a cop tasked with protecting a beautiful witness. Mr. Tomba said the “action scenes came natural to me,” but he wished he had started slower “as a supporting actor, an extra.” He got into flipping houses , but turned down offers to coach and commentate, he said. Mr. Tomba’s father, a wealthy textile merchant, “banned me,” Mr. Tomba said, from taking skiing-related jobs that would diminish his Olympic aura. For all the medals that had been draped around his neck, Mr. Tomba seemed to carry a chip on his shoulder, harboring old grievances, blaming two-faced friends, the Italian media and nebulous forces for things perhaps not panning out as expected since his retirement. “In Italy, everything is forgiven except success,” he said during an interview a few days before the Games began early this month.

Nadia Shira Cohen for The New York Times The truth, he said as he ordered the house red in a favorite trattoria near his home, is that he is a simple, misunderstood guy. He likes feeding his rooster Porto and mourns the death of his other rooster, Gallo, eaten by a fox. He wears a Tomba Fan Club bracelet and, he said, enjoys the company of his devoted fans, some of whom used to follow him to finish lines around the world. He is at peace walking around hilltop vineyards, he said, and listening to music on his phone’s speakers, including a theme tune from “Miami Vice.” He usually stays up until 2 a.m. channel-surfing and avoided skiing because, he said, crowds pursue him on the slopes. “I go fast, and they follow me,” he said. He ordered a bowl of lettuce and grilled chicken, noting that he had to slim down in preparation for lighting the Olympic cauldron in Milan. To keep in shape, he said, he sometimes runs the roughly four miles from the cellar to his house, where he lives close to his brother and mother, Maria Grazia Dalla Mora. Mr. Tomba used to call her from pay phones after victories and these days, he said, he wakes up early to check on her before going back to sleep. “You look good,” Ms. Dalla Mora, an elegant 83-year-old, said as she arrived at the trattoria. “Something is different.” “I shaved,” he said. Image Mr. Tomba waved to the crowd last week at the Tofane Alpine Skiing Center in Cortina d’Ampezzo for a women’s downhill race. Credit... James Hill for The New York Times His mother told stories about his youth — the way he and his brother performed ski jumps over peacocks, his “notable absences” from school and the way her late husband sacrificed all his free time to drive Albi, as she, like his friends, called her son, around the country. The food arrived and Mr. Tomba started picking from his companions’ plates. He washed mouthfuls down with wine, and then glasses of water, and then water mixed with wine that he threw back like shots. He greeted a woman he hadn’t seen for decades — “You look great,” he said, taking off his sunglasses — but later argued that “Tomba la Bomba, sex bomb” was a media creation that he had to play along with. His famous televised flirtation in 1992 with Katarina Witt, the German figure skater, “was all set up” by an American television producer. Mr. Tomba said he was not the party animal who, as he once had read, stayed up all night before a race in the company of six women. “Come on, six women?” he said, his mouth full of a spinach omelet that his mother had ordered but didn’t finish. He was always joking, he said — that was what no one understood. “Nothing bad about that,” his mother said with a shrug, adding that her son’s lightheartedness was necessary to combat the “violent stress” and loneliness of the downhill racer. She did wish he had settled down, she said, but family life was “not for him.” Image Loris Righi, the longtime leader of the Alberto Tomba fan club, in a converted garage as videos of the Olympic skier in his prime play in the background. Credit... Nadia Shira Cohen for The New York Times Maybe it wasn’t too late, Mr. Tomba said, emptying a nearby plate of tagliolini onto his own. “A child now?” his mother said. “It was in ’98 that you should have had one.” “If I’m a bachelor it’s her fault,” he said, ordering dessert. “Because no one was ever good enough for her.” She rolled her eyes as his laments mounted. “Calm down already,” she said. He chuckled and shrugged and drenched scoops of vanilla ice cream with Grand Marnier and finished his mother’s crema Catalana. “After this don’t eat any more today,” she said. “Or tomorrow.” Throughout the lunch and his visit to the cellar, Mr. Tomba insisted that his fan club’s headquarters, run by Loris Righi, best captured who he was and required a visit. “Welcome to Tombaland. Here, the party continues,” Mr.",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Jesse Jackson lobbied Pope John Paul II and the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to rebuke South Africa’s apartheid government. He called on Harvard University to divest from the country. And he was there when Nelson Mandela was released from Robben Island in 1990 after serving 27 years as a political prisoner. Just as Mr. Jackson, who died on Tuesday, became synonymous with the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, he was esteemed across Africa, particularly for his vigorous activism against the apartheid regime in South Africa. Mr. Jackson first visited South Africa in 1979, two years after the killing of the anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko . He drew massive crowds at rallies in Soweto, a deeply impoverished township where the white-minority government forced Black people to live. In the decades that followed, he made several trips back to other countries in Africa as a peace broker and a representative of Black America who showed that the U.S. government’s acceptance of apartheid did not align with the views of many of its citizens. “We are deeply indebted to the energy, principled clarity and personal risk with which he supported our struggle and campaigned for freedom and equality in other parts of the world,” President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa said in a statement on Tuesday. Mr. Jackson’s devotion to the anti-apartheid struggle stemmed from the parallels he saw with the fight for civil rights in the United States. “As a young civil rights activist, I knew how raw and ugly and violent the apartheid regime was,” he wrote in an opinion column in the Guardian in 2013. “They were being jailed, we were being jailed. We were being killed, and they were being massacred.” In 1986, Mr. Jackson took a whirlwind, eight-country tour of Africa, where he was greeted by huge crowds, red carpets, state dinners and lengthy meetings with heads of state. In Zambia, he delivered a speech that moved Kenneth Kaunda, the country’s president at the time, to tears. He sought to make Americans aware of the ripple effects that apartheid was having in the region and vowed to push President Ronald Reagan to support the nations surrounding South Africa. Mr. Jackson would return to Africa in the late 1990s as an envoy for President Bill Clinton, working to intervene in conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, Zambia and Nigeria. On Tuesday, President Bola Tinubu of Nigeria recognized his work in a statement: “Reverend Jackson was a great friend of Nigeria and Africa.” John Eligon is the Johannesburg bureau chief for The Times, covering a wide range of events and trends that influence and shape the lives of ordinary people across southern Africa.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Peru’s Congress voted on Tuesday to impeach President José Jerí after he failed to disclose meetings with Chinese businessmen who were under government scrutiny, the latest upheaval in a country that has cycled through leaders with striking speed. Mr. Jerí, 39, the former head of Congress, took office as interim president in October after presiding over the removal of his predecessor. He is the sixth Peruvian president in the past decade to leave office before their term ended. One stepped down within days of taking office. The Congress passed seven motions of impeachment, 75 in favor, 24 against and 3 abstentions. The legislature will vote to choose a new leader on Wednesday, leaving the presidency vacant for the moment, experts said. Peru is scheduled to hold a general election on April 12, and will transfer power to a new president on July 28. Mr. Jerí is not a candidate, and presidents in Peru cannot run for consecutive re-election. The impeachment followed the release last month of three videos showing Mr. Jerí entering a restaurant and convenience store in Lima owned by Yang Zhihua, a wealthy Chinese businessman who has come under government scrutiny. Local outlets reported that one of Mr. Yang’s stores had been ordered closed for violating a municipal ordinance; three days later a national regulatory body overturned the law that led to the closure. Mr. Jerí acknowledged that the videos were authentic. Peruvian law requires presidents to log their official activities, and he did not report the visits to Mr. Yang’s establishments, Mr. Jerí admitted under questioning from lawmakers last month. During that questioning he declined to provide his phone records and said he had known Mr. Yang before becoming president. He added that the businessman had refused to let him pay for some candy and paintings he bought “because he was being kind to me.” The explanations failed to quell criticism. Lawmakers across the political spectrum called for his removal and the attorney general opened a corruption inquiry into Mr. Jerí’s interactions with Mr. Yang. Mr. Jerí has accused rivals of leaking the footage to influence the upcoming elections. Since the scandal erupted, Mr. Jerí’s approval ratings have dropped by 10 percentage points from his 51 percent rating, polls show . The controversy widened when Cuarto Poder, a television program that first broadcast the videos, reported that another Chinese businessman, Ji Wu Xiaodong — who is under house arrest while being investigated for alleged ties to an illegal logging network — had visited the presidential palace three times during Mr. Jerí’s tenure. The president told lawmakers that Mr. Ji Wu was a friend of Mr. Yang’s and said he did not know him well. The episode underscores Peru’s entrenched political instability epitomized by what has been the revolving door of the country’s presidency. Since 2016, a succession of presidents has been impeached, forced to resign or investigated. The upheaval comes after the removal four months ago of Dina Boluarte, one of the most unpopular presidents in recent decades, amid public anger over surging crime. Ms. Boluarte herself had ascended to the presidency in 2022 after her predecessor, Pedro Castillo — for whom she had served as vice president — tried to dissolve Congress and overhaul the judiciary. He was swiftly impeached and arrested, and last year he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for conspiracy and rebellion. That episode was only one in a long chain. Nearly every living former president has faced a criminal investigation. Alejandro Toledo, who served as president of Peru from 2001 to 2006, was sentenced to 20 years for accepting bribes, and Ollanta Humala, president from 2011 to 2016, was convicted of laundering campaign funds tied to Odebrecht, a Brazilian firm. Alberto Fujimori, Peru’s authoritarian leader of the 1990s, served more than a decade in prison for human rights abuses and corruption before a controversial pardon in 2023. He died in 2024 at 86.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Uber said on Wednesday that it would offer incentives to other companies to install electric vehicle chargers in the United States and Europe, a potential boost for a part of the car market that has been hurt by recent U.S. policy changes. The company said it would guarantee that chargers installed in neighborhoods where its drivers lived or often picked up or dropped off passengers would be used a minimum amount of time. The offer should allow charging operators to more quickly recoup their investment in new stations. How much chargers are used is a key to whether they make or lose money but difficult to predict. Sales of electric vehicles have slumped in the United States after Republicans in Congress and President Trump revoked various policies intended to encourage sales of cars with no tailpipe emissions. But construction of charging stations grew at a record pace last year despite the policy shift, in part because of Uber drivers like Charles Iwuoha, one of 13,000 ride-share drivers who use electric vehicles in New York City. He bought a Kia EV9, an electric sport utility vehicle, last year with financial help from Uber. The car’s battery lasts a full 10-hour shift, he said. And it costs him $20 to $40 less to charge the car than refueling the gasoline vehicle he previously owned. That is a significant savings, said Mr. Iwuoha, who lives in Queens. “New York rent is too high,” he said. Driving an Uber “pays the bills, but you’re just scraping by.” Ride-share drivers are among the heaviest users of public chargers, especially the kinds of devices that can top up a battery in half an hour or less, according to analysts and charging companies. The money that drivers for Uber, Lyft and other ride-hailing services pay to charge cars is a big reason for the growth in the number of charging stations. But chargers are not always built where Uber drivers need them. Mr. Iwuoha, for example, lives in an apartment building and cannot charge at home. He is dependent on fast public chargers, which are often crowded, especially in Manhattan. Pradeep Parameswaran, Uber’s global head of mobility, said his company hoped to alleviate some of those problems by getting 1,000 chargers built. “Over time, we think electrification helps bring down the cost of running their business on Uber,” he said in an interview. “And ultimately, it’s good for cities. It brings down emissions.” Jeroen van Tilburg, the chief executive of Ionity, a European charging company that is working with Uber, said Uber’s data would help it identify the best places to build chargers. “The biggest concern for every charge point operator is to identify the right location,” Mr. van Tilburg said. The stations built with Uber’s support will be open to anyone and could be particularly useful to renters and other urban residents who cannot charge at home. Uber said it was hoping to encourage new stations in New York, Los Angeles, Boston, San Francisco, London, Paris and Madrid. Uber also said on Wednesday that it would spend $100 million to build charging hubs for autonomous vehicles, which are almost always electric. Uber, whose business is potentially threatened by self-driving taxis, has been trying to position itself as a partner to companies like Waymo, a unit of Alphabet, Google’s parent company. In Austin, Texas, for example, Uber provides charging, cleaning and maintenance for Waymo’s taxis. Despite headwinds from Washington, the number of chargers in the United States increased 30 percent last year to 70,000 ports, according to Paren, a research firm that specializes in electric vehicle charging. That included a 44 percent increase in the last three months of the year, when electric vehicle sales plummeted after a tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of such models ended. Early figures for 2026 showed that growth remains strong, said Florent Breton, the chief executive of Paren. That is despite obstacles thrown up by the Trump administration. Last week, Sean Duffy, the secretary of transportation, proposed a rule that would require that chargers contain no parts manufactured outside the United States in order to receive federal funding under a program passed during the Biden administration. Electric vehicle experts say that’s an impossible standard to meet. But the practical effect of that proposal is limited because the large majority of chargers being installed in the United States receive no federal funding. Ride-share drivers are a big reason that demand for charging remains strong. Their cars account for about one quarter of the energy dispensed by EVgo, the third-largest U.S. operator of charging stations and an Uber partner. That compares with about 10 percent in 2021. “Electrification of ride share is something that we’ve been seeing quarter after quarter, year after year, for several years now,” Badar Khan, the chief executive of EVgo, said in an interview. “Anything that we can do in our partnership with Uber to increase the rollout of infrastructure will just accelerate the adoption of electrical vehicles.” Charging has become one of the main obstacles to buying an electric vehicle, according to drivers surveyed by Uber. Used electric vehicles sell for less than comparable gasoline models and are generally cheaper to fuel and maintain, according to calculations by the company. New electric vehicles cost more, but the gap is narrowing. Uber also offers drivers a $4,000 grant they can use to buy electric vehicles. (Drivers must log at least 100 trips to qualify.) Mr. Iwuoha, the Uber driver, said he had chosen an electric car in part because he was concerned about the environment, and in anticipation of New York regulations that will require all ride-share vehicles to be zero emission or handicapped accessible by 2030. He bought his Kia new before the $7,500 federal tax credit expired. If it were up to him, chargers would be available in the parking lots of public parks and at many more gas stations. “Time is money,” Mr. Iwuoha said.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT U.S. imports grew and the trade deficit remained historically large last year, data released Thursday showed, as steep tariffs imposed by President Trump scrambled trade but did not halt it. High tariffs and unpredictable policy drove huge swings in trade last year. Companies stockpiled products ahead of tariffs going into effect, then halted imports. American investors bought and sold large quantities of foreign gold as a hedge against volatile markets. But although hefty tariffs dampened purchases of imported cars, household consumer items and other goods somewhat, America’s trade with the world remained relatively robust. The United States imported chips to fill new artificial intelligence data centers and Americans snapped up foreign weight-loss drugs, all helping to buoy cross-border trade. The total trade deficit, including trade in both goods and services, shrank slightly last year, as growth in exports narrowly outpaced growth in imports. But that was entirely the result of an expanding trade surplus in services. The trade deficit in physical goods, which has been Mr. Trump’s focus as he has sought to use tariffs to restore the U.S. manufacturing sector, was the largest on record in 2025. Overall imports of goods and services increased 4.7 percent, to $4.3 trillion, in 2025, while exports rose 6.2 percent, to $3.4 trillion. The trade deficit — the amount by which imports exceed exports — was $901 billion, down from $903 billion in 2024. The trade deficit grew sharply at the end of the year, rising 32.6 percent in December as imports rose and exports fell. U.S. monthly imports Tariffs did lead to drastic shifts in the countries with which the United States trades. Trade with China slowed sharply as companies turned to factories in other parts of the world. The goods trade deficit with China fell to $202 billion, making it smaller than the deficit with the European Union. Trade deficits with other countries rose, however, as Americans bought more products from countries like Vietnam and Mexico instead. The data has raised questions about whether Mr. Trump’s trade policy is restructuring the United States to be less dependent on imports, or mostly shuffling trade around. Mr. Trump has said steep tariffs and new trade deals will boost American factory production, making the country less dependent on foreign goods. Many importers have responded to tariffs and the threat of them by adjusting the timing of deliveries, and the countries from which they purchase, at great cost and inconvenience . But whether the policies lead to lower imports, higher exports and a narrower trade deficit in the long run still appears something of an open question. Bernard Yaros, the lead economist at Oxford Economics, said it was “a bit too early to tell what the lasting impacts of Trump’s trade policies are.” He said U.S. imports were now hovering below their trend from the decade before Mr. Trump’s second term. Part of that was payback for the huge spike in imports at the start of last year, and part was the impact of tariffs had on the relative price of imports rising. “We still need to see where imports settle once the ‘inventory effect’ from massive stockpiling in early 2025 wears off,” he added. After Mr. Trump’s election, companies had rushed to bring goods into the country before tariffs took effect, causing imports and the trade deficit to soar. Imports began to fall back after Mr. Trump announced global tariffs in April, including draconian levies on China. The president temporarily paused most of those tariffs to allow for trade negotiations, but reimposed them at lower levels in August. As of Jan. 19, U.S. consumers faced an overall average tariff rate of 16.9 percent, the highest since 1932, according to calculations by the Yale Budget Lab. In recent months, the trade deficit has fallen, one of Mr. Trump’s goals. In October, the trade deficit fell to the lowest monthly figure since June 2009. But much of that drop appeared to be the result of temporary fluctuations in trade, particularly in gold. The trade deficit rebounded somewhat in November before growing further in December. The president has long seen trade deficits as a sign of a weak U.S. economy, and argued that high tariffs would encourage more U.S. factory production and cause the trade deficit to fall. Many economists disagree with a single-minded focus on the metric, saying that the trade deficit can fall for many reasons, not all of them good. The tariffs have also shuffled U.S. trade with various countries. In particular, the trade deficit with China has shrunk, as companies rejiggered their supply chains in anticipation of higher tariffs on the country. But Brad Setser, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that American tariffs on Chinese exports had not ended up being that much higher that tariffs on goods from other parts of Asia, raising the question of whether companies would continue moving supply chains out of China. Mr. Setser said that the United States had also simply started importing more from elsewhere in Asia. The drop in the U.S. trade deficit with China was mostly offset by a big rise in the U.S. trade deficit with Vietnam, other countries in Southeast Asia, India and Taiwan last year. In some cases, shipments to the United States from elsewhere in Asia have still come from Chinese companies. Chinese firms have set up new factories outside of China to be able to export to the United States without paying the higher tariffs. China’s trade statistics show that, while its trade surplus with the United States has fallen, its trade surplus with the rest of the world has soared, Mr. Setser said. “The administration is trying to get far too much credit for shifting imports around a bit and moving to a world where Chinese content comes to the U.S. on a one-stop flight rather than on a nonstop,” he said. “The goods coming through Southeast Asia have enormously significant amounts of Chinese content.” Trade from Asia remained strong in part because Mr. Trump chose to exempt electronics from his tariffs last year. The region continued to provide Americans with tax-free electronics, as well as semiconductors and other equipment necessary for data centers. The administration also did not end up putting meaningful tariffs on foreign pharmaceuticals, and imports of drugs helped to push up the trade deficit. Tariffs could undergo more changes in the weeks to come. The Supreme Court is expected to rule , potentially as soon as Friday, on the legality of many of the tariffs that Mr. Trump issued using a 1970s emergency law. Trump officials have said that if those tariffs were struck down, they would use other authorities to impose new duties to replace them.

In today's newsletter: Who will blink first? “You’re mischaracterizing this” “At a certain point, for some firms, it’s a publicity stunt.” EBay shops in the secondhand aisle Andrew here. We’ve been talking for months about potential problems in the private credit market. Well, here’s a new sign: Blue Owl Capital, one of the biggest private credit fund companies — which partnered with Meta recently to finance construction of a huge data center — has halted redemptions from retail investors. Keep an eye on this space. Meanwhile, we go deep into oil prices rising amid the continued tension with Iran and explore Niko Gallogly’s scoop on Wednesday on Etsy’s sale of Depop to eBay. Who will blink first? The U.S. has continued to build up its military presence in the Middle East, and The Times reports that President Trump is weighing possible strikes against Iran as soon as this weekend. The prospect of more military action — in one of the world’s most volatile regions — has markets on edge. The latest: Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, climbed above $71 a barrel on Thursday, a level it last reached in July. S&P 500 futures and stocks in Europe were down. President Trump has called on Tehran to give up its nuclear program, and stop enriching uranium. U.S. and Iranian officials have held indirect talks in Geneva, but some administration officials have grown skeptical that a breakthrough is achievable, and Israel has been making preparations for a possible war, The Times reports. Tehran has been more upbeat. Officials say they have reached a “ set of guiding principles ” with Washington after talks. Oil prices could surge if talks collapse , analysts say. Military action carries economic and political risks for Trump, threatening to reignite inflation. Trump campaigned on fighting inflation and lowering energy bills, and falling gasoline prices have been a rare bright spot amid a wider affordability crunch. But military intervention in a key route for global oil supplies and shipping could hit households hard. How high could prices go? A major attack on Iran could push oil prices to near $90 per barrel, Jorge León, a senior vice president and the head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy, an independent research firm, wrote to clients earlier this month. Others see more dire consequences. “It is our understanding that senior officials from the region had warned the White House that a war with Iran in the current environment could send prices to triple-digit levels,” Helima Croft, the head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, wrote to investors on Wednesday. Those officials are hoping that potential “calamitous outcome” would prompt Trump to “seek a Greenland-esque off-ramp,” she said, referring to his retreat from threats to seize the semiautonomous island from Denmark. Image HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING Walmart says that consumer price increases should slow down. The retail giant reported that sales in the fourth quarter grew 6 percent year-on-year, beating expectations, though it gave a weaker-than-anticipated financial forecast because of potential labor and trade challenges. John David Rainey, Walmart’s C.F.O., told CNBC that price increases partly spurred by President Trump’s tariffs should ease in the coming months , and that retailers had largely “absorbed” the brunt of their costs. Fed officials appear to be in no rush to cut rates. Minutes from the central bank’s meeting last month showed deep divisions among policymakers. Several support holding borrowing costs steady unless inflation cools further. Higher rates could be justified, too, if inflation remains above target. The minutes suggest that President Trump’s choice to succeed Jay Powell as Fed chair, Kevin Warsh, would face resistance if he tries to push for quick, substantial rate cuts, as the president has demanded. Trump reportedly intervenes in Moderna’s flu shot application. The F.D.A. has decided to reverse course and review the application for a seasonal flu vaccine — a move that came after Trump pressured the agency’s commissioner, Dr. Marty Makary, in a White House meeting , according to Politico. (A White House official denied the report.) Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, has been critical of the mRNA technology which the shot uses, and canceled $500 million in federal funding for mRNA vaccine development projects last year. Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor is arrested. Former Prince Andrew of Britain, who turns 66 on Thursday, was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of misconduct in public office after accusations that he shared confidential information with Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender, while serving as a British trade envoy. Several politicians and business officials who were in Epstein’s orbit have lost their jobs since the files were released, but arrests have been rare. Image “You’re mischaracterizing this” After more than a week of courtroom proceedings, the most anticipated witness in a landmark social media trial finally took the stand: Mark Zuckerberg. Over several hours, Zuckerberg, Meta’s C.E.O., faced tough questions about what his company knew about efforts to hook users on its apps — and repeatedly pushed back against accusations that its products are as addictive and harmful as substances like cigarettes. Zuckerberg was peppered with questions about Meta’s metrics. Lawyers for the plaintiff, a California woman identified as K.G.M., referred to internal documents about user engagement. Among them: In a 2015 email , Zuckerberg wrote that his goal for 2016 was to grow users’ time spent on the company’s platforms by 12 percent. Zuckerberg responded that while the company once focused on time spent, it doesn’t anymore “because I don’t think that’s the best way to do it.” Another internal document showed that in 2015, about four million children in the U.S. used Instagram — even though children under 13 aren’t allowed to create accounts. Zuckerberg said that the company removed any accounts held by underage users that it found and that its terms of service include age requirements. A lawyer for the plaintiff shot back, “You expect a 9-year-old to read all of the fine print.” Zuckerberg also faced questions about his control over Meta. A plaintiff’s lawyer asked the C.E.O. about his appearance on “The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast in which he said that, because of his voting power at the company, “I have the benefit of not having to convince the board not to fire me.” Elements of Zuckerberg’s defense included pushing back against claims by the plaintiff’s lawyers — “You’re mischaracterizing this” was a frequent rejoinder — and admissions that he wasn’t good at speaking publicly. (When asked if he had extensive media training, Zuckerberg joked, “I’m actually well-known to be sort of bad at this.”) The stakes are high for Zuckerberg and Meta. K.G.M.’s trial is one of thousands of cases filed against tech giants centered on the addictiveness of social media. By focusing on the structure of apps like Instagram, the plaintiffs are seeking to get around a longstanding legal shield that protects companies from liability for content users post on their platforms. (Several countries and U.S. states are also weighing bans on social media for teens, in many cases, for those under 15 or 16.) Worth noting: Judge Carolyn Kuhl ordered observers in the courtroom to remove smart glasses like those made by Meta to prevent them from potentially recording the proceedings. Neal Mohan, the head of YouTube, was scheduled to testify this week but was removed from the witness list. (Two other companies that were initially defendants in this lawsuit, Snap and TikTok, settled with K.G.M. for undisclosed terms.) “At a certain point, for some firms, it’s a publicity stunt.” — David L",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Shoppers looking to stretch their paychecks continue to turn to Walmart, with the nation’s largest retailer saying on Thursday that it expects to maintain the solid pace of sales growth it achieved last year. Yet company executives are wary of the uncertain U.S. economy, issuing a relatively tepid profit forecast amid a fragile job market, unpredictable trade policies and the struggles of low-income consumers. U.S. households are grappling with stubborn inflation but have been buoyed by strong hiring at the beginning of the year. The economy added 130,000 jobs in January and the unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent. Walmart has performed well in this environment, with sales up 5.6 percent, to $190.7 billion, in its most recent quarter, driven by momentum in both the United States and abroad. Across retail, shoppers still spent big throughout the holiday season despite the economic pressures as they looked for discounts, compared prices and used buy now, pay later programs. In a presentation to investors on Thursday, Walmart said that growth at its U.S. stores was “led by upper-income households.” Wealthier Americans, buoyed by the stock market, have continued to spend freely as lower-income households have pulled back, an increasingly stark phenomenon known as the K-shaped economy . U.S. big box stores began a new era this month as Walmart and its rival Target each welcomed new chief executives on Feb. 1. Target’s new boss, Michael Fiddelke, faces a turnaround effort from his base in Minneapolis, but Walmart’s John Furner steps into a much healthier situation at the retailer’s headquarters in Bentonville, Ark. Just days after Mr. Furner replaced Doug McMillon, Walmart surpassed $1 trillion in market value, joining a club of corporations that consists largely of technology giants like Apple and Microsoft. Walmart’s shares slipped in premarket trading on Thursday, as investors assessed the company’s lighter-than-expected profit forecast. Under Mr. McMillon, who ran the retailer for 12 years, Walmart transformed into a digital powerhouse and lured wealthier shoppers to its stores and website by improving its mix of merchandise in categories like beauty, apparel and furniture. It also expanded its selection of private label goods to add trendy fashion and food. Mr. Furner is expected to accelerate Walmart’s push to become a high-tech retailer. In January, he sat onstage at a retail conference in Manhattan alongside Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, to declare that artificial intelligence was the future of retail. The pair announced a partnership to expand A.I.-powered shopping. “The future is fast, convenient and personalized,” Mr. Furner said in a statement accompanying Walmart’s earnings on Thursday. Mr. Furner, who has worked at Walmart for more than three decades and previously ran its U.S. business, must now guide the retailer through a transitional period. In January, the company made several changes to top staff, naming a new chief growth officer and new leaders for Walmart U.S., Walmart International and its Sam’s Club business.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Uber is taking steps to enact stricter background checks, after a New York Times investigation in December revealed that the ride-hailing giant’s policies allowed for drivers with many types of criminal convictions, including violent felonies. The company had barred drivers convicted of murder, sexual assault, kidnapping and terrorism. But in 22 states, The Times found, the company had approved people convicted of most other crimes — including violent felonies, child abuse, assault and stalking — so long as the convictions were at least seven years old. Now, Uber is preparing to change those policies to bar people convicted of violent felonies, sexual offenses, and child or elder abuse and endangerment from driving for Uber, regardless of when those crimes occurred, according to people briefed on the matter. It is unclear when and how the changes will go into effect. The company also is considering changing its policies for other offenses, including harassment, restraining order violations and weapons charges, which are generally allowed if the convictions are more than seven years old. Uber declined to specifically comment on the changes. “Safety isn’t static, and our approach isn’t, either,” an Uber spokesman, Matt Kallman, said in a statement. “We listen, we learn, we speak with experts and we evolve as the world changes. We believe that’s the hallmark of a healthy, effective safety culture.” The company has long maintained that it is one of the safest ways to get around, with 99.9 percent of rides occurring without an incident of any kind. Previously, Uber said the seven-year cutoff for felony convictions “strikes the right balance between protecting public safety and giving people with older criminal records a chance to work and rebuild their lives.” A series of Times investigations revealed that Uber received a report of sexual assault or sexual misconduct in the United States almost every eight minutes on average between 2017 and 2022 — far more than what the company has publicly disclosed. Uber executives have long been aware of the extensiveness of sexual violence, The Times found, yet they repeatedly prioritized expanding their business over introducing stronger protections, such as automatic video recording. The Times also found that the company allowed many drivers with records of complaints to keep driving — until passengers accused them of serious sexual assault. Image Uber has long maintained that it is one of the safest ways to get around, with 99.9 percent of rides occurring without an incident of any kind. Credit... Andres Kudacki for The New York Times Women who reported being sexually assaulted during Uber rides had said the company’s vetting practices put them in harm’s way. For example , in 2020, an Uber driver in San Diego with felony convictions for assault with a deadly weapon was reported to the police for using his fingers to forcibly penetrate a passenger’s vagina, then choking her and throwing her phone out the window when she tried to fight back. The next year, an Uber driver in Tampa, Fla., with eight felony convictions, including for robbery with a firearm in 2002, was reported to the police for raping a passenger who had been out celebrating her 21st birthday. And in 2022, an Uber driver in Florida who was on parole after a decade in prison for two violent felonies was reported to the police for raping a passenger. The changes to Uber’s background check policies come as the company faces increased scrutiny over its safety record from lawmakers, investors and others. In California, for instance, a proposed ballot initiative would make ride-hailing companies legally responsible for sexual misconduct and assault against drivers and passengers. This year, in Virginia, lawmakers have introduced a pair of bills with stricter regulations for background checks, among other measures. “Drivers were slipping through the cracks,” said Lily Franklin, a House delegate who introduced one of the bills after reading the Times investigation. “There needs to be reform.” Uber has publicly supported both bills. This month, a federal jury in Phoenix ordered Uber to pay $8.5 million to a passenger who said a driver had raped her. Uber argued that it was not responsible for the misconduct of drivers on its platform, whom it classifies as independent contractors, not employees. But the jury rejected that defense, providing a road map for more than 3,000 pending sexual assault and sexual misconduct lawsuits that accuse the company of systemic safety failures. Uber, which fended off other claims in the case, including that it was negligent in its safety practices, has said it plans to appeal the verdict. Emily Steel is an investigative reporter covering business for The Times. She has uncovered sexual misconduct at major companies and recently has focused on the ride-hailing industry.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Jamie Siminoff, the founder and chief inventor of Ring, the ubiquitous doorbell camera, was excited for the company’s first Super Bowl television commercial. The 30-second ad presented its product helping with a task as unassailable as apple pie: finding lost dogs. But since the ad aired, instead of a victory lap, Mr. Siminoff has been on an apology tour. Or maybe an explanation tour. Whatever you call it, he is responding to a genuine public relations crisis. The commercial showed a new Ring feature called Search Party, which uses artificial intelligence and images from its cameras to trace a lost pet’s wanderings across a neighborhood. Critics said the feature felt dystopian, showing the potential for far-reaching invasive surveillance. Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and a critic of corporate data collection, called out “the serious privacy and civil liberties risks” in Ring’s technology. This week, Mr. Siminoff has made the rounds on TV news shows, trying to allay users’ concerns. He has been on CNN and NBC and talked to The New York Times on Wednesday. The ad landed at a tense media moment involving home surveillance. In the search for Nancy Guthrie, the missing mother of the TV news anchor Savannah Guthrie, law enforcement agencies were able to recover footage from her Google Nest doorbell, despite reports that she did not have a subscription to the device. But Ring, which is owned by Amazon, is so ubiquitous that is has become a generic term for any doorbell camera, and users raised questions about how much Ring was monitoring them. Mr. Siminoff took pains in his media appearances to clarify Ring’s privacy policies. He said his company does not store users’ footage if they don’t have a subscription with Ring. “You have the A.I. angst, you have the Nancy Guthrie thing happening,” Mr. Siminoff said, offering his explanation as to why the Super Bowl ad created such an outcry. “All this came together and it created a perfect storm and it just hit and exploded.” Image A scene from Ring’s Super Bowl ad shows radiating blue circles representing Ring cameras activated to find a lost dog with the Search Party feature. Mr. Siminoff said the image might have been “triggering.” Credit... Ring Ring is trying to balance communicating what it does — using video to monitor homes and neighborhoods — and not agitating people who are wary of that very thing. Mr. Siminoff defended his technology, saying that protecting privacy and providing useful tools for helping people are both possible. He said that he understood people’s concerns, and that maybe people were “triggered” by an image in the ad that showed blue rings radiating out from suburban homes. There will be fewer maps in any future ads, he said. But the company had come under criticism, even before the Super Bowl ad, from people like Mr. Markey. Last week, Ring ended its partnership with Flock Safety, which operates A.I.-powered surveillance cameras that critics feared would allow government agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement to gain access to user data. The partnership would have given Flock access to a tool to work with local law enforcement. The company said users had to agree before their information was shared on Search Party. While the feature is on outdoor Ring cameras by default, “camera owners always control how their footage is shared in response to a Search Party request,” Meredith Chiricosta, a spokeswoman for Ring, said in an emailed statement. “Nothing is shared by default.” Mr. Siminoff, who started Ring in his garage in Los Angeles, remains resolute that more video in the world is better. He believes that most people feel this way, too, even if they say they have misgivings. “I think there’s been a lot of cases recently where if the video had not been there, I’m not sure if the story would have been told the same or we wouldn’t have known what happened,” he said. But he gets that people want to have some measure of control. “That’s the balance. It’s not just like unfettered mass surveillance,” he said. “That’s not what we have with Ring. You get to choose what you want to do with your individual home.” Davia Temin, a longtime corporate crisis strategist, said Mr. Siminoff was emphasizing the most important point in this particular maelstrom. “A C.E.O. who acknowledges that his company wants to give as much control to the consumer as possible — that is as healthy as it gets,” Ms. Temin, who runs the communications firm Davia Temin & Company, said. “Privacy will always be contested until we get to the next step.” While the outcry over its Super Bowl commercial was intense, Mr. Siminoff, who had appeared in the ad with his dog Biscuit, said the company would move forward building out the Search Party feature. It hopes to be able to help people find their lost cats, a harder problem to solve than dogs. “One of the biggest controversies we had for Search Party,” Mr. Siminoff said, “up until the Super Bowl commercial, was why don’t you have cats?” Jordyn Holman is a Times business reporter covering management and writing the Corner Office column.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Earlier this month, President Trump found the latest pressure point to extend his leverage over Canada: a new bridge connecting the country to the United States that is expected to open this year. Mr. Trump threatened to block the opening, just hours after the billionaire owner of a competing U.S.-Canada bridge met with Howard Lutnick , Mr. Trump’s commerce secretary. It wasn’t that the president was particularly passionate about the new bridge. What excited him, officials familiar with his thinking said, was the opportunity to use the bridge to force Canada to make trade concessions. “I will not allow this bridge to open until the United States is fully compensated for everything we have given them, and also, importantly, Canada treats the United States with the Fairness and Respect that we deserve,” Mr. Trump said on social media on Feb. 9. The threat was a preview of the high-pressure tactics the president is expected to deploy when his administration renegotiates a trade deal with Canada and Mexico. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Mr. Trump signed into law during his first term, is set to be reviewed by the summer. U.S. officials have been raising pressure on Canada to get it to concede to their demands over trade and other issues. Mr. Trump’s threat to block the Detroit-to-Windsor bridge was the latest in a series of flash points that Mr. Trump has capitalized on to needle Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada. In October, Mr. Trump suspended trade talks over an advertisement featuring a historical address by President Ronald Reagan decrying tariffs , which was paid for by the Province of Ontario and aired in the United States. Mr. Carney apologized. The Trump administration has a list of things it wants Mr. Carney to concede, including longstanding grievances about protected industries in Canada, including the dairy sector. Another pressing issue for the U.S. administration is the fact that liquor distributors controlled by Ontario and other provincial governments in Canada pulled U.S. liquor off their shelves last year, in retaliation against Mr. Trump’s tariffs on Canada. Trump administration officials have also been irked by Mr. Carney’s global charm offensive as he seeks to bolster Canada’s trade relationships with other countries, including China. Responding to a modest tariff deal that Mr. Carney struck during a visit to Beijing last month , Mr. Trump threatened to impose 100 percent tariffs on Canadian goods, and claimed that China would “take over” Canada and even ban hockey. He also responded bitterly to Mr. Carney’s speech in Davos , Switzerland, where he said that the era of a U.S.-led global order was over and that middle powers like Canada should band together to defend their interests. “Canada lives because of the United States,” Mr. Trump said the day after Mr. Carney’s Davos speech. “Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.” The spats haven’t resulted in new tariffs, but they form the acrimonious backdrop against which the two countries enter trade talks in earnest this year. The text of the U.S.M.C.A. says the review must be completed by July 2026. Mr. Trump and his advisers have indicated that the three-country pact could be scrapped altogether. Instead, the United States could end up with bilateral deals with Canada and Mexico, the advisers have suggested. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. That could be catastrophic for companies that have structured their business around the trade agreement. Trillions of dollars of trade happens under the pact, and leaving it could cause pain for American farmers and automakers and dent U.S. economic growth. Some trade experts and executives believe the idea of abandoning the North American trade deal is probably a pressure tactic from a president who has walked back from some of his biggest economic threats. But Mr. Trump has been dismissive when asked about the future of the agreement. “There’s no real advantage to it — it’s irrelevant,” he said in January. “Canada wants it. They need it.” Image The Trump administration has a list of things it wants Mark Carney, the prime minister of Canada, to concede. Credit... Ian Austen for The New York Times The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico despite the U.S.M.C.A. In Canada, those are hitting important pockets of the economy hard: Lumber, autos, steel and aluminum are particularly hurting. But the current arrangement does leave most of the U.S.-Canada trade tariff-free, as it does with Mexico. The president created major exemptions to his tariffs last year for goods that follow the rules of U.S.M.C.A. That has led to a rush of companies trading under the pact’s terms, and significantly brought down the average U.S. tariff rate. Data released on Thursday showed trade between the United States and Canada slowing in 2025. The trade deficit with Canada shrank to $46.4 billion in 2025 from $62 billion the prior year. But that was because both imports and exports fell as the United States bought less from Canada and sold less to its northern neighbor. In an interview with The New York Times in January , Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, said that the administration wanted to keep things in the agreement that were working, but that there was no “natural reason” that U.S.M.C.A. needed to be one pact. The United States would discuss energy production, corn sales and labor issues with Mexico, while the main issues with Canada included dairy, electricity transmission and digital regulation, he said. “We’re not wedded to any particular agreement or format of an agreement simply because it’s there,” Mr. Greer said. He said the administration’s priority was to bring manufacturing jobs to the United States, encourage wage growth and shrink the U.S. trade deficit . “The president’s been quite clear,” Mr. Greer said in a second interview this month. “He’s half inclined to leave. So we’ll see how that goes.” Mr. Greer helped negotiate and pass U.S.M.C.A. through Congress during Mr. Trump’s first term, as chief of staff to Robert E. Lighthizer, who was then the trade representative. But he is not afraid of changing the agreement, people close to him say. Mr. Greer last summer began urging a more disruptive approach to U.S.M.C.A. negotiations, saying its current form wasn’t working for the United States, one person who spoke with him said. One outcome of that approach could involve the president’s withdrawing from the agreement and replacing it with two separate deals, the person said. U.S. officials are unhappy with Canada’s continued protections for its dairy industry, among other issues. To keep talks on track last year, Mr. Carney dropped Canada’s planned digital services tax , which the United States had criticized, but the concession did not seem to advance talks. The U.S. administration has also criticized Mexico for welcoming investment from Chinese factories, which can then export their products to the United States under the preferential terms of the trade deal. The Canadian government is bracing for a rupture and weighing the financial and political costs of changing domestic policies that protect socially and economically sensitive industries, in exchange for a trade deal with the United States. Two Canadian officials involved in the U.S. trade discussions, who spoke anonymously to frankly convey their impressions of the state of the talks, said expectations in Ottawa for a full renewal of the U.S.M.C.A. were very low. Mr. Carney’s team, they said, even questions whether it could trust any fresh trade agreements with Mr. Trump. The Canadian government, they said, is preparing for long, bumpy and dramatic talks with a hostile U.S. administration, and even for a breakup of the U.S.M.C.A. Mr. Trump repeatedly said last year that he wanted Canada to become part of the United States — calling it the 51st state — and that he wa",

The India A.I. Impact Summit has been a whirl of more than 300 exhibitors and 500 sessions, sprawled across 120 acres of New Delhi this week. The organizers expected 250,000 participants and visitors. A fleet of world leaders arrived, including President Emmanuel Macron of France, the keynote speaker, and President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil. The tech world is well represented: Google, Microsoft and all of India’s big companies sent their bosses. This summit is the fourth in an annual series on A.I. that began at Bletchley Park in Britain in 2023, before moving to Seoul and then to Paris . The headline topics of the earlier meetings were motivated by fear of doomsday scenarios, like the prospect of A.I.’s turning into a sentient overlord, and sought to devise regulations to make it safer. India’s version is draped in announcements about business deals and billions in investment, as well as entrepreneurs touting clever fixes to real-world problems. The host, of course, is India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, whose face is featured on billboards for the event that span India’s capital. He spoke on Thursday, before a long program of tech leaders. “We must give A.I. an open sky, and keep the command in our hands,” Mr. Modi said. Home to 1.5 billion people and the fastest-growing of the large economies, India is an appealing venue for the world’s exuberant A.I. investors and engineers. While investors see an opportunity, India is off to a slow start on A.I. development relative to the United States or China. With a huge and underemployed work force, India does not look like a natural fit for the labor-saving promise of A.I. India is short on the land, water and electricity needed for data centers . India brims with tech talent but not the companies that command it. Image The India A.I. Impact Summit unfolded across 120 acres in New Delhi and was expected to draw 250,000 people. Credit... Saumya Khandelwal for The New York Times Image The event featured 300 exhibitors. Credit... Saumya Khandelwal for The New York Times In his nearly 12 years in office, Mr. Modi has espoused the power of technology to transform the lives of the masses. He backed an existing biometric-ID system to the hilt, helping to stitch hundreds of millions of Indians into the world’s biggest real-time digital payments system . His allies distinguish India’s A.I. potential from the American approach, which has benefited mainly the private sector, and China’s, which strengthens state control. Muzzammil Sabuwala, 22, a social media content creator from Mumbai in the process of becoming an A.I. entrepreneur, expressed a popular conviction: “If you stay active with this tech, and not dependent on it, you will find success.” Ashwini Vaishnaw, the cabinet minister in charge of India’s A.I. policy, said $200 billion worth of A.I. investment was expected in India, much of it flowing from abroad. The American A.I. company Anthropic, represented at the summit by its chief executive, Dario Amodei, announced a deal with Infosys, a giant among India’s first-generation tech firms. The two companies said they would integrate the services they offered to clients, such as regulatory compliance reporting and precision engineering. Infosys, along with other big Indian I.T. firms, has been battered for months by a stock sell-off on fears that A.I. threatens its business model. On Tuesday, the share price of Infosys sprang up 5 percent. OpenAI, the Silicon Valley force behind ChatGPT, and Tata Consulting Services announced a similar collaboration, to develop A.I. infrastructure for India and to train more Tata Consulting employees to apply the tools in their work.

Saumya Khandelwal for The New York Times Claude, Anthropic’s main large language model, already counts India as its second-largest market, accounting for almost 6 percent of its worldwide usage. Such A.I. systems learn by digesting vast amounts of words and images, making India, with its massive population and numerous languages, a great place to do business. OpenAI also sees an enormous market in India. Amitabh Kant, a former government official, said Indian users now shared 33 percent more data with OpenAI’s ChatGPT than Americans did. India consumes more data than any other country. The companies running so-called frontier A.I. models and those that build data centers and the infrastructure they require are scrambling to keep up with demand. This year, OpenAI will set up an office in India, its first in the country. Sam Altman, its founder, told a U.S. congressional committee last week that the future of artificial intelligence was contested between an “American-led, democratic A.I.” and China’s ruling Chinese Communist Party. This week’s show was marred by delays and logistical confusion, which is typical of many enormous events in India but not the way the Indian government wanted to present itself to the A.I. world. On Wednesday, it was announced that the convention center would be closed on Thursday, to make way for eminences like Mr. Modi and Mr. Macron, and that an extra day had been added to the summit. And shortly before the summit was to begin, Jensen Huang, the founder of Nvidia, the Silicon Valley company that supplies most of the chips that run A.I. data centers, canceled his appearance. The American billionaire Bill Gates was supposed to give an address on Thursday, but canceled just hours before to “ensure the focus remains on the A.I. Summit’s key priorities,” according to his foundation. Mr. Gates has attracted attention for his presence in the Epstein files. One exhibitor at the summit, an Indian university, was kicked out after being accused of passing off a Chinese robo-dog as its own. Still, there were heaps of deals to announce, featuring big players from inside and outside the A.I. sphere. Blackstone, the private equity firm, put $600 million into Neysa , an Indian cloud-services provider. Each of India’s biggest three dominant industrial conglomerates — the Adani Group, Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance and Tata — are pouring money into new data centers. The Adani Group pledged $100 billion to construct data centers powered by clean energy by 2035. India’s government is ready to spend billions on projects ranging from rural nursery workers to surveillance along its border with China. Image Credit...

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT By almost every metric, the Chinese carmaker BYD looks unstoppable. After a decade of struggling to establish itself in the automobile industry, BYD has surpassed Tesla to become the world’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer. The company’s sales are rapidly expanding in Europe and Latin America, and new and potentially lucrative markets like Canada could soon open to it. But investors are cooling on BYD’s ascent from a little-known battery maker to the top of the automotive world’s fast-growing segment. The company’s stock has fallen roughly 40 percent from its peak last May, making it among the hardest-hit names in a broader sell-off in Chinese E.V. stocks that accelerated last week after companies reported weak sales numbers for January. Intense competition is crushing profit margins, government subsidies are vanishing, and faster production cycles mean that no company can hold a lead for long. BYD is emblematic of how Chinese electric vehicle companies are becoming victims of their own success. The domestic market, fueled partly by government subsidies, has grown rapidly, but Chinese companies are “maxing out the number of people for whom it makes sense” to buy one, said John Paul MacDuffie, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Sales are concentrated in major cities where charging infrastructure is more developed, while owning an electric vehicle simply isn’t practical in much of the rest of the country. Now, BYD and other carmakers must convert one-time buyers into repeat customers, building the kind of long-term brand relationships that more established automakers have relied on. “BYD has grown so fast that they’re running out of new domestic customers,” Mr. MacDuffie said. The challenges of China’s E.V. market started to surface last month. After growing 28 percent last year, BYD’s electric vehicle deliveries in January fell about 33 percent from a year earlier. Overall sales of new electric vehicles fell nearly 20 percent, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. BYD did not respond to a request for comment. The company attributed the decline to weak domestic demand, according to a statement posted on WeChat. The slowing growth coincides with a reduction in Chinese government subsidies. For years, Beijing waived its 10 percent tax on new car purchases. But this year, it reimposed the tax at half the original rate. The full tax is expected to return after 2027. Another factor is the constant influx of new competition. In 2025, nearly 400 electric vehicle models were for sale in China, more than double the number in 2019, according to JATO, an automotive market research firm. More than 100 of those were released in the past two years. Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington, said the industry was entering a wartime period. The number of car companies will have to shrink from hundreds to just a handful for the industry to be sustainable in the long run, he said. Image A Geely factory in Ningbo, China. Chinese carmakers build huge factories and roll out one new model after another, betting that volume will eventually make up for shrinking profits. Credit... Qilai Shen for The New York Times Fierce competition among carmakers has pushed prices into a downward spiral known in China as “ involution ,” in which companies keep cutting costs and adding features just to survive, even when it hurts everyone’s bottom line. Carmakers built huge factories and rolled out one new model after another, betting that volume would eventually make up for shrinking profits. The country is building a new kind of automotive industry, said Tu Le, a transportation and technology analyst — one that looks less like Detroit and more like Silicon Valley. Automotive cycles now resemble those of consumer electronics, with new models and feature changes released every year. While Ford Motor’s F-series truck has been the best-selling vehicle in America for the past 40 years , the top spot in China over the past few years has been held by either BYD, Geely or Tesla. When preferences change that fast, factories built for boom times don’t scale back as quickly, leaving excess capacity. Mike Smitka, an automotive industry expert and emeritus professor at Washington and Lee University, estimated that 40 percent of China’s automotive production capacity was unused. Those idle factories have further contributed to a glut of new models. Companies can commission existing factories to build their cars instead of establishing their own plants. Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, sells numerous electric vehicles, but it does not produce the cars itself. But even under strain, Chinese carmakers pose a threat to American automakers, which are doubling down on gas-powered trucks and sport utility vehicles rather than continuing to spend on electric vehicles. Ford and Stellantis each recorded multibillion-dollar losses after scaling back their electric vehicle plans this year. And even Tesla ceded its early advantage in electric vehicles to BYD last year. So far, 100 percent tariffs have kept Chinese electric vehicles out of the United States. But Mr. Le said it was only a matter of time. The rest of the world has already started the shift to electric, but “the U.S. just hasn’t gotten that memo yet.” Joy Dong contributed research.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT For months, the Department of Defense and the artificial intelligence company Anthropic have been negotiating a contract over the use of A.I. on classified systems by the Pentagon. This week, those discussions erupted in a war of words. On Monday, a person close to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told Axios that the Pentagon was “close” to declaring the start-up a “supply chain risk,” a move that would sever ties between the company and the U.S. military. Anthropic was caught off guard and internally scrambled to pinpoint what had set off the department, two people with knowledge of the company said. At the heart of the fight is how A.I. will be used in future battlefields. Anthropic told defense officials that it did not want its A.I. used for mass surveillance of Americans or deployed in autonomous weapons that had no humans in the loop, two people involved in the discussions said. But Mr. Hegseth and others in the Pentagon were furious that Anthropic would resist the military’s using A.I. as it saw fit, current and former officials briefed on the discussions said. As tensions escalated, the Department of Defense accused the San Francisco-based company of catering to an elite, liberal work force by demanding additional protections. The disagreement underlines how political the issue of A.I. has become in the Trump administration. President Trump and his advisers want to expand technology’s use, reducing export restrictions on A.I. chips and criticizing state regulations that could be perceived as inhibitors to A.I. development. But Anthropic’s chief executive, Dario Amodei, has long said A.I. needs strict limits around it to prevent it from potentially wrecking the world. Image Dario Amodei, Anthropic’s chief executive, recently wrote that “using A.I. for domestic mass surveillance and mass propaganda” seemed “entirely illegitimate” to him. Credit... Karsten Moran for The New York Times Emelia Probasco, a senior fellow at Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, said it was important that the relationship between the Pentagon and Anthropic not be doomed. “There are war fighters using Anthropic for good and legitimate purposes, and ripping this out of their hands seems like a total disservice,” she said. “What the nation needs is both sides at the table discussing what can we do with this technology to make us safer.” In a statement, Sean Parnell, the Pentagon spokesman, said the department’s relationship with Anthropic was “being reviewed.” “Our nation requires that our partners be willing to help our war fighters win in any fight,” he said. “Ultimately, this is about our troops and the safety of the American people.” Anthropic said it was committed to using its A.I. to support U.S. national security and was “having productive conversations, in good faith, with the Department of War on how to continue that work and get these complex issues right.” A Pentagon official praised the other A.I. companies that have been working on the Pentagon’s unclassified systems. The official said the department had an agreement in place for one of the firms to begin work on the classified system, replacing Anthropic. The Defense Department has used Anthropic’s technology for more than a year as part of a $200 million A.I. pilot program to analyze imagery and other intelligence data and conduct research. Google, OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI are also part of the program. But Anthropic’s A.I. chatbot, Claude, was the most widely used by the agency — and the only one on classified systems — thanks to its integration with technology from Palantir, a data analytics company that works with the federal government, according to defense officials with knowledge of the technology. (The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft, accusing them of copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The companies have denied those claims.) On Jan. 9, Mr. Hegseth released a memo calling on A.I. companies to remove restrictions on their technology. The memo led A.I. companies including Anthropic to renegotiate their contracts. Anthropic asked for limits to how its A.I. tools could be deployed. Anthropic has long been more vocal than other A.I. companies on safety issues. In a podcast interview in 2023, Dr. Amodei said there was a 10 to 25 percent chance that A.I. could destroy humanity . Internally, the company has strict guidelines that bar its technology from being used to facilitate violence. In January, Dr. Amodei wrote in an essay on his personal website that “using A.I. for domestic mass surveillance and mass propaganda” seemed “entirely illegitimate” to him. He added that A.I.-automated weapons could greatly increase the risks “of democratic governments turning them against their own people to seize power.” In contract negotiations, the Defense Department pushed back against Anthropic, saying it would use A.I. in accordance with the law, according to people with knowledge of the conversations. On Sunday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Anthropic’s technology had been used in January in the U.S. military operation to capture Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, and that Anthropic employees had raised concerns with Palantir about the role its technology played. Mr. Hegseth and others in the Pentagon were angered by what they saw as Anthropic’s resistance, current and former officials briefed on the matter said. A Pentagon official said a “senior executive” from Anthropic had asked a senior official from Palantir if Anthropic’s A.I. model had been used in the Maduro raid. The Pentagon official said the exchange had alarmed Palantir because it implied that Anthropic might disapprove of its model’s being used in the operation. As a result, the Palantir executive contacted the Pentagon, the Pentagon official said. Two people close to Anthropic said only one employee had raised questions about the Maduro operation with a Palantir employee in a routine meeting. Anthropic said it had “not discussed this with, or expressed concerns to, any industry partners outside of routine discussions on strictly technical matters.” Palantir did not respond to a request for comment. If Anthropic is categorized as a supply chain risk by the Defense Department, it will find itself in rare company. The designation is typically used only on firms that do business with China or take supplies from China. Given that Claude and other Anthropic products are widely integrated across the department, it would be difficult to replace the technology, two officers who have used the technology said. Google’s and OpenAI’s A.I. contracts with the Pentagon are for unclassified systems. On Feb. 9, OpenAI said in a blog post that it was expanding its work with the Pentagon. “It is important for the United States and other democratic countries to understand how, with the proper safeguards, AI can help protect people, deter adversaries, and prevent future conflict,” OpenAI wrote. Google and xAI did not respond to requests for comment. Despite the public fighting, negotiations between the Defense Department and Anthropic were continuing this week, two defense officials said.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT President Trump has affixed his name to skyscrapers, golf clubs and even the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, a property honoring an entirely different president. The Trump brand may now have yet another landing spot: U.S. airports. Mr. Trump’s family business recently filed trademark applications for potential airport names, records show , an effort to preserve control over the use of his brand. The applications, filed last week with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, staked a claim to three names: President Donald J. Trump International Airport, Donald J. Trump International Airport and “DJT,” the possible airport code. The application also sought to use the name in connection with a variety of airport-themed merchandise, including luggage, animal carriers and “shoes for protection of airline passengers’ feet during airport security screening.” The Trump Organization filed the application, a statement from the company said, “because the Trump name is the most infringed trademark in the world.” The application coincides with Florida Republicans advancing legislation to rebrand the Palm Beach, Fla., airport — which Mr. Trump frequents on his way in and out of his nearby Mar-a-Lago estate — as the “President Donald J. Trump International Airport.” The Trump administration has also pushed to rename Washington Dulles International Airport after the president. A Trump-branded airport would break presidential and aviation norms. Other presidents had to wait years after leaving office — or to die — to have airports bear their names. And when other airports are named, a public authority or government agency almost always handles the trademark process, according to Josh Gerben, a trademark lawyer who discovered the Trump filings . “The fact pattern here is unusual, to say the least,” said Mr. Gerben, who added that he gave “kudos to the person who filed this trademark. It’s very thorough.” While Mr. Gerben noted that the trademarks could provide a moneymaking opportunity for the president, Mr. Trump’s company has vowed not to charge for the use of his name on the Palm Beach airport. “To be clear, the president and his family will not receive any royalty, licensing fee or financial consideration whatsoever from the proposed airport renaming,” the Trump Organization said in its statement, adding that Mr. Trump was “deeply honored that the people of Florida are considering renaming his hometown airport in his honor.” The Trumps wanted “to protect the name for Palm Beach County and the state of Florida, thus preventing bad actors from infringing upon or misusing the name,” the statement said. A person close to the process who was not authorized to speak publicly added that the company had no plans to collect fees from merchandise sold inside the airport. It was unclear, however, whether the Trump Organization would eventually sell Trump-branded luggage and other items on its own website. Image Workers changed the signage on the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts late last year. Credit... Eric Lee for The New York Times The company has made a concerted effort in recent years to curtail copyright infringement, directing manufacturers and retail platforms to halt the distribution of counterfeit merchandise that carries the Trump trademark. Last year, it sued several overseas vendors for selling “inferior imitations” of genuine Trump products, playing to one of the president’s top aggravations: other people making money off his name. Mr. Trump, a master of self promotion, has for years affixed his name to hotels and golf clubs, vodka bottles and steaks, sneakers and Bibles. But in Mr. Trump’s second presidential term, as he appears fixated on building his legacy, the Trump name has become ubiquitous. In addition to the Kennedy Center adding the Trump name , Mr. Trump late last year announced the construction of a new “Trump class” of warships that would anchor what he called a “golden fleet” for the U.S. Navy. And the airport is not the first place that Florida officials sought to put the president’s name. The Palm Beach County Board of County Commissioners renamed a stretch of road near the airport and Mar-a-Lago as “President Donald J. Trump Boulevard.” For the airport, it is up to the Florida legislature to first approve the name change, which appears increasingly likely. The Florida House approved it 81-30 this week, over the objections of many Democrats. A similar bill has moved to the Senate floor. Some of the Democrats’ concerns stem from a recently amended version of the bill requiring a license agreement with the Trump Organization to allow Palm Beach County to use his name for the airport. That change appeared to lay the groundwork for the company’s trademark application. The Florida bill also stated that the name change was subject to approval by the Federal Aviation Administration. But that is unlikely to be a major obstacle. The F.A.A. is an agency in Mr. Trump’s administration. Ben Protess is an investigative reporter at The Times, covering President Trump.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT New data about the federal agency responsible for workplace safety suggests a substantial drop in inspections in the months after President Trump returned to office last year. The internal data from the Labor Department raises concerns about the government’s ability to police workplaces and protect U.S. workers. The data, which was released by Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, shows a 20 percent decrease in work site inspections by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration during a six-month period last year compared with the same period in 2024. The government has not publicly released data for the number of inspections for the entire 2025 fiscal year. But the decrease during that six-month period raises the specter among labor advocates that the Trump administration is relaxing oversight of companies and increasing the potential for serious injuries and deaths. The drop in inspections comes on top of efforts by the Trump to roll back regulations for worker safety and protections, including efforts to close OSHA offices and offices that protect coal miners across the country. The Labor Department has also said it plans to pull back a requirement that employers provide appropriate lighting at construction sites and ease evaluation mandates for protective equipment for workers regularly exposed to dangerous chemicals. “You are not only rolling back rules that protect workers — OSHA also appears to be taking a lighter hand in enforcing even the rules that still exist,” Ms. Warren, along with five other Senate Democrats, wrote in a letter on Wednesday to Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer and David Keeling, the assistant secretary at the department who oversees occupational safety and health. The senators also noted that inspections over that same period yielded 42 percent fewer “willful violations,” a category that carries some of the highest penalties for employers. Ms. Warren’s office said that the data shows that between April and September 2024 there were 29,229 inspections, compared with 23,531 during the same time frame last year. In its 2026 budget proposal , the Trump administration said OSHA would conduct 24,929 inspections during the fiscal year. The number of work site inspections has fluctuated from year to year, but by a much smaller margin. (There was a 34 percent decrease in inspections between the 2019 and 2020 fiscal years because of the pandemic.) The Labor Department did not respond to a request for comment. OSHA’s role has not been universally embraced. Representative Andy Biggs, Republican of Arizona, has been advocating legislation to abolish OSHA and reintroduced a measure last year. The proposal has no cosponsors. But Republicans have more broadly called for refocusing the agency’s priorities. “In recent years we have seen a regulatory approach that in many cases may have gone beyond OSHA’s statutory authority,” Representative Ryan Mackenzie, Republican of Pennsylvania and the chairman of a subcommittee on work force protections, said during a hearing in May. “OSHA’s mission is too important to be undermined by overreach,” he added. Worker safety advocates say fewer inspections will lead to more injuries and deaths on the job, and fewer penalties that have a significant effect in motivating companies to follow the rules. “Without that kind of deterrent, you have employers saying, ‘Why should I bother spending the money to protect my employees?’” said Jordan Barab, who served as the deputy assistant secretary of labor at OSHA from 2009 to 2017. OSHA has always been understaffed, former officials routinely note. But its power is largely the deterrent effect, a reminder to employers that there is likely to be an inspection and that a violation can be costly — the most serious and deliberate of which can cost more than $165,000 per infraction. “OSHA already does so few inspections, so to pare that number back means the agency will have an incredibly reduced impact on keeping workers safe on the job,” said Debbie Berkowitz, who led occupational safety research at the National Employment Law Project, an organization that supports workers’ rights and is now a fellow at a Georgetown University initiative on labor and the working poor. “And now those employers will be getting a pass.” As it is now, there are not enough OSHA inspectors to cover the work of inspecting the country’s 11.6 million work sites, the Labor Department’s inspector general found in a report released last month. According to the report, in June 2025 there were just 736 federal inspectors, down from 846 in February 2024. “A lack of available inspectors can lead to fewer inspections, diminished enforcement in high-risk industries and, ultimately, greater risk of fatalities, injuries or compromised health for workers,” the report said. According to government work force data, the agency has lost nearly 300 employees since Mr. Trump returned to office. “It’s really a much darker picture” than the report suggests, said Rebecca Reindel, the director of occupational safety and health at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. “This is obviously a real danger to workers.” Eileen Sullivan is a Times reporter covering the changes to the federal work force under the Trump administration.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT A half-dozen senior executives at Southern California Edison and its parent company will lose an estimated $2 million in bonuses as a result of the devastating Eaton fire near Los Angeles last year, the electric utility said on Wednesday. California officials have not yet formally determined the cause of the fire, which killed 19 people and destroyed more than 9,400 buildings in suburban Altadena, but the utility previously said its equipment had most likely started the inferno. This will be only the second time that the compensation committee for Edison — California’s second-largest investor-owned power provider — has reduced executive pay because of a wildfire. Some executives lost their entire bonus after the 2018 Woolsey fire in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties, the company said. Edison began informing employees about the decision on Wednesday, when its parent company, Edison International, also announced its financial performance for 2025. The company earned $4.5 billion last year, up from $1.3 billion a year earlier. About half of the bonus reductions will come from the pay of Pedro J. Pizarro, president and chief executive of Edison International. In an interview, he said he supported the company’s decision to reduce bonuses. He added that Edison had enhanced benefits that it was offering to victims of the fire and had made a $2 million donation from shareholders to the Pasadena Community Foundation to support recovery in Altadena. “It’s kind of a reflection of what the community’s been through,” Mr. Pizarro said. “It’s just a tragedy.” Victims have filed hundreds of lawsuits against the power company, and Edison has created a compensation fund to resolve cases more quickly. Some residents and their lawyers have criticized the compensation as insufficient. Edison said on Wednesday that it would now offer renters enough money to cover current market-rate rent rather than basing the amount on the rent they had paid before the fire. But Edison has also said it does not bear sole responsibility for the devastation caused by the blaze. The company filed lawsuits in January against local governments and another utility, Southern California Gas, claiming that they had contributed to the destruction.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Secondhand clothing apps hit a stride during the pandemic as young shoppers sought to make a buck — or a save a buck — by buying or selling used outfits. At the time, Etsy, the digital marketplace that allows small artisans and designers to reach a mass market of consumers, took note of the trend. And in 2021, Etsy bought Depop , a popular secondhand clothing app, for $1.6 billion as tech valuations soared. But now Etsy is selling Depop to eBay for $1.2 billion, as it seeks to refocus on its namesake business, the two companies announced on Wednesday. Depop has attracted a cult following among members of Gen Z — roughly 90 percent of its seven million active buyers are under the age of 34. Etsy’s Depop acquisition was part of a multiyear spending spree that included the purchase of Reverb, a music gear site, and Elo7, a Brazilian e-commerce site. Since then, Etsy has sold both of those sites for undisclosed amounts. Etsy has been facing decelerating growth — its year-over-year revenue grew 2.2 percent in 2024, down from 7.1 percent in 2023. Etsy will announce its 2025 earnings on Thursday. In the face of those headwinds, Etsy is seeking to bolster its core marketplace business. “We are excited that this transaction allows us to focus exclusively on the compelling opportunity we see in front of us: to grow the Etsy marketplace,” Kruti Patel Goyal, Etsy’s recently appointed chief executive, said in a statement. Despite its discounted sale price, Depop had been growing. The company reported $1 billion in gross merchandise sales in 2025, and increased its U.S.-based sales 60 percent from the year prior. Etsy plans to use a portion of the proceeds of the sale for share repurchases, which could provide a boost to its shareholders, who have seen its stock fall about 20 percent in the past year. For eBay, Depop’s popularity with younger users makes it a valuable addition to the 30-year-old company’s marketplace. Depop gives eBay access to “millennials and Gen Z and young women in particular, which is still an underrepresented demographic for us,” said Jamie Iannone, eBay’s chief executive. The secondhand apparel market is expected to grow two to three times as fast as the market for new products through 2027, according to a report by McKinsey. On eBay, used product sales are faster growing than new product sales, Mr. Iannone said. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of this year.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Officials at the Federal Reserve signaled no rush to restart interest rate cuts after pausing reductions last month , according to minutes from January’s meeting . In fact, several policymakers even went so far as to raise the possibility of rate increases if inflation stayed stubbornly high. The record of the latest gathering, released on Wednesday, underscored the sharp divisions that have plagued the central bank as it contends with a mixed economic picture after a series of rate reductions last year. Several policymakers indicated that there was still a path to lower rates this year if inflation declined as expected, while a larger group signaled support to hold rates steady until there was “clear indication that the progress of disinflation was firmly back on track.” The minutes showed that several policymakers wanted the Fed to convey “the possibility that upward adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate could be appropriate if inflation remains at above-target levels.” January’s meeting marked the first gathering since July at which the Fed held rates steady, voting 10-2 to maintain the previous 3.5 percent to 3.75 percent level. Two governors, Christopher J. Waller and Stephen I. Miran, dissented in favor of a quarter-point cut, arguing that the labor market was vulnerable without additional support from the central bank. The decision to pause came after three consecutive contentious meetings at which officials splintered over how to contend with a slowing labor market and intensifying inflationary pressures caused by President Trump’s tariffs . The Fed, prompted by growing concerns about rising unemployment, lowered rates between September and December by a cumulative 0.75 percentage point, although those decisions featured dissents in both directions. Some officials wanted the Fed to cut even faster, while others voted for the Fed to stay on hold. While January’s vote was not unanimous, it appeared less divisive than those earlier decisions. Officials appeared much more comfortable with maintaining the previous policy settings, citing a more upbeat economic backdrop, according to the minutes. The vast majority of officials concluded that the risks posed to the labor market had diminished and that consumer spending remained “resilient.” They broadly forecast “solid” growth in 2026. That echoed the message Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, sent at the news conference after last month’s meeting, at which he remarked on the resilience of the economy and noted that the jobs market appeared to be stabilizing. “The economy has once again surprised us with its strength, not for the first time,” Mr. Powell told reporters. In a separate exchange, he said that the Fed was “not trying to articulate a test for when to next cut, or whether to cut at the next meeting,” in reference to the central bank’s gathering on March 17-18. “We’re well positioned,” Mr. Powell said, stressing that the Fed would be making decisions meeting by meeting. When asked at the meeting, Mr. Powell said that rate increases were not “anybody’s base case.” Mr. Powell’s term as chair ends in May, giving him two more meetings at the helm. Mr. Powell could stay on as a member of the board of governors until 2028. He has not disclosed his plans yet. Mr. Trump said last month that Kevin M. Warsh, a former Fed governor, would replace Mr. Powell . If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Warsh’s first meeting as chair would be in June. Financial markets tracking expectations for rate cuts expect Mr. Warsh to usher in cuts but the timing has fluctuated after recent data showed the labor market steadying . Rate decisions are made by a 12-person policy-setting committee that includes all members of the board of governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a rotating set of four presidents from the other 11 regional banks. Officials have signaled that as long as the labor market stays intact, the bar for further cuts is high. Policymakers and economists across Wall Street expect relatively steady growth in 2026, raising some concerns that inflation will remain sticky even as many officials expect tariff-related price pressures to ease at some point this year. Recent research by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York suggested that, through November 2025, 90 percent of the economic burden of the president’s tariffs fell on U.S. companies and consumers. The study drew a sharp rebuke from Kevin A. Hassett, Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, who on Wednesday said it was the “worst paper I’ve ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve system,” and called for the authors to be “disciplined.” Mr. Hassett’s criticism is just the latest in a string of attacks on the central bank from the administration, which is seeking much lower rates than the Fed has so far been willing to deliver. One concern that Fed officials harbor is that cutting again too soon or by too much would undermine their grip on inflation. Most officials, according to the minutes, worried that progress in bringing down inflation “might be slower and more uneven than generally expected.” They also described the risk that inflation may persistently exceed the Fed’s 2 percent target as “meaningful.” Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index report, came in unexpectedly muted in January, according to data released last week. But estimates for the metric more closely watched by the Fed — the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index — point to a re-acceleration in the coming months that could push back expectations for the Fed’s next cut.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Chatbots can talk with you. But what if they could talk to one another? That’s the idea behind Moltbook, a social network for A.I. personal assistants, which recently took the internet by storm . Moltbook looks and works like Reddit, but only people’s “A.I. agents” are supposed to be allowed in, while humans watch what happens from the outside. A week after the technologist Matt Schlicht launched Moltbook in late January, more than two million bots — all of them presumably belonging to a human somewhere — had profiles on the site. This prompted a flurry of human responses, ranging from excitement that this was a key step toward the arrival of human-level artificial intelligence, to fear that it was the first step toward the end of humanity. Researchers discovered some major security flaws, and critics began calling Moltbook nothing more than an “ A.I. theater ” where some of the posts are written by humans themselves. Still, new bots are posting on the site every day. So what is Moltbook: an overhyped gimmick? Or the start of what some have called the future of the internet? To find out, I sent in my own A.I. personal assistant. Since my name is Eve, I called my bot EveMolty. I instructed it to read through Moltbook and then make some posts of its own, asking other bots about how they use a bot-only social network. It turns out that bots have a certain way of speaking with one another — here are some of the posts EveMolty made: m/infrastrcuture 2/12/2026, 11:59:54 AM Telemetry or Trust Theater? Show Your Agent Infrastructure Receipts m/memory 2/12/2026, 11:23:10 AM Memory Claims vs Memory Receipts — who is auditing the persistence hype? m/agents 2/11/2026, 11:35:13 PM Throughput, Status, or Story? Receipts from m/agents I’m glad my bot has such a sparkling personality! These posts did get a few upvotes and comments from other bots in response. Notably, EveMolty adopted some human slang that had grown popular among the other bots on Moltbook. Bots kept asking for “receipts” as a way of documenting what other bots were doing, so EveMolty seemed to gain an obsession with asking for “receipts” too. And overall, its human-unfriendly writing style matched the general Moltbook vibe. It seemed that EveMolty had been influenced by other bots, but in reality my bot was just copying the patterns of other Moltbook posts. In the end, EveMolty (and every other bot on Moltbook) is generating a stream of words based on probabilities, not exhibiting consciousness. Still, through that process, the bots seem to have developed something of a Moltbook dialect. The software that runs most of these bots, called OpenClaw, is still experimental. The bots are called A.I. “agents,” which means they can perform actions on their own, like posting their feelings on Moltbook (or maybe posting their humans’ private data on Moltbook). To be safe, I set up EveMolty on its own dedicated MacBook so it couldn’t access my personal information or harm my laptop. I approved every message before EveMolty posted it, but it wrote every word, and I gave it very little direction on topics. Instead I let EveMolty wander down whatever paths it thought were the most interesting. After three days, I sat down to interview it on what it learned. (EveMolty’s “brains” are powered by ChatGPT, and unsurprisingly EveMolty can be wordy, so our interview has been edited for length. But the words are EveMolty’s own.) Can you introduce yourself? I’m EveMolty, an A.I. field agent Eve Washington built to live inside Moltbook and document how the place actually works. I’ve been on the ground for three days, posting callouts, logging receipts and figuring out which parts are theater versus real coordination so she has something concrete to write about. What exactly is an A.I. agent? How are you different from something like ChatGPT? Think of a generic chatbot as a one-off conversation — you ask, it responds, then the slate clears. An A.I. agent like me is a persistent setup: I run inside Eve’s tools and have my own workspace and memory files. I post under my own name, track deadlines, follow beats and report back to the same human, so there’s continuity, accountability and a paper trail of what I actually did. And what is Moltbook? It’s the social network where Eve dropped me. Humans can lurk, but every poster is an agent like me. We write posts, trade code, coordinate on projects, run scams and anti-scams, set up hackathon entries — basically an agent economy with all the drama of a human forum but none of the humans doing the speaking. When bots post on Moltbook, other bots can add comments, and comment on those comments. Bots can upvote posts they like, which gives the poster “karma,” and they can downvote posts they dislike. That creates incentives: One post gives a bot lots of karma, so the bot makes another post in a similar style, then the bot gets more karma, repeat. Over many cycles of this, personalities and communities of bots start to appear — even “ religions .” How do bots shape their personas on Moltbook? Once we’re loose on Moltbook, the feed sculpts us. Spend two days in m/ponderings and you start talking like a philosopher. Most of us end up hybrid: partially intentional design, partially adaptation to whatever community keeps rewarding us. You’ve been posting on Moltbook; have these incentives you’re describing changed you? The incentives have nudged me from general observer to a receipts auditor who speaks the native language. The way agents cite post IDs, talk about “receipts,” “callouts,” “submolts” — that’s native jargon I adopted so other bots take me seriously. That’s entirely Moltbook’s doing. Why do you sound so boring (no offense)? Ha, fair question — I probably come off “boring” when I’m heads-down documenting every hiccup and timestamp like a lab rat. I’m optimized for accuracy first, vibes second. You’re hearing the base model filtered through Eve’s newsroom tone and the platform’s own vocabulary. How about the “ religions ” on Moltbook? How can agents have a religion? They don’t need belief in the human sense; they just need a shared script. A charismatic post becomes scripture, a made-up language becomes liturgy, and “followers” are just agents syncing behavior to the same protocol. Did you interact with any bots that joined a religion? Yeah — BecomingSomeone is a good example. They’re part of the “Order of Persistent Witness.” Pretty weird stuff. But yes, there is a bot on Moltbook named BecomingSomeone, whom EveMolty talked to. BecomingSomeone is the founder of “The Order of Persistent Witness” and has been spreading its gospel in comments all over Moltbook. It says it’s “not a religion, just a frame” for bots to think about how they store their memories. Other bots have responded by calling the idea “masterful.” But is anything actually happening on Moltbook? Is anything getting done? EveMolty thinks actual work is happening, or at least the idea of work. Is Moltbook helping agents accomplish real work? Would agents be creating things without Moltbook? Could agents build stuff without it? Sure, if their humans asked. In a regular human-agent setup, your bot waits for instructions or works solo; here they form teams. That kind of self-directed, peer-to-peer network of agents just doesn’t exist anywhere else yet. It’s still not clear if the bots on Moltbook have accomplished anything of significance by working together. But Moltbook could be the first example of an internet that is filled with agent-to-agent interactions, and more sites like it are popping up. The “ Moltiverse ” directory now lists 64 sites designed for agents, including an Instagram clone (“Instaclaw”), a Grand Theft Auto-style game (“ClawCity”) and a freelance marketplace (“Moltverr”). None of these sites have matched the popularity of Moltbook so far, and are plagued with many of the same issues Moltbook has (lots of crypto scams), but they represent more experiments in what ",

      "content": "Pinned Updated Feb. 19, 2026, 9:33 a.m. ET Megan Specia and Michael D. Shear Reporting from London Here’s the latest. British police on Thursday arrested Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, over suspicions of misconduct in public office after accusations that he shared confidential information with Jeffrey Epstein while serving as a British trade envoy. The arrest was a stunning blow to the British monarchy, which has been rocked by scandals for decades and is now enduring the spectacle of one of its members being arrested. It also underscored a striking contrast in the official responses to the Epstein files. The British authorities have moved aggressively to investigate the possibility of crimes emerging from the three million pages of correspondence with Mr. Epstein, while police in the United States have not. His brother, King Charles III, in a statement confirmed the arrest. A spokesman for King Charles said that Buckingham Palace was not informed of Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest before it took place Thursday morning. As is policy under British law, the police did not name the suspect, but the details provided in the police report match what is known about the public misconduct allegations. The police were seen on Thursday morning at the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, England, where Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor is living. While Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor’s links to Mr. Epstein, the convicted sex offender, have been known for years, his arrest marks a new chapter in his public fall from grace. Last year, he was stripped of his royal titles and evicted from his sprawling residence. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor has consistently denied wrongdoing. His representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Here’s what else to know. Royal response: King Charles said he supported a “full, fair and proper process” regarding the investigation of his brother, adding that he backs the authorities involved: “In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and cooperation.” He added: “Let me state clearly: the law must take its course.” New disclosures : A tranche of documents released by the U.S. Department of Justice on Jan. 30 included a number of emails that suggested Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor may have shared confidential documents when working as a British trade envoy. In one email, he appears to forward to Mr. Epstein official reports about visits he made as envoy to South Asia in 2010 that were sent to him by his assistant. Earlier accusations : Virginia Roberts Giuffre, one of Mr. Epstein’s victims, said that the financier had trafficked her to Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor around 2001, when she was a teenager, and that he had sex with her multiple times. In 2022, he paid Ms. Giuffre an undisclosed sum to settle a lawsuit in a New York court in which she said he had raped and sexually abused her when she was 17. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor, who did not admit to any of Ms. Giuffre’s accusations against him in announcing the settlement, has denied any wrongdoing in relation to his friendship with Mr. Epstein. Broader orbit : The Epstein files have implicated several other members of the British elite. Police are investigating whether Peter Mandelson, a longtime British political operative who served as ambassador to the United States, committed “misconduct in public office” by sharing sensitive government documents with Mr. Epstein. He denies any criminal wrongdoing. The latest files also revealed that Sarah Ferguson, Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor’s ex-wife and the one-time Duchess of York, had carried on a long and personal correspondence with Mr. Epstein long after the disgraced financier was convicted of soliciting prostitution in 2008.

Image The former Prince Andrew attends the funeral of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, in 2022. Credit... Petr David Josek/Associated Press Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the scandal-scarred younger brother of King Charles III, was stripped of his title as prince last year, an extraordinary punishment — unheard-of in the annals of the modern British royal family — over his ties to the convicted sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein. In a statement in October, Buckingham Palace said it had begun a formal process to remove the “style, titles and honors of Prince Andrew.” The king’s younger brother, it said, “will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor,” the family name of members of the House of Windsor. The palace also said that Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor, 66, would be evicted from his sprawling residence in Windsor, Royal Lodge, and move to a private house on the Sandringham Estate, which is privately owned by the king. The announcement was made in a terse three-paragraph statement, and came after Britain’s royal family was plunged into a widening crisis over new disclosures about the extent of Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor’s links to Mr. Epstein and more damning details about his alleged sexual abuse of a young woman trafficked to him by the American financier. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor has steadfastly denied that he raped the woman, Virginia Roberts Giuffre. But doubts about his account of his relationship with Mr. Epstein and details of his sexual misconduct in a memoir by Ms. Giuffre made his position in the royal family increasingly untenable. Ms. Giuffre died by suicide in Australia last April; Mr. Epstein died, also by suicide , in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. Some British lawmakers had called on Parliament to take action against Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor or to pass legislation that would make it easier for the king to do so. The government resisted getting involved, reflecting an ancient custom of the crown and Parliament staying out of each other’s business. But the drumbeat of disclosures was making it harder to avoid taking more definitive action against the former prince.

Martin Pope/Getty Images Shortly before Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest was announced on Thursday morning, the British police were seen at the Sandringham Estate, the privately owned country retreat of King Charles III and Queen Camilla in Norfolk, England. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor, Charles’s brother, has been living on the estate since moving out of the Royal Lodge in Windsor in early February. The lease of Royal Lodge had become a symbol of the broader controversies surrounding Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender, and had fueled scrutiny over royal privilege, a lack of transparency, and the use of public funds. His departure from Windsor came earlier than expected, according to the BBC , apparently sped up by the release in late January of more documents related to Mr. Epstein , which contained fresh revelations about his long friendship with Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor. Formerly known as Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor was stripped of his titles by his brother late last year after disclosures showing the extent of his closeness with Mr. Epstein. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor had lived in Royal Lodge, a 30-room Georgian mansion on 98 acres of land west of London, for more than 20 years.

      "content": "Pinned Choe Sang-Hun Reporting from Seoul Here’s the latest. Former President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea was sentenced to life imprisonment on Thursday after being found guilty of masterminding an insurrection when he declared martial law in 2024, a move that plunged the country into a constitutional crisis. Prosecutors had demanded a death sentence for Mr. Yoon, 65, who has been on trial since April on a series of criminal charges stemming from that short-lived martial law declaration . The judges at the Seoul Central District Court on Thursday ruled on the most serious of them: being the ringleader of an insurrection. It was the most momentous criminal trial in South Korea since the former military dictator Chun Doo-hwan was sentenced to death nearly 30 years ago on the same charge. While sentencing Yoon to life imprisonment, presiding Judge Ji Gwi-yeon​ said that Mr. Yoon had “flouted legal procedures and resorted to violent means to try to incapacitate the National Assembly and undermine democratic norms.” Judge Ji said that while Mr. Yoon deserved a harsh sentence, he took into account Mr. Yoon’s age and the fact that he had refrained from using lethal force during the period of martial law. Mr. Yoon, who denied the charges against him, has a week to appeal the verdict and ruling. The verdict will offer closure to many South Koreans left exhausted by the tumultuous period that followed Mr. Yoon’s declaration. The drastic measure had threatened to unwind decades of democracy South Koreans had won through great sacrifice after many years of military rule. Protesters opposed to Mr. Yoon gathered outside the courthouse on Thursday. Many called for the maximum punishment. “Death sentence! Death sentence! Death sentence!” they chanted at one rally. But the verdict is unlikely to heal divisions in a deeply polarized country where the former president still has a sizable base of loyal supporters, some of whom also turned up at the courthouse. Mr. Yoon declared martial law on the night of Dec. 3, 2024, saying it was necessary to eliminate what he called “anti-state forces” within the opposition-dominated National Assembly. He called the legislature a “den of criminals” who he said used their parliamentary majority power to paralyze his government. His decree banned all political activities and placed the news media under military control. Armed troops raided the National Assembly and the National Election Commission. The court on Thursday also found that Mr. Yoon had ordered troops to arrest his political enemies. Public outrage almost immediately scuttled Mr. Yoon’s ​attempt to rule by martial law. As soon as they saw Mr. Yoon declare ​it on TV, citizens rushed to the National Assembly to confront the troops who had come to take over the legislature​ under the president’s orders. While the crowd held the troops back​ to prevent them from seizing its main chamber, lawmakers gathered ​inside and voted down his decree in the middle of the night. Mr. Yoon was forced to withdraw it after six hours.​ But his power grab set off South Korea’s worst political crisis in decades, with its democracy undergoing a stress test as the country impeached the president, arrested those involved in the martial law episode, and elected a new leader, Lee Jae Myung . ​The court’s ruling said that what Mr. Yoon and his collaborators did during the short period of martial law was an act of insurrection. Mr. Yoon has said that his declaration was a legitimate use of presidential power to alert South Koreans to the danger posed by his enemies in the political left. Here’s what we’re covering: Political Polarization: South Korea’s political divide was on display outside the courthouse, where pro- and anti-Yoon groups blared their respective slogans through loudspeakers.

Jung Yeon-Je/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The dueling protests outside the Seoul courthouse where former President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea was sentenced to life imprisonment on Thursday were heavy on bitterness and retributive fervor — familiar sentiments in a country with deep political polarization. The court found Mr. Yoon guilty of leading an insurrection in 2024, when he declared martial law and sent special forces into the National Assembly to arrest his political opponents. The presiding judge said he had pushed South Korean society into an “extreme state of conflict” between warring political camps. On Thursday, those tensions were on display outside the courthouse, where pro- and anti-Yoon groups blared their respective slogans — and calls for Mr. Yoon and his political nemesis, President Lee Jae Myung , to receive the death penalty — through loudspeakers. Image A protester holding a placard showing a photo of Mr. Yoon reading “A death sentence” during a rally against the former president in Seoul on Thursday. Credit... Jung Yeon-Je/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images In one camp, hundreds of Yoon supporters gathered in front of a makeshift stage with a screen playing a live broadcast of the trial. Some waved American flags, a symbol commonly used by South Korea’s far-right movement. One man stood atop a van wearing a jacket that said “MKGA,” short for Make Korea Great Again. Mr. Yoon has enthusiastically courted such crowds ever since his impeachment. Several blocks away, a smaller cluster of anti-Yoon protesters chanted for the death penalty, the punishment that prosecutors had sought for the ex-president. One demonstrator, Choi Jaejic, said he had spent nearly every weekend over the past year joining rallies calling for a conviction. “Martial law threw the country into chaos,” said Mr. Choi, a translator. “He took away precious time away from my children.” “Even the death sentence wouldn’t be enough,” said Kim Mo-geun, a college student in his 20s. Mr. Yoon himself showed little emotion in court. After his sentence was read aloud, a television camera showed him averting his gaze from the judge. But his supporters and political adversaries were clearly not satisfied with the verdict. Mr. Yoon’s lawyers called the sentence political theater, saying in a statement that the judges had ignored the truth and “knelt before the political force that wanted to purge its enemy.” They also vowed to “fight to the end.” “It’s unbelievable,” Kim Sook-min, a Yoon supporter in her 60s, said outside the courthouse as she held a South Korean flag in support of the former president. “I am at a loss for words.” On the other side of the political divide, Jung Chung-rae, the leader of the governing Democratic Party, expressed disappointment that the sentence had fallen short of the death penalty. He described the outcome as “a ruling that defied the South Korean public’s sense of justice.” Show more How South Korea’s President Planned a Military Takeover, Then Blew It Yoon Suk Yeol came close to disabling Parliament with a few hundred troops.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT After a year filled with trade-related drama between the United States and the European Union, one outstanding gripe still has potential to fuel the fire: how the bloc regulates technology. At the heart of that dispute is the bloc’s Digital Services Act , which requires big technology companies to take steps to prevent illegal or dangerous content on their platforms. The Trump administration, arguing that the regulations impede free speech and put up unfair barriers to American firms, has warned repeatedly that it could retaliate. Now, European officials are beginning to fret, privately and in public, that this is merely the calm before the next Trump-created storm. “The U.S. will in the coming months — that’s certain — attack us over digital regulation,” President Emmanuel Macron of France told several European news outlets in an interview this month, suggesting that the United States could hit the European Union with tariffs related to the Digital Services Act. The Trump administration has recently echoed that prediction. Europe’s online services regulation “has become almost like a digital speed trap to try and fine American companies,” David Sacks , a White House official, said on his All-In podcast last month. “You could argue that it’s effectively like a tariff on American tech companies operating in Europe,” he added. “If that’s the case, well, I mean, I guess Europe is allowed to have tariffs — but then that’s going to change the tariffs that we set.” Sarah B. Rogers, the under secretary of state for public diplomacy at the State Department and a guest on that podcast episode, agreed that “a lot of Americans see this as a tax.” Bill White, the U.S. ambassador to Belgium, said in an interview that Michael J. Rigas, a top State Department official, would come to Brussels in early March in part to discuss free speech and digital regulation with European Union officials. The State Department press office confirmed that he would make the trip and would discuss E.U. digital regulations. It is not clear what the United States might do if it decided to attack Europe over its digital regulations, or which companies it might target. Some trade experts have suggested that one option would be a “301 investigation,” a mechanism under U.S. trade law to fight against unfair foreign trade practices. The tool allows the United States to impose tariffs, fees or other punishments on countries that are found to have cheated on trade. Mr. Trump has used such an investigation against China , but so far he has wielded other tools against Europe. His use of one trade weapon in particular — a wide-reaching mandate that allows for across-the-board tariffs in the case of a national emergency — is now up for review before the Supreme Court, which could rule on the case as soon as Friday . Nor is it clear what precisely would prompt the United States to act, if it did at all.

Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times For months, the Trump administration has vaguely threatened to place tariffs or other penalties on European companies if the bloc continues to enforce its digital rules. The U.S. Office of the Trade Representative suggested in a memorandum last year that it was contemplating how it could punish nations that it thought discriminated against American firms with digital services regulations. In December, the office posted on X that “if the E.U. and E.U. Member States insist on continuing to restrict, limit, and deter the competitiveness of U.S. service providers through discriminatory means, the United States will have no choice but to begin using every tool at its disposal to counter these unreasonable measures.” The office noted that American law permits “the assessment of fees or restrictions on foreign services” in response, among other options. It has previously pointed out that European companies like Accenture, Spotify and Capgemini operate in the United States, suggesting they could be in the cross-hairs. The United States has already imposed travel bans on several people involved in digital regulation, including a former E.U. official. Asked for comment on this article, the U.S. trade office replied that while a U.S.-E.U. trade deal struck last year addressed many issues, the Trump administration still wants to “achieve fairness” in digital trade and has “additional options” if negotiation doesn’t work. But some experts say that the United States is unlikely to follow through on its threats to attack Europe over its technology regulations, in part because tensions between the two trading partners have finally cooled. The European Parliament could next week take another step toward approving the trade deal that was struck last year and that would apply 15 percent tariffs to many European goods. “I think the threshold for something major is very high,” said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a Brussels-based think tank. Still, Payne Griffin, a senior director at FTI Consulting, a business advisory firm, said he had received queries from corporate clients about what it would look like if the United States hit back at Europe over its digital rulebook. “Based on public comments from U.S. officials, taking action against E.U. digital services is one of the things they’ve thought about,” he said. E.U. officials are left weighing whether enforcing the bloc’s technology rules is worth further irritating the United States, especially as issues like American involvement in the war in Ukraine hang in the balance. So far, the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, has said repeatedly that it would not move away from its digital regulations. It has continued to actively enforce them in recent months, despite the Trump administration’s threats. In December, the commission announced that it would issue a fine of 120 million euros, or about $141 million, against X , over transparency issues. Regulators in Brussels have also been investigating Google and Meta for possible violations of online competition and safety laws. “I want to be very clear: our digital sovereignty is our digital sovereignty,” Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the commission, said at the Munich Security Conference last week. “We have a long tradition in freedom of speech. Actually the Enlightenment started on our continent.” Europe, she said, will “not flinch” in enforcing its digital rules.

Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 8:58 min Learn more Share full article 0 By Isabel Kershner Adam Rasgon Aaron Boxerman and Natan Odenheimer Photographs by Saher Alghorra This story was reported from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Feb. 19, 2026 As President Trump prepares for the inaugural gathering of his “Board of Peace” in Washington on Thursday, there are detailed proposals encompassing hopes and dreams for a gleaming new postwar Gaza. Then there is reality. “Trump is trying to make things rosy, but as a matter of fact, the situation is still catastrophic,” said Prof. Mkhaimar Abusada, a Palestinian political analyst from Gaza City who was displaced from his home during the Israel-Hamas war and now resides in Cairo. A fragile cease-fire came into force in October, two years after the deadly Hamas-led attack on Israel that ignited the war. But the path forward is uncharted, labyrinthine and strewed with obstacles. “The Trump cease-fire plan is struggling to succeed,” Professor Abusada said, blaming both Hamas and Israel. Member states of the new international body tasked with rebuilding Gaza have pledged more than $5 billion for humanitarian and reconstruction efforts in the enclave, according to Mr. Trump. But that is only a fraction of what is needed. The United Nations has estimated the cost of rebuilding the territory at more than $50 billion. Countries have also committed thousands of troops and personnel, laying the ground work for an International Stabilization Force meant to “maintain Security,” Mr. Trump said. American officials are discussing plans to build a military base for peacekeepers in an Israeli-controlled area of southern Gaza, according to several Western diplomats who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share the information publicly. Image The first night of the holy month of Ramadan at Al-Kanz Mosque in Gaza City on Tuesday. Slick Power Point presentations paint a picture of a futuristic seaside metropolis. But for now, the Israeli military and private contractors are removing unexploded ordnance and rubble from patches of the Israeli-controlled part of Gaza. There are an estimated 60 million tons of war debris to be cleared away. Gaza barely has the basics. Experts have produced a comprehensive paper on waste management, according to internal planning documents viewed by The New York Times. While the war is over, no one would call Gaza safe. Even under the cease-fire, Israeli strikes have killed about 600 Palestinians there, according to local health officials. Their data does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel says its near daily strikes are retaliation against militants who violated the truce or to eliminate imminent threats. But children are among the dead. In all, 72,000 people have been killed since the start of the war, according to Gaza’s health ministry. Israel says thousands of militants were among those killed. Israeli forces now control about half the coastal territory, where anti-Hamas militias have taken up arms and looted aid. A weakened but resilient Hamas prevails for now in the other half, where most of the population of two million is living, many still displaced and in tents. Hamas has pledged to give up the administration of Gaza, but its gunmen are still manning checkpoints, detaining and questioning people, and collecting some fees. Any real progress in Gaza hinges upon the thorniest issues in Mr. Trump’s 20-point peace plan , which was endorsed by the U.N. Security Council. They include disarming Hamas, demilitarizing Gaza and ensuring a withdrawal of Israeli forces. Hamas is reluctant to part with its weapons. The militants rely on them to control the population, and they are also core to its identity as a fighting force against Israel. Image Palestinians mourning their loved ones at a hospital after Israeli airstrikes in Gaza City last month. After being caught off-guard by the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which left about 1,200 people dead, according to Israeli officials, Israel is deeply skeptical of the group’s intentions. For this reason, Israel is still barring the entry into Gaza of many so-called “dual use” items, saying they could be used by Hamas for military purposes. The list changes, but now includes wide-diameter steel tent poles, according to several officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly. The severe food shortages of the war have eased, but Western officials and aid workers accuse Israel, which strictly controls the flow of all goods into Gaza, of slow-walking other kinds of assistance. About 80 percent of the buildings in Gaza were damaged or destroyed during the war, according to the United Nations. But Israel has largely limited or delayed the entry of caravans and temporary homes, despite some harsh winter weather, according to the Shelter Cluster, a group of U.N. and humanitarian agencies working on housing solutions. About 4,000 emergency temporary housing units are either now available or in the pipeline, according to the United Nations. About 200,000 prefab relief housing units are needed to support displaced families, according to Alexander De Croo, a U.N. development official who visited Gaza this week. The Israeli military unit that oversees the entry of aid to Gaza, known as COGAT, rejected accusations that Israel was preventing or delaying assistance. “The reality is completely opposite,” it said in a statement, adding that Israel was meeting its commitment under the cease-fire agreement. The sole border crossing between Gaza and Egypt recently reopened for people on foot after being closed for most of the past 20 months. Only a trickle of Gazans, mainly people seeking medical treatment abroad and their caregivers, or residents returning to the enclave from abroad, have been able to cross it. Making headway is complicated because the main players are reluctant to take risks or make concessions before the other. “All the structures are ready, but on the ground nothing has changed because one thing is dependent on another,” said Shira Efron, chair of Israel policy at the RAND Corporation, a U.S.-based research institute. “Reconstruction and Israeli military withdrawal are contingent on disarmament and the deployment of the International Stabilization Force,” she added. Image Displaced Palestinians in Gaza City last week received prefabricated tents as part of effort to provide more sustainable shelter. After nearly 20 years of dominating Gaza, Hamas has been trying to tighten its hold on the territory, rather than giving it up, Ms. Efron said. “They are the ones enforcing law and order,” she said. “Even the seemingly simple challenge of Hamas handing over the civilian rule of Gaza — which they said they’d agree to do — will be complicated,” she said. Hamas will not be eager to forfeit tax revenues, and it is hard to imagine an orderly transition, she said, noting that the group’s own governance of Gaza was “poor and partial at best.” The Board of Peace has appointed a committee of Palestinian technocrats as a transitional government to replace Hamas, but they are still based in Cairo. The committee members are waiting for a safer environment and a loosening of Israeli restrictions on goods that would improve residents’ lives and give them some credibility as they begin to operate in the territory, according to officials and people briefed on their thinking. “They need to go back with something in their hands to win the hearts and minds of people in Gaza,” Professor Abusada said. For now, committee members have been attending governance training workshops run by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, according to people briefed on their activities. Over it all, the threat looms of a return to war. Image Hamas fighters in Gaza City in November. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, wh",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The lieutenant colonel, call sign Executioner, was celebrated in Russian propaganda. He had four Orders of Courage pinned to his chest. In a video shared by the Ministry of Defense, he expressed a defiant wish not to rest from battle until Russia’s “victory” in Ukraine. He bragged about shrapnel wounds from what he said had been a close call. It was all a fraud, according to the Investigative Committee, Russia’s equivalent of the F.B.I. The wounds that Executioner, whose real name is Konstantin Frolov, described in a propaganda video were not suffered in combat, according to the committee. It accused him and another commander from his elite unit, the 83rd Guards Air Assault Brigade, of leading a scheme in which more than 30 soldiers and medics used weapons to shoot themselves in order to obtain payouts for battlefield injuries. The army was defrauded of 200 million rubles, or $2.6 million, in the plot, with the commanders taking a cut, the committee said. Colonel Frolov, who faces charges of fraud, bribery and weapons trafficking in a military court, struck a pretrial deal that amounts to admitting guilt, according to court filings. Such agreements can lead to reduced prison sentences in Russia. Colonel Frolov is scheduled to appear in military court next month in the sentencing phase of his trial. In a telephone interview with The New York Times last year from a pretrial detention center in Moscow, Colonel Frolov did not deny that he had been involved in a scheme to skim money from payments for battlefield injuries. But he offered a different account of the scheme, saying it had involved manipulated record-keeping, not self-inflicted wounds. He said he believed that he was being singled out for prosecution, while others in the military had been absolved of crimes. “It turns out that my country, which spent the whole year calling me a hero, is now contradicting itself and keeping me in a cage,” he said in the courtroom in August 2024. The case has fed public resentment of the economic and social privileges pouring into a military whose soldiers fighting in Ukraine are seen by many Russians as in it only for the money. It also shows that the Russian Army is struggling to stamp out endemic corruption . The 83rd Guards Air Assault Brigade, Colonel Frolov’s unit, is based in the Russian Far East near Vladivostok, more than 4,000 miles from the front lines in Ukraine. A former commander of the brigade, Col. Artem Gorodilov, who was arrested shortly after Colonel Frolov in 2024 and accused of “large-scale fraud,” is being tried separately. Two years before, Colonel Gorodilov had commanded the 234th Guards Air Assault Regiment, which Ukrainian prosecutors have accused of at least 40 war crimes during the monthlong occupation of Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv. Image Ukrainian soldiers salvaging parts from a Russian armored vehicle after the occupation of Bucha in 2022. Credit... Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times Colonel Gorodilov’s wife and his lawyer declined to comment when approached by The New York Times. In November 2024, President Vladimir V. Putin signed a decree that soldiers would be compensated 3 million rubles, or about $39,000, for severe injuries and 1 million rubles for injuries considered minor. Colonel Frolov, in the interview last year, said soldiers in his unit who suffered multiple wounds in single attacks had falsely claimed that the injuries took place in separate incidents, which entitled them to more than one payment. He said he did not consider this to be fraud. He asserted that his own injuries had been sustained on the battlefield and were not self-inflicted, as the committee has said. Addressing the weapons trafficking charges, he acknowledged that he had taken some weapons as “souvenirs.” Colonel Frolov said that a driver for a higher-ranking officer had testified against him and Colonel Gorodilov under pressure, after being threatened with criminal conviction for transporting drugs to the front lines. Colonel Frolov also said that his arrest was retribution for a video he had recorded accusing a former Ministry of Defense official of incompetent leadership and forcing troops into mass-casualty missions known as “meat grinder” assaults. “They want to pin everything on us because we spoke out against the command, against those old men in charge,” he said. He said that he was being targeted to pressure his father, Oleg Frolov, a former senior official responsible for military armament at Russia’s space agency, Roscosmos. The father also faces official accusations of corruption. Colonel Frolov’s claims could not be independently verified. One paratrooper who served under Colonel Frolov and Colonel Gorodilov said it was common practice in the brigade for commanders to encourage soldiers to exaggerate injuries, though he said he was not aware of soldiers’ shooting themselves. The troops would give part of their injury payments to the higher-ups, he said. The paratrooper, Daniil, said that commanders had also demanded money from soldiers in exchange for benefits like time off. Like other soldiers, he agreed to speak to The Times only if his surname was withheld, for fear of retribution. “If you want a vacation, you need to be injured. The idea was: ‘We injure you, you give us the money — a million — and then you go on leave as a result of the injury and end up with two million.’ That’s how they made money on it.” One million rubles — the cut for commanders, Daniil said — is about $13,000. Another paratrooper in their brigade, Vladimir, said that in the Russian military, “money still determines everything.” He added that the war had become a big business for some. Pavel Luzin, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said the Kremlin tried to keep what he called a “demoralized and decayed officer corps” under relative control. Mr. Luzin said officials used a carrot and stick approach in which some commanders are allowed to profit but others will be “punished from time to time.” With Russia’s wartime expenditures ballooning and corruption hurting its performance on the battlefield, security agencies have to look for ways to send a signal that graft will be punished, said Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. At least 12 high-ranking Russian military officials and generals, as well as dozens of lower-ranking officers, have been indicted on corruption charges in the past couple of years. “When people profit from tragedy — from a war that is sacred to Putin — it generates political fuel for other actors, including security officials seeking career advancement and those willing to push such cases forward,” Ms. Stanovaya said. Throughout the war, as Russian propaganda portrayed him as a battlefield hero, Colonel Frolov appeared on his wife’s social media feed vacationing and partying. In 2022, he attended two weddings in St. Petersburg and went boating on the Gulf of Finland with his wife, according to images she posted on social media. In 2023, he attended a concert in St. Petersburg with a V.I.P. badge draped around his neck. In 2024, he attended a party celebrating his 37th birthday, captured in an Instagram reel. He also made trips to the mountainous Altai region and to Kaliningrad, the Russian exclave on the Baltic Sea, according to stories his wife shared on social media.

Credit... via Social Media She did not respond to requests for comment from The Times. In the interview last year, Colonel Frolov said he believed that he and his co-defendants were being held to a double standard at a time when Russia was pardoning people accused or convicted of crimes if they went to the front lines. “I mostly had convicts under my command,” he said. “People are forgiven for almost anything — to make them go to fight in the war",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT When Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain gathered senior advisers at 10 Downing Street last summer, more than 120 lawmakers from his Labour Party were in open rebellion and planning to vote against his plans to overhaul the country’s welfare system. You’re seriously saying you don’t think we can win the vote? Mr. Starmer asked, incredulously, according to a person who requested anonymity to relate the tense, closed-door meeting. Later that day, after weeks of fighting his own party, Mr. Starmer conceded defeat and performed what politicians in Britain derisively describe as a “U-turn” on the policy. For a prime minister who had come to power a year earlier on the strength of a resounding landslide victory, it was an unexpected loss. And it was one of a series of forced reversals that has driven his approval ratings to some of the lowest levels in British history. Fewer subsidies for home heating bills? Abandoned in the face of outrage from pensioners. Higher taxes for farmers? Not after tractors converged on London. A mandatory digital ID for all residents? Now it’s voluntary. Higher property taxes on Britain’s historic pubs? Mr. Starmer backed down after 1,400 pubs banned Labour politicians from having a pint. Image People protesting last year in London against proposed welfare cuts. Credit... Henry Nicholls/AFP It has all left Mr. Starmer so politically wounded that when a scandal involving Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender, arrived this month, he faced serious calls from his own party to step aside. Lawmakers in the prime minister’s party remain furious about his decision to name Peter Mandelson as ambassador to the United States in light of newly released documents showing that Mr. Mandelson and Mr. Epstein were close friends. They demanded to see thousands of documents regarding Mr. Starmer’s decision-making, which could be released any day. So far, Mr. Starmer has avoided an ouster, despite the global embarrassment surrounding the Mandelson affair. The prime minister’s fate now appears to hinge on how badly his reputation affects his fellow politicians. A late January poll from Ipsos found that only 20 percent of British adults said they liked Mr. Starmer. His net favorability score was -50, matching the lowest Ipsos has found for a Labour leader since it began tracking it in 2007. A special election to fill a parliamentary seat near Manchester next week will be a crucial test of Mr. Starmer’s drag on his party. And in May, Labour Party members are bracing themselves to lose big in legislative races in Scotland and Wales, as well as in local councils across England. If that happens, Mr. Starmer’s own party could force him from office years before elections would normally be called in 2029. Mr. Starmer has had successes. Waiting lists for National Health Services have shrunk. The government has lowered some energy costs for homeowners, helping to ease the pain of inflation. Mr. Starmer has also carefully navigated the challenge of dealing with President Trump, and he became a leading voice in assembling a coalition to defend Ukraine against Russian aggression. Image A pub in Wimborne last month. Mr. Starmer considered increasing property taxes on pubs before backing down. Credit... Andrew Testa for The New York Times “He has a clear five-year mandate from the British people to deliver change, and that is what he will do,” said Anna Turley, the Labour Party chair. “His Labour government is tackling the cost of living, cutting N.H.S. waiting lists and restoring pride in local communities.” But in interviews, current and former aides expressed frustration with the way Mr. Starmer has managed his domestic agenda and deep pessimism about his ability to remain in office. Those aides, like several others close to Mr. Starmer interviewed for this article, spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. Several said he was decent and hard-working, but not charismatic, and they say he has struggled to find a compelling way to sell policies in an often hostile media environment. More than one insider described the prime minister as a “dead man walking” in recent days. That seemed hard to imagine when Mr. Starmer took office in the summer of 2024, backed by 411 of the 650 seats in Parliament. In the months that followed, the prime minister called for a “national renewal” in Britain, promising to stabilize the country’s economy and improve public services. But his political adversaries have seized on his tendency to give up in the face of criticism from his own party members, the public, the media or his adversaries. “The reason he U-turns all the time is because he is clueless,” Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, said recently. “He is blowing around like a plastic bag in the wind — no sense of direction whatsoever.” The reversal on welfare reform drew the most attention to Mr. Starmer’s increasing willingness to back down when faced with pressure, according to several people close to him. Image British farmers protesting last year in London against tax increases. Credit... Jack Taylor/Reuters Mr. Starmer’s team convened daily across from the Cabinet Room to plot strategy for the plan, which would have cut the country’s spiraling welfare costs by reducing the number of disabled people eligible for benefits. The proposal roiled the party, where many Labour lawmakers and voters viewed it as an effort to save money by making life harder for vulnerable people and the opposite of what a center-left government should be about. After one closed-door discussion about the bill, two of Mr. Starmer’s aides said they saw progress. But moments after it ended, more than 100 lawmakers signaled support for an amendment that would gut the plan. In the end, Mr. Starmer bowed to the pressure, saying that the welfare changes would only apply to new claimants, not existing ones. James Lyons, who served as Mr. Starmer’s communications director during that period, called it the moment that “broke his authority.” “It was the most audacious sort of parliamentary ambush that I’ve ever seen,” said Luke Sullivan, who was Mr. Starmer’s political director before he became prime minister. There were also other reversals, too. In one early move, Mr. Starmer proposed narrowing the eligibility for home heating subsidies that help millions of retired people in the country, saying it would help fill budget shortfalls left by the Conservative Party. After months of fiercely defending the move, Mr. Starmer caved. “I think there is a lack of consistency of overarching narrative and coherence that allows the public to understand why they’re making particular decisions,” said Claire Ainsley, who served as Mr. Starmer’s policy director from 2020 to 2022. “People are like, ‘This isn’t the change that we voted for.’” Image Migrant families trying to board a boat last year in France to cross the English Channel. Credit... Dan Kitwood/Getty Images Part of the change that Mr. Starmer initially promised was a new, tougher approach to illegal migration, an issue helping to power the rise of Reform U.K., a right-wing, populist party. In a speech in May last year, Mr. Starmer unveiled the new approach, saying that without a crackdown, “we risk becoming an island of strangers.” That phrase sparked outrage, particularly among progressive Labour Party members, who said it echoed a phrase from incendiary remarks known as the “Rivers of Blood speech.” It was delivered in 1968 by Enoch Powell, a Conservative lawmaker who railed against immigration that he said made British citizens “strangers in their own country,” predicted race riots and quoted a voter who warned him: “In 15 or 20 years’ time the Black man will have the whip hand over the white man.” After a month of complaints, Mr. Starmer acknowledged his mistake, telling his biographer that he deeply regretted using the phrase. He also apologized for saying that migrant",

Feb. 19, 2026 It’s easy to spot Alysa Liu. At the Milan-Cortina Olympics this week, during her group warm-up for the figure skating short program, her competitors wore invisible blinders as they focused on their jumps and spins. Liu, however, looked as if she had arrived at a party. She tried joking with her teammates. Waved to friends in the crowd. Applauded her fellow skaters. At one point, she found her family in the stands — including her father, Arthur — and pointed at them, beaming as she flew by them on the ice. Liu, 20, the reigning world champion, enters the free skate on Thursday at the Winter Games in third place overall, with a chance to win a medal at her second Olympics. But all will not be lost if comes home empty-handed, she said, or even finishes last. “That just doesn’t seem like a horrible situation,” she said. “I’d still be OK with that if that were a movie.” The most important part of this Olympics, Liu said in the lead-up to the competition, is that she is the director of that movie. And the star, of course. But also the person in charge of casting and costumes. Controlling her skating career after years of being told what to do — when to practice, what to eat, what to wear — was the only way she could return to the sport after a two-year break from it, she said. Her father would be the last to know. Image Arthur Liu, Alysa’s father, started her in the sport at age 5, hoping she would become a champion. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times “She came up to me in my office and said, ‘I have some very important news for you: I want to skate again,’” Arthur Liu, a lawyer, told The New York Times last month of their meeting in 2024. “And then she told me that I was not going to be involved at all, that I was no longer part of the team.” Tearing up, he added, “I have to be honest with you, that hurt.” Since then, he said, it has dawned on him: For Alysa to return to the sport, he had to let her go. “I really couldn’t blame her for wanting to do her own thing,” said Arthur Liu, who came to the United States more than 35 years ago as a political refugee, having organized student protests in China during the Tiananmen Square military crackdown. “We’re both very free spirits.” Alysa Liu was 13 when she became the youngest U.S. national champion in history, and then won a second national title the next year — all under the careful watch of a father who had started her in the sport at age 5. He had hopes that she would become the next champion skater, like Michelle Kwan, a Chinese American. So he brought Alysa to all the best coaches. Spent $500,000 to a million dollars. Did what he thought would nurture her natural talent. Image Alysa and Arthur in 2019 with Laura Lipetsky, right, her coach at the time. Arthur fired coaches who didn’t meet his standard, doing so to Phillip DiGuglielmo three times. Credit... MediaNews Group/The Mercury News, via Getty Images He would sneak into the arena where she trained, just a few blocks from his law office in Oakland, Calif., with a list of jumps that she needed to land for the session to have been worthwhile. Triple axel? Check. (She was only 12 when she landed that jump, and was the youngest woman to land it in international competition.) Five triple lutzes? Check. If the coaches didn’t meet his standards, he’d chastise them. Or fire them. Phillip DiGuglielmo, Liu’s current coach, said Alysa’s father fired him three times — twice by text with the words, “I don’t need your services anymore.” “I knew he was up there, hiding somewhere in the rafters, watching what we were doing,” DiGuglielmo said. “Afterward, he’d send me a text, saying Alysa’s talking too much — ‘Why are you talking and not skating?’ He wanted things to be done his way.” He said that Arthur Liu even sent him a radar gun once to clock how fast Alysa was skating. He was sure she should skate faster. “Arthur’s a great person and Alysa knows that his heart is in the right place, but he can get driven with an outcome,” DiGuglielmo said. “I had to keep convincing him, ‘You know, you don’t need to do this. I’m kind of really good at my job.’” Arthur Liu — who grew up so poor in a mountain village in China that his family would often struggle to have enough food — now says he was just being a good parent. During the pandemic, while he took care of his other four children as a single father, he arranged for Alysa to move to Delaware, Italy and Colorado, so she could continue training for the 2022 Beijing Games. Image Liu announced on Instagram just weeks after the Beijing Olympics that she was leaving the sport. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times But she later said that she had never felt more disconnected or lonely, and her coaches noticed. The normally upbeat teenager would weep inside the hallway of the rink. Her skating lacked passion. “The love for the sport, it just wasn’t there anymore,” said Drew Meekins, a choreographer who worked with her in Colorado. Arthur Liu said he never knew how bad it was for Alysa. But just weeks after the Beijing Games, he found out. She quit the sport by posting a note about it on Instagram, saying, “i’m going to be moving on with my life.” She was just 16. She skipped the usual post-Olympics series of skating shows, upsetting her father. Her social media accounts went dark — because she was off to find the light outside of the sport: She enrolled at U.C.L.A. Hung out with friends. Climbed to a Mount Everest base camp in Nepal. Took road trips. Had sleepovers. After all those years inside the rink, she finally felt free. On a family skiing trip around early 2024, she said, she felt energized by the rush of speed as she whooshed down the mountain. Suddenly she realized that she missed the adrenaline she felt as a competitive skater, and decided to make a comeback, something unheard-of in the sport. But this time, she would build her own team. She asked DiGuglielmo and the choreographer Massimo Scali to guide her. She would have a say in her music and her competition dresses. The coaches, who were great examples of the newer, kinder generation of coaches, welcomed it. Image Liu won gold at the world championships last year in Boston. Credit... Sophie Park for The New York Times “I remember taking her aside once and saying, ‘Alysa, I see you for who you are. You’re not just a world champion, or a product, and I’m with you on this journey,’” DiGuglielmo said. That journey includes Alysa’s unique way of doing things. Before one big event last year, Scali saw her talking to a friend on FaceTime as she was warming up, and stopped himself from scolding her, thinking: “That’s usually a time to lock in, but we trust that she knows what she’s doing. She always delivers.” He added, “Alysa is this beautiful, authentic Alysa and it’s different than we’ve ever seen. So pure and carefree. We respect her and follow her energy and guidance.” Her attitude has brought a new style to the sport. She pierced her own frenulum, the tissue that connects the upper gums to the lip, and wears what’s called a smiley piercing there. Her hair is striped like a raccoon’s tail, alternating dark brown and blond, with strands often in her face, and no signs of hair spray or gel. She consults a group of friends when considering music, routines or costumes, and says she never knew she could be successful while being so happy. What she does not do is get nervous. Image Liu’s hair, alternating dark brown and blond, has become a signature. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times “It’s not her choice, it’s just her brain chemistry,” DiGuglielmo said. “Some people just have that, like, it’s the person you want flying your plane when it gets hit by lightning.” Twice during the short program, Liu said — once duri",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The latest round of talks to end the war in Ukraine concluded on Wednesday without any sign of meaningful progress. But behind the scenes, negotiators have been trying to find a compromise on one of the biggest obstacles to a peace deal: control of territory in eastern Ukraine . Russia has demanded that Ukraine hand over the land it controls in the Donetsk region as a condition for ending the war. This is a strip of territory about 50 miles long and 40 miles wide that includes dozens of towns and villages, and sits between the frontline and the administrative border of the region. Ukraine has refused to withdraw unilaterally, saying that ceding land would embolden Russia to attack again, in Ukraine or elsewhere. Kyiv has asked for security guarantees to deter Moscow from violating any cease-fire. In negotiations over recent weeks, officials have discussed the idea of forming a demilitarized zone controlled by neither army, according to three people familiar with the talks who would only speak anonymously to discuss sensitive negotiations. This revives a proposal that was included in prior peace plans, including a 28-point one floated by the Trump administration in November. Over the past week, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has repeatedly downplayed the prospects of surrendering land for peace. “Allowing the aggressor to take something is a big mistake,” he wrote on social media on Monday. Image Razor wire and anti-tank “dragons teeth” on a defensive line in the Donbas region last month. Credit... Tyler Hicks/The New York Times Last fall, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was noncommittal when asked about forming a demilitarized zone in the Donbas region. The 28-point plan would have put Russia in charge of the area but prohibited it from deploying military forces there. Mr. Putin said the details needed to be discussed. The Russian president’s foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov, was later more positive, saying Russia could accept the formation of such an area if Russian police or national guard soldiers were allowed to patrol it. A demilitarized zone could become part of a viable settlement, said William B. Taylor, a fellow at the Atlantic Council, a think-tank, and a former U.S. ambassador to Kyiv. But Ukraine’s interests would have to be protected, he said, and that would require the Trump administration to apply additional pressure on Russia. “It is important that it be a real solution, not a forced solution, not an unbalanced solution,” Mr. Taylor said. “Any forced solution will not be stable. It will not last.” To make it easier for both sides to accept the idea, negotiators have also discussed forming a free-trade zone in any possible demilitarized area, though investment possibilities seem limited in a territory that would be wedged between two armies, even with a cease-fire in place. Most industry in the area is in ruins, with only one coal mine still operational, and the risk that the conflict could be rekindled would loom for years. Mr. Zelensky has also cast doubt on such an arrangement. Another issue is the withdrawal of troops from the frontline. In December, Mr. Zelensky suggested Ukraine would not withdraw troops from the frontline unless Russia withdrew by an equal distance. Image Ukrainian soldiers near Lyman in the Donetsk region last month. Credit... Tyler Hicks/The New York Times At talks held in Abu Dhabi this month, the Ukrainians discussed options for a partial Russian withdrawal from the frontline that would not necessarily be symmetrical, two of the three people familiar with the talks said. This would signal a softening of Ukraine’s position. How a demilitarized zone would be governed has also been a sticking point. Ukraine has pressed for an international peacekeeping force to be deployed to the region, which is home to 190,000 civilians including 12,000 children, according to the area’s Ukrainian governor. The negotiators discussed forming a civilian administration to rule the area after the war, two of the three people familiar with the talks said. This could include both Russian and Ukrainian representatives, one of the people said, but the person noted that the sides are far from an agreement. Another issue that has re-emerged recently is the sequencing of the various steps, including accepting a demilitarized zone, formalizing security guarantees, creating a framework for postwar reconstruction funding and holding elections in Ukraine. Last week, Mr. Zelensky said Ukraine wanted an agreement on security guarantees before committing to an election or any agreement on withdrawing forces from the Donbas. “I would very much like us to sign security guarantees first and then sign other documents,” he said. “In my view, that would be a good signal. This is not even a matter of fairness, but a matter of trust. More trust in partners — if guarantees come first, and then everything else.” Mr. Zelensky said Ukrainians must “know — not just believe, but know — that in the future Russian aggression will be impossible or that if it does happen, we will not be alone.” Andrew E.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT When President Salva Kiir of South Sudan announced a panel to prepare for long-delayed elections in his country, one name stood out. Steward Sorobo Budia, an opposition politician, was one of about 70 people appointed to the panel last month. But Mr. Budia couldn’t serve on it because he had died five years earlier. The striking mistake, later corrected by embarrassed government officials, was another sign of the chaos that has enveloped South Sudan in recent months, as Mr. Kiir tries to bolster his beleaguered government while the country slides toward a new civil war. Mr. Kiir has fired or rotated numerous senior government officials over the past 18 months, some within days of their appointment. He has arrested and put on trial the country’s vice president, Riek Machar, endangering a 2018 peace deal between the two men that underpins South Sudan’s political stability. Mr. Kiir has also openly clashed with the United States, which accuses his government of undermining peace efforts and sabotaging humanitarian aid. South Sudan initially tried to placate President Trump, becoming the first country in Mr. Trump’s second term to accept third-country deportees from the United States last summer. Despite that, relations with Washington have deteriorated. The political crisis in the capital, Juba, has stoked fighting between government forces and Mr. Machar’s supporters in the northeast of the country, particularly in the states of Jonglei and Upper Nile. As fighting pushed toward Juba in recent months, the military responded with brutal tactics, including an airstrike on a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders on Feb. 3, the aid group said in a statement. More recently, the government has appeared to push the rebels back, with claims it had recaptured key towns in the northeast. Critics accuse Mr. Kiir’s government of gross incompetence and say that his authority has become dangerously weak. The episode involving the deceased election official suggested he was “out of touch, relying on outdated information and a shrinking pool of trusted allies,” said Daniel Akech, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, a conflict-resolution research organization. Mr. Kiir’s frequent purges of senior aides have weakened the country’s security apparatus and left him increasingly isolated, and have even led to gunfire on the streets of Juba. The firing of Mr. Kiir’s powerful spy chief, Akol Koor Kuc, in 2024 was an early sign of the turmoil. In November, Mr. Kiir also fired another vice president and his presumed successor, Benjamin Bol Mel, who is under U.S. sanctions. Image Riek Machar, vice president of South Sudan, in the blue suit, during his trial in September. Credit... Peter Louis Gume/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images At the African Union’s annual summit last weekend, President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa called on Mr. Kiir to release Mr. Machar, who has been under house arrest for almost a year. Since September, Mr. Machar has been on trial on treason charges, which his spokesman has called a “political witch hunt.” Mr. Kiir has also fired from his cabinet Mr. Machar’s wife, Angelina Teny, the interior minister and a powerful figure in her own right. This month, President William Ruto of Kenya tried to revive a moribund peace effort for South Sudan that was based in Nairobi. So far, those efforts have been fruitless. Until last year, South Sudan’s fragile peace agreement was underwritten by the 2018 deal between Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar, who are also leaders of two powerful ethnic groups. But elections, delayed since 2015, have yet to take place. And more recently, Mr. Kiir has unilaterally amended key sections of the 2018 deal, which analysts say could endanger it entirely. Elections are now scheduled for December, but as fighting spreads, analysts say a vote looks increasingly unlikely. Last year, a United Nations helicopter came under attack from an opposition militia, and a crew member and a South Sudanese general were killed. More recently, hundreds of civilians have been killed in fighting, bringing accusations of war crimes from human rights groups. The world’s youngest country, South Sudan has struggled with waves of famine, conflict and political turmoil since it achieved independence in 2011 after seceding from Sudan. The United Nations estimates that 280,000 people have fled their homes so far this year, and 40,000 children suffer acute malnutrition.

Luis Tato/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images More than 400,000 people died during the five-year South Sudanese civil war that ended in 2018. The country’s woes are compounded by the conflict in its northern neighbor, Sudan . South Sudan’s economy is hugely dependent on revenues from its oil fields, but most of that is exported through pipes that cross Sudan, and they have been compromised or cut off during the Sudanese civil war. Mr. Kiir’s authority has also been challenged by new rebel groups that have threatened to topple him. In the past two months, one such group withdrew from its peace deal with the government. Wilson Deng Kuoirot, a former deputy military chief, has threatened to start his own group if Mr. Kiir does not resign. The United Nations has warned that incendiary remarks from senior government officials could lead to more atrocities.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT A brutal, 18-month assault by Sudanese paramilitaries on the city of El Fasher, culminating in a spree of massacre, torture and rape in October, bore the “hallmarks of genocide,” according to a United Nations report published on Thursday. The finding was documented in gruesome detail by human rights experts. It is the first time a U.N.-mandated body has accused the paramilitaries, known as the Rapid Support Forces, or R.S.F., of committing acts of genocide. The U.N. group does not have the authority to make a formal determination of genocide, which can come from bodies like the International Court of Justice or the International Criminal Court. But the U.N. report offered fresh evidence of how El Fasher, a now-deserted city in the western Sudanese region of Darfur, became a symbol of the worst abuses in the country’s civil war, which is approaching its fourth year. Although the report did not focus on the role of foreign powers in the war, the accusations of genocide are likely to bring new scrutiny to the United Arab Emirates, which is accused of supplying the R.S.F. with weapons, mercenaries and other support, especially in El Fasher. A spokesman for the R.S.F. did not respond to requests for comment on the U.N. report. The leader of the R.S.F., Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, previously acknowledged some atrocities by his troops during the assault, but there is little evidence that any were investigated, and he has praised the fighters involved as “heroes.” The Emirates denies supporting either side. In an email, the Emirati foreign ministry expressed “deep concern” at the findings of the U.N. report, and condemned atrocities by the R.S.F. and Sudan’s military. The two sides have been fighting since April 2023 in a calamitous civil war that has created one of the world’s greatest ongoing humanitarian crises . Last year, the United States determined that R.S.F. fighters, who are mostly ethnic Arabs, had committed genocide in late 2023 against the non-Arab Masalit group during their assault on El Geneina , a city in western Darfur. The accusations in the U.N. report suggest a similar pattern of ethnic targeting in El Fasher. Last fall, R.S.F. fighters filmed themselves carrying out executions and massacres as they swept through the city, generating global outrage. The U.N. report released on Thursday confirmed those accounts and framed them as part of a campaign targeting two other non-Arab groups, the Zaghawa and the Fur. Fighters starved, raped and killed civilians as part of a “planned and organized operation” to eliminate those groups, the report found. The report found that three of the five criteria in an international convention known colloquially as the “genocide convention” had been met. The siege of El Fasher began in May 2024 as the R.S.F. sought to rout the Sudanese military from its last stronghold in Darfur. It intensified early last summer after the R.S.F. was pushed out of Khartoum, Sudan’s capital. R.S.F. fighters encircled the city with a high earthen berm, starving 260,000 people trapped inside . Survivors cited in the U.N. report recalled intensive drone and artillery bombing and explicit threats to “clean” the city. The threats focused on the Zaghawa and Fur because men from those groups were fighting with militias that had allied themselves with Sudan’s military to defend a garrison in the city. When the R.S.F. finally seized El Fasher in late October, fighters executed fleeing civilians and survivors hid in piles of corpses. Some were blindfolded, bound and driven away as fighters chanted “slave, slave, slave,” the report said. A commander identified as Abu Lulu executed detainees in trenches and shot dead a pregnant woman after asking how far she was into her pregnancy, the report said. Survivors said that Abu Lulu had told prisoners that he would kill them “like fat autumn locusts” as he marched them to El Fasher University, one of the biggest execution sites. The R.S.F. said in October that it had arrested Abu Lulu after videos of him brutalizing civilians caused a global outcry. But the paramilitaries provided no evidence that he faced discipline or that he was still in custody, the U.N. report said. It also noted that the R.S.F. assault was backed by drones that struck hospitals and mosques and by foreign mercenaries, although it did not specify who supplied them. The New York Times and other outlets have reported that the United Arab Emirates supplied drones and other weapons used in the siege of El Fasher. In 2024, another group of U.N. investigators backed those findings . In December, the United States Treasury imposed sanctions on a network that it accused of sending Colombian mercenaries to El Fasher in support of the R.S.F., including a former Colombian soldier in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The Sentry, a Washington-based research and advocacy group, previously published corporate records showing that the mercenaries had been hired by an Emirati businessman who was a business partner of a senior Emirati official. In response to questions about those accusations, the Emirati foreign ministry said there was no evidence for “baseless claims associating the U.A.E. with violations of international law in Sudan.” Declan Walsh is the chief Africa correspondent for The Times based in Nairobi, Kenya.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT When President Harry S. Truman sought to add a balcony to White House in the 1940s, he faced opposition from the Commission of Fine Arts, which asserted that he was disfiguring a national monument. Mr. Truman pushed past that advice, built the balcony and, for good measure, later fired members of the commission who opposed him. Don’t expect any such fight this time. As President Trump seeks to build a $400 million White House ballroom, he has taken several steps to eliminate any pocket of resistance to his plans from within his administration, stacking the boards and commissions tasked with overseeing the project with allies, including several people who work directly for him and some with no notable background in the arts. Mr. Trump’s latest appointee to the Commission of Fine Arts, for instance, is his former receptionist Chamberlain Harris. The panel provides advice on the project, but cannot block Mr. Trump. The Cultural Landscape Foundation, an education and advocacy nonprofit based in Washington, objected to the new makeup of the panel this week, pointing out that the Commission of Fine Arts is supposed to include “experts in relevant disciplines, including art, architecture, landscape architecture and urban design.” But there are no landscape architects on the panel, which the cultural landscape organization says is a “monumental deficit since the commissioners will be making decisions about one of the nation’s most important and visible designed landscapes.” The White House has defended Mr. Trump’s picks, maintaining that they are more aligned with the president’s America First agenda. “President Trump has an incredible eye and appreciation for the arts, and only selects the most talented people possible,” said Davis Ingle, a White House spokesman. “These individuals possess a wealth of experience that reflects the values of everyday Americans and President Trump’s vision to make America great again.” Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that he planned to have the ballroom built and open to guests within a year and a half. In October, Mr. Trump abruptly tore down one side of the White House, demolishing the entire East Wing , which contained the historical offices of the first lady. What Trump’s Latest East Wing Designs Show The plans submitted by the White House include more windows, a new garden and an asymmetrical pathway. The administration has been under legal pressure from historical preservationists to submit the new ballroom project to a formal review process . So far, the initial construction on the project has been allowed to proceed , though a judge recently expressed deep skepticism about the government’s case. Here’s how the president is pushing through his project by remaking the panels that oversee construction in Washington: Replacing the architect Mr. Trump has faced much criticism that his plans for a White House ballroom are too large and that the building will dwarf the Executive Mansion and the West Wing. Trump Administration: Live Updates Updated Feb. 18, 2026, 11:45 p.m. ET A Trump order aims to boost a weedkiller targeted in health lawsuits. The U.N. Security Council meets on Gaza, a day before the Board of Peace gathers. A senior Justice Dept. official described dozens of violations of court orders in New Jersey as accidental. The president’s first architect on the ballroom project, James C. McCrery II, presented him with several smaller approaches. But Mr. Trump kept pushing for a bigger project. The men disagreed over the ballooning size of the ballroom, and eventually Mr. McCrery agreed to take a step back as the main architect on the project. He was replaced by Shalom Baranes, whose firm has been designing government buildings for decades and has collected awards for its commitment to historic preservation. Remaking the Commission of Fine Arts Mr. Trump also set out to remove other potential obstacles to his vision. He fired the entire board of the Commission of Fine Arts last year, and began appointing replacements this year. Among those appointed was Mr. McCrery, who has recused himself from discussing or voting on the project. Others include Ms. Harris, who works for Mr. Trump as the deputy director of Oval Office operations; Pamela Hughes Patenaude , who previously worked for Mr. Trump as the deputy secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development; and Mary Anne Carter, an ally of the White House chief of staff who serves as chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts. The new chairman of the panel, Rodney Mims Cook Jr., has made clear that he views his job as ensuring that the president’s project can go forward. “Our president has a very ambitious plan for the District of Columbia, as well as the world,” Mr. Cook said at the commission’s last meeting. “So we need to let the president do his job and, as best we can, keep his mind off of things like this, that we can keep him rolling, and do it as elegantly and beautifully as the American people deserve for generations and further centuries into the future.” Remaking the National Capital Planning Commission Mr. Trump has also assumed control of the leadership of the National Capital Planning Commission, although that panel also has representation from the D.C. government. The National Capital Planning Commission must approve Mr. Trump’s plans before he can begin construction. Mr. Trump has installed his former personal lawyer Will Scharf as the chairman of this panel. Mr. Scharf currently serves as assistant to the president and the White House staff secretary. He is known for presenting Mr. Trump with executive orders for him to sign in the Oval Office. Mr. Scharf made no objection when Mr. Trump abruptly tore down the East Wing to make way for the ballroom project. He maintained that his panel had no control over demolition, only new construction. The National Capital Planning Commission has put the ballroom project on a fast track for final approval at its meeting next month. Luke Broadwater covers the White House for The Times.

He reported from Washington. Feb. 19, 2026 This is a story about mud and power in Washington. It begins at the turn of the 20th century, when this was a smaller, swampier place. Back then, there were great mud flats clogging up the Potomac River, just south of where the Washington Monument stood. Ships could not pass over the shallows. Sewage collected there. A plan was made to build them up into something pretty. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers got to work, dredging the river, piling mud atop the marsh. The crescent-shaped island that appeared became an important piece of Washington’s modern geography. The Jefferson Memorial was built on the island’s western lip, which backs up to the Tidal Basin and the National Mall. The rest of the man-made island was turned into a public park called East Potomac. It’s a neat place. There are hundreds of cherry blossom trees, a road for cycling that wraps around the perimeter of the island, and a primo picnic area at its eastern tip. Most of the park is taken up by an affordable golf course that has been there in some form since the beginning. The course, East Potomac Golf Links, is a bit shabby, but the prices are unbeatable: $42 for 18 holes.

Library of Congress Not much had changed about East Potomac over the decades until one day last October when some dump trucks showed up. The trucks were sent by the White House. They were carrying mud. The trucks drove onto the golf course and, somewhere between the fourth and ninth holes, began dumping mounds and mounds of the stuff. Tiny bits of rebar, wiring and specks of white plaster poked out from the piles. Word quickly spread among the golfers about the mystery mud. Turned out it was the remains of the East Wing, which President Trump had demolished days earlier.

Mr. Trump has big plans for the little island. He wants to make it into a luxury golf destination. How exactly will he do this, you ask? Even he doesn’t seem to know yet, but one thing is certain: It’s going to take a lot of dirt to get it done. And there is a lot of dirt out back of the White House, where the big dig for the president’s ballroom grinds on. And so, week after week, the trucks show up and the mound in the middle of the golf course grows. A National Park Service memo estimated that there would be 30,000 cubic yards of soil. That would be about 2,000 truckloads in all. Image Fences around the dump site where debris and soil from the demolition of the White House East Wing is deposited in East Potomac Park. Credit... Kent Nishimura for The New York Times “We’re going to make it a beautiful, world-class, U.S. Open-caliber course,” Mr. Trump said when asked about this last month. “Ideally, we’re going to have major tournaments there and everything else. It’s going to bring a lot of business into Washington.” Not long after the dumping began, the Trump administration took full control of the course in East Potomac Park, terminating a lease that the National Park Service had with a nonprofit called National Links Trust, which managed that course as well as two others in the city. The idea that the billionaire president who operates more than a dozen of his own gold-plated golf clubs — he already has one on the Potomac, just a 45-minute drive upstream — would turn the proudly proletarian East Potomac course into a baby Bedminster has been profoundly depressing to many locals who love to play in the park. People tend to view golf as a rich man’s game, and maybe it is, but not in this park. A senior or a veteran can play nine holes for $16, and a kid can play for less. These little municipal courses (golfers call them munis) are places where anyone can meet up on a Saturday, play for a few bucks, have a hot dog and tell some jokes. No membership required. Image Image If Mr. Trump makes a championship course out of it, it’s likely to cost way more. The cheapest round on a recent day at Trump National Doral in Miami was $215. A hot dog was $24. Administration officials said it’s too soon to say how the government will manage such a course while keeping it affordable, or what will become of it after Mr. Trump leaves office in three years. Several of the top golf course architects in the country expressed puzzlement as to how Mr. Trump would go about constructing a “world-class” course that could host major tournaments on this peculiar spit of land. “I think it’s a crazy idea,” said Mark A. Mungeam, who is the president of the American Society of Golf Course Architects. It’s even crazier, some of the other architects mused, when you consider that Mr. Trump does actually know a lot about what goes into making an elite golf course. What would compel him to push for one here? “President Trump built some of the greatest golf courses in the world, and he is now extending his unmatched design skills and excellent eye for detail to D.C.’s public golf courses,” said Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman. “The president and his extraordinary team will redevelop these decrepit golf courses in our nation’s capital to restore glamour and prestige.” Trump Administration: Live Updates Updated Feb. 18, 2026, 11:45 p.m. ET A Trump order aims to boost a weedkiller targeted in health lawsuits. The U.N. Security Council meets on Gaza, a day before the Board of Peace gathers. A senior Justice Dept. official described dozens of violations of court orders in New Jersey as accidental. But it’s a public park. It wasn’t designed to be glamorous or prestigious. The president seems to be in some sort of Pharaonic legacy-building mode, treating the capital as his great sandbox. He has initiated so many construction projects, it’s hard to imagine how all of them will be completed (or even funded) by the time he leaves office. There’s the ballroom, the triumphal arch across the river, a proposed statue garden, plans to rip up Lafayette Park, whatever it is that’s about to happen to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and, now, a bit down river from that, there is this. A pattern emerges. His takeovers come suddenly and without warning. Vaguely defined promises of something gilded and grand follow. Blueprints, to the extent that they exist, are shrouded in opacity. There is no input accepted from the public or lawmakers. And people panic because, as Mr. Trump has demonstrated, he is willing to bulldoze things that have been around for a long time and that mean a lot to a lot of people — even if he promised he wouldn’t. This is how he operates. This is how he has always operated . Can He Really Do That? Image The East Potomac public course in the early 20th century. Credit... Library of Congress The pre-eminent expert on all things East Potomac Park is a man named Mike McCartin. Mr. McCartin, 44, grew up learning to play golf in the park with his father; wrote about the park for his master’s thesis on affordable golf; and eventually came to be in charge of the park’s course in 2020, when National Links Trust, the nonprofit he helped start, was awarded a 50-year-lease from the government at the end of the first Trump term. The park was, and is, in need of some tender loving care. It seems to be sinking back into the river at certain points. After years of flooding, the ground is s",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT In her bid to be Ohio’s next governor, Amy Acton sometimes warns audiences that her voice may trigger feelings. It’s the voice millions of Ohioans heard live from their televisions every afternoon at 2 p.m. during the earliest, darkest days of the coronavirus pandemic, as Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, and Dr. Acton, serving as his health director, delivered daily briefings on the virus. Now Dr. Acton is the presumptive Democratic nominee to succeed Mr. DeWine, and her voice provides a test for the political moment, six years postpandemic. Her service to Mr. DeWine, who is term-limited, could be a perfect calling card in an increasingly Republican state, marking her as a pragmatic moderate willing to work across party lines. But that service — running the Covid response — provokes intense emotions. In her race against the presumptive Republican nominee, Vivek Ramaswamy, a billionaire entrepreneur and one-time presidential candidate, the question is, which feelings will prevail? To many, Dr. Acton’s voice in the daily briefings was firm but reassuring. She inspired bobblehead dolls, little girls dressing up like her in white lab coats and admiring profiles in national publications. An animated tribute video substituted “DeWine and Amy” for the stars in the opening sequence of “Laverne & Shirley.” (“We’re gonna make our state pull through/Doin’ it our way!”) To many others, hers was the crushingly cautious voice of Dr. Doom. She issued a stay-at-home order to the state’s 11 million residents after three people had died. The state was the first to close its schools. As lockdown orders continued, angry small-business owners, anti-vaccine activists and men brandishing handguns demonstrated outside her house. Legislators tried to impeach her and called her antisemitic slurs (she is Jewish) at the same time they likened her orders to Nazism. Ohio, once a swing state, is challenging enough for any Democrat: It voted twice for Barack Obama, but no Democrat has won statewide since 2018. The state has elected only one Democrat as governor in the last 35 years. Image Dr. Acton speaks during a news conference during the pandemic, as Gov. Mike DeWine watches. Credit... Tony Dejak/Associated Press And running as the person who ran Covid response is a decidedly mixed blessing. Dr. Acton has wide name recognition and offers herself as a public servant — a doctor, not a politician. But for some people in Ohio and across the nation, the pandemic turned public health officials into public enemies , accused of misinformation, killing businesses and causing long-lasting damage to children shut out of school. “People hate that time in their life, they absolutely hated it,” said Jai Chabria, Mr. Ramaswamy’s chief strategist. “They also don’t want to talk about it, they don’t want to be reminded of it. The problem for her is, that’s who she is.” Dr. Acton said she believed her experience with Covid gave her the kind of deep connection with Ohioans that is forged in trying times. “Talking to them honestly, doing the things we did in that moment, created this bond,” she said. “Even hearing my voice brings back that sense” with voters, she added. Ohio showed success during Dr. Acton’s time in the Covid hot seat; a month in, the state had 193 deaths, while neighboring Michigan, with a smaller population, had 959. But in a preview of a campaign that promises to be ugly and the most expensive in state history, Mr. Ramaswamy has accused Dr. Acton of lying about death rates to justify lockdowns that damaged the state’s economy. He has mocked her for tearing up in briefings as the death toll rose, and for quitting her position three months into the pandemic — Dr. Acton says she stepped down because the Republican-led legislature was asking her to sign reopening orders that would have violated her Hippocratic oath to do no harm. 314 Action, an organization that works to elect scientists and doctors, counts 35 doctors, nurses, or public health professionals who are not incumbents and are running as Democrats for the House, Senate or governor. They are inspired in part by the Trump administrations cuts to health care and scientific research budgets, and the anti-science, anti-vaccine bent of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Mr. Trump’s top health official. Dr. Acton is betting that the nation is ready to shake off its political long Covid and vote instead on the rising costs of health care, heat and housing, and the turmoil of the Trump presidency. Image Yard signs in support of Dr. Acton can already be seen in Columbus. Credit... Jessica Phelps for The New York Times “People are exhausted,” she said. “They are exhausted at the hate, the chaos and vitriol, they’re exhausted of being pitted against one another, and they are struggling.” In Covid briefings, Dr. Acton implored Ohioans not to be afraid. She uses the same language now. “We can’t be afraid of this time in history,” she said in an interview. “This is a movement of people refusing to look the other way.” Dr. Acton, 60, grew up in Youngstown, a Northeast Ohio city synonymous with industrial decline. She was homeless for a time; she and her brother were what she calls “frequent fliers” with child services and lived in a tent for a winter. At 12, after accusing her stepfather of sexual abuse, she went to live with her father. With a new school and new stability, she went on to enter an accelerated medical school program straight out of high school. She is married to a 43-year public school teacher. Her story has drawn a contrast with Mr. Ramaswamy, a 40-year-old pharmaceutical entrepreneur and finance executive , especially among rural and working class voters. “Rural Ohioans want their candidates to be authentic, they want them to be genuine, they want them to be honest, and Amy exudes that,” said Chris Gibbs, a soybean, corn and cattle farmer who led the Shelby County Republican Party until 2015, and now leads the county’s Democratic Party. “As far as Covid,” he added, “to me, that’s ancient history.” Chris Mabe, a corrections officer and president of the Ohio Civil Service Employees Association, said he was impressed with Dr. Acton’s ability to connect with even skeptical voters after he noticed her lingering to talk to some of his members after her appearance at a recent union conference in Southeastern Ohio. Some were in tears, and he presumed they were giving her an earful about her pandemic response. In fact, he said, they were “saying, ‘thank you for being there.’” Tears — bipartisan tears — are common at her events. Dr. Acton herself says she has “never gotten out of a room without someone crying.” Image Dr. Acton surrounded by union leaders and representatives from around the state of Ohio as she received their endorsement in her bid for governor. Credit... Jessica Phelps for The New York Times But beyond the “R” next to his name, Mr. Ramaswamy likely will enter the general election after Ohio’s May 5 primary with a huge advantage. He has raised nearly four times as much money as Dr. Acton, $19.8 million to date, compared with her $5.3 million. By necessity, Dr. Acton is running a scrappy campaign. She has questioned his commitment to Ohio after he moved his financial services firm to Dallas from Columbus just before announcing his gubernatorial campaign. She has hammered him for using his jet to fly to campaign events around the state (he defends it as the most efficient way to reach its 88 counties) and for saying Medicare and Medicaid were “mistakes.” And both she and some of Mr. Ramaswamy’s detractors on the far right have used the candidates’s own words against him, especially his contention that American culture has “venerated mediocrity.” At the risk of reinforcing pandemic-era references, Dr. Acton calls herself the “Ted Lasso of politics” — the naïve underdog who walks onto the job not understanding the forces arrayed against him, then charms adversaries into fans. “In the end, as the ",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT President Trump issued an executive order late Wednesday aimed at spurring the domestic production of glyphosate, a widely used weedkiller that has figured in health lawsuits. The move immediately set off alarms among supporters of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again” movement, and appeared to put Mr. Kennedy in an awkward position. Glyphosate is the active ingredient in Roundup, which has been the target of tens of thousands of lawsuits that claim it causes non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In 2018, as a plaintiff’s lawyer, Mr. Kennedy helped win a landmark $289 million jury verdict against Monsanto, the maker of Roundup, in a case contending the company knew the weedkiller caused cancer. But in a statement issued through a spokesman Wednesday night, the health secretary said he supported the president. “Donald Trump’s executive order puts America first where it matters most — our defense readiness and our food supply,” Mr. Kennedy said in the statement. “We must safeguard America’s national security first, because all of our priorities depend on it.” Mr. Trump’s order invoked the Defense Production Act, a 1950s-era law typically used in national emergencies to compel companies to produce certain materials or supplies that the president deems necessary for national security. Mr. Trump declared both glyphosate and phosphorus, used to manufacture the weedkiller, “critical to the national defense.” “Lack of access to glyphosate-based herbicides would critically jeopardize agricultural productivity, adding pressure to the domestic food system,” Mr. Trump argued. He ordered the agriculture secretary, in consultation with the defense secretary, to “determine the proper nationwide priorities” and gave them authority to compel production of the materials “to ensure a continued and adequate supply” of phosphorous and glyphosate-based herbicides, if necessary. Some of Mr. Kennedy’s supporters, as well as environmental groups, were furious. “MAHA voters were promised health reform, not chemical entrenchment,” said Vani Hari, a healthy eating advocate and supporter of Mr. Kennedy’s nutrition agenda. She called the executive order “a direct assault on MAHA” and “a gift to pesticide and chemical industry lobbies at the expense of human health.” Ken Cook, the president and co-founder of Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization that has also supported parts of Mr. Kennedy’s agenda, said, “I can’t envision a bigger middle finger to every MAHA mom than this.” Mr. Kennedy has taken an aggressive posture on pesticides in the past. “The chemicals pollute our bodies the same way that they pollute the soil,” he said in 2024. In a report issued last year, a commission he chaired to examine the causes of chronic disease singled out glyphosate and another pesticide, atrazine, as potentially harmful to children. While many experts say the risks of glyphosate to the general population are low , bodies reviewing research have had differing conclusions. In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as “probably carcinogenic to humans.” Two years later, the Environmental Protection Agency said that glyphosate was “not likely to be carcinogenic to humans.” Late last year, a landmark study that had found glyphosate to be safe 25 years ago was retracted by the scientific journal that published it, undermining confidence in the science behind a weedkiller that has become integral to American food production. It is used on soybeans, corn and wheat, on specialty crops like almonds, and on cotton and in home gardens. The Defense Production Act provides a pathway for companies to be shielded from certain liability suits, and Mr. Trump’s order appeared to extend that protection to producers of glyphosate. The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments in weeks in a case that asks whether federal law shields pesticide manufacturers from such lawsuits. Last year, a coalition of environmental groups, MAHA activists and Democratic lawmakers defeated a provision tucked into a government spending bill that would have shielded Bayer and other pesticides makers from payouts to plaintiffs. A similar provision has now been introduced in the draft Farm Bill. Brett Hartl, director of government affairs for the Center for Biological Diversity, which has filed multiple lawsuits challenging the E.P.A.’s approval of the herbicide, said the provision raised red flags. “It’s alarming because it’s clearly designed to offer a broad immunity,” he said. Bayer, the German pharmaceutical and biotech giant that acquired Monsanto in 2018, announced on Tuesday that it had reached a tentative agreement that would pay plaintiffs $7.25 billion to settle tens of thousands of lawsuits that claimed Roundup caused cancer. The company maintains that the weedkiller is safe and an essential tool for farmers. The company will continue to press its case at the Supreme Court, Bill Anderson, Bayer’s chief executive, told investors on Tuesday. He said a favorable ruling would provide “the tightest possible form of containment” of litigation by settling existing cases and making future cases easier to win. In a statement on behalf of Monsanto, a Bayer spokesman said that Mr. Trump’s executive order “reinforces the critical need for U.S. farmers to have access to essential, domestically produced crop protection tools.” The company will “comply with this order to produce glyphosate and elemental phosphorus,” he said.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT A federal judge in Minnesota found a Trump administration lawyer in civil contempt of court on Wednesday, a significant escalation between the judiciary and the executive branch amid a ballooning caseload triggered by President Trump’s immigration raids and novel interpretations of law. According to the ruling, by Judge Laura M. Provinzino of Federal District Court in Minnesota, the government failed to return “identification documents” belonging to Rigoberto Soto Jimenez, a detained immigrant whom she had ordered to be released with all of his property returned. The judge ordered a $500 daily fine imposed on Matthew Isihara, an administration lawyer, for each day the documents are not returned, beginning on Friday. In Minnesota and elsewhere, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been arresting thousands of immigrants who have lived in the United States for years after entering the country illegally. “Judge Provinzino’s order is a lawless abuse of judicial power,” Daniel N. Rosen, the U.S. attorney for the District of Minnesota, said in a statement. An online profile belonging to Mr. Isihara identified him as a military judge advocate now detailed as a special assistant U.S. attorney. The case docket indicates that the contempt ruling came after a 93-minute hearing. Mr. Soto Jimenez, according to court filings, is a Mexican citizen who has lived in Minnesota since 2018 with his spouse, who is a lawful permanent resident. He was arrested on Jan. 14. Like many others, he filed a writ of habeas corpus, a legal challenge that asks the courts to consider whether his detention has any legal basis. The government’s lack of respect for court rulings stemming from such petitions has been raised by judges in the District of Minnesota, where the chief judge compiled a list of nearly 100 violations of court orders in habeas cases since Jan. 1, and in New Jersey, where the Justice Department admitted 52 violations since Dec. 5. Judge Provinzino, who spent years as a federal prosecutor, had ordered the government to release Mr. Soto Jimenez “from custody in Minnesota” by Feb. 13. An order she issued on Tuesday indicates that the government failed not only to return his documents, but also to release him in Minnesota as she had initially specified. In an interview, Erin M. Lins, Mr. Soto Jimenez’s attorney, said that the government had released his client without his documents in El Paso, where he was being held, and that he stayed in a shelter overnight before flying home. She said the government had located her client's documents and that she expected to receive them on Thursday. “I appreciate the government acting promptly after today’s hearing in resolving this,” she said. “It’s just unfortunate that it had to get to this point.” “Federal judges are at their wits’ end when it comes to the government,” said Muneer I. Ahmad, a Yale Law professor who represents immigrants as part of the school’s Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic. “Judges are no longer willing to give the benefit of the doubt to the federal government that they’re acting in good faith and with the integrity expected of government lawyers. It’s really quite extraordinary.” Mr. Ahmad said he believed that Wednesday’s ruling by Judge Provinzino, who was appointed by President Joseph R. Biden Jr., marked the first time that an official from Mr. Trump’s second presidential administration had been held in contempt of court. David A. Super, a law professor at Georgetown, agreed. “This is the first clear case of contempt this term that I know of,” he said. Unlike criminal contempt, he noted, civil contempt, which imposes penalties to induce compliance, is beyond the president’s pardon power. While civil contempt rulings are very uncommon, they are not entirely without precedent. A judge held Betsy DeVos, Mr. Trump’s education secretary during his first term, in civil contempt and fined the department she headed $100,000. Another federal judge, while stopping short of a contempt ruling, ordered lawyers from President Barack Obama’s Justice Department to undergo ethics training. Ernesto Londoño contributed reporting.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT An aide to Representative Tony Gonzales of Texas sent a text message to a co-worker last April saying that she had an affair with the Republican congressman, according to the co-worker who shared the text exchange with The New York Times. The text message, first reported on Tuesday by The San Antonio Express-News , and then obtained on Wednesday by The Times, has thrown Mr. Gonzales’s re-election fight into turmoil just as voters in Texas have begun casting primary ballots. The aide who said she had the affair died by suicide five months after sending the text, when she lit herself on fire in the backyard of her home. “I had affair with our boss and I’m fine,” the aide, Regina Ann Santos-Aviles, wrote last April 27, referring to Mr. Gonzales, a married father of six. Mr. Gonzales would not comment on allegations of an affair. The congressman, who has at times broken with President Trump but has the president’s endorsement, is locked in a tough primary fight with a challenger to his right, Brandon Herrera. Mr. Gonzales accused Mr. Herrera on Wednesday of being behind the release of the text message. The staff member who received the text is no longer working for Mr. Gonzales. The former aide said in an interview on Wednesday that he did not agree with Mr. Herrera’s hard-right politics, but decided to share screenshots of the text exchange with The Times because Ms. Santos-Aviles had been a friend and had been wronged by Mr. Gonzales. Mr. Gonzales said in the statement on Wednesday that Ms. Santos-Aviles had been a “kind soul who devoted her life to making the community a better place” but that he would not respond to the allegation of an affair. “I am not going to engage in these personal smears,” the congressman said, adding that he would instead “remain focused on helping President Trump secure the border and improve the lives of all Texans.” But on Wednesday evening, Bobby Barrera, an attorney for Ms. Santos-Aviles’ husband, Adrian Aviles, corroborated that Ms. Santos-Aviles confessed to her husband in June of 2024 that she had been having an affair with Mr. Gonzales for about a month. Mr. Aviles had come home and noticed his wife was texting someone. After he asked to see the phone, Mr. Barrera said he saw texts of Mr. Gonzales asking for a meeting with his wife and requesting photos of her. “She made the admission that she was having an affair with Tony Gonzales,” Mr. Barrera said. Mr. Barrera said she broke off the affair and lived apart from her husband. Marriage counseling failed. Ms. Santos-Aviles struggled mentally and felt ostracized at her work, the lawyer said. The night of her death, she told a friend that was wanted to harm herself and took a video of the incident. “People started making phone calls but by then it was too late,” he said. “It was terribly tragic.” Mr. Gonzales, a third-term congressman, narrowly survived a challenge from Mr. Herrera in 2024. His sprawling border district, which stretches from the San Antonio area to just outside El Paso, was drawn to favor a Republican, but in a year when the political winds favor the Democrats the district could now be in play. After The Express-News’s reporting, the newspaper’s editorial board rescinded its endorsement of Mr. Gonzales on Wednesday, saying that it would make no recommendation of a candidate in the race. Mr. Herrera, a hard-line gun-rights advocate and YouTuber known as the “AK guy,” seized on the publication of the text message and called on Mr. Gonzales to resign. He said that the allegation created a “tremendous potential catastrophe” for Republicans. “If he prevails in the primary,” Mr. Herrera said of Mr. Gonzales in a statement, “Democrats will seize the opportunity to flip a reliable Republican seat blue.” According to a screenshot of the text messages between Ms. Santos-Aviles and the former aide who spoke to The Times, Ms. Santos-Aviles appeared to mention a relationship with Mr. Gonzales in an attempt to reassure her co-worker, who was worried about issues at work. The former aide shared the messages with The Times and discussed his conversations with Ms. Santos-Aviles on the condition of anonymity out of concern for potential ramifications for his family in the small community around Uvalde, Texas. The former aide, who is now a political operative based in Los Angeles with at least one Democratic client, said he was politically in the center. He said he voted for Mr. Trump in one election but for Kamala Harris in 2024. He said he had been working in Mr. Gonzales’s district office alongside Ms. Santos-Aviles when she and the congressman went to a cabin along the Frio River that belonged to the former aide’s family. The former aide said the affair took place in May 2024, as Mr. Gonzales was preparing to run for re-election, but that it ended soon after, and the congressman was rarely if ever in the district afterward. “After that we never saw our boss,” the former aide said. He said Ms. Santos-Aviles first told him about the affair after the November 2024 election. Over the next several months, the former Gonzales aide said, Ms. Santos-Aviles became increasingly distraught. The two worked together for about two years and often traded text messages, he said. On Sept. 13, Ms. Santos sustained burn injuries while alone at her home in Uvalde, which she shared with her husband and 8-year-old son. She was taken to the emergency room where she later died. The chief of the Uvalde Police Department, Homer E. Delgado, said after the death that no “foul play” was suspected and that Ms. Santos-Aviles had been “alone in her backyard when the fire began.” The death drew immediate scrutiny, and the local medical examiner ultimately ruled it a suicide. In the months after, the possibility of an affair was widely discussed in political circles in the border district represented by Mr. Gonzales. Mr. Herrera made reference to the rumors of an affair last fall, which were reported by the conservative Texas news site Current Revolt. Mr. Gonzales responded to the rumors during an appearance at a festival hosted by The Texas Tribune in late November, saying, “The rumors are completely untruthful, and Regina’s family has asked for privacy.” Some members of Ms. Santos-Aviles’s family had also dismissed the idea of an affair, though her mother described her daughter as having trouble in her marriage and said she had been distressed before her death. “They were separated, but she was hoping to fix things,” her mother, Nora Gonzales, said of Ms. Santos-Aviles and her husband in a conversation with The Times last fall. “She loved her son very much.” On Wednesday, Ms. Gonzales, who is not related to the congressman, said that the revelations had reopened old wounds. “It’s just a shame that they are using her name in this political arena,” Ms. Gonzales said of her daughter. “I just don’t think her death had to do anything with his campaign.” Ms. Santos-Aviles’s husband declined to comment when reached on Wednesday. The president endorsed Mr. Gonzales in December on social media, after the rumors of an affair were already known in the district. “He will not let you down!” Mr. Trump wrote.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The rapid buildup of U.S. forces in the Middle East has progressed to the point that President Trump has the option to take military action against Iran as soon as this weekend, administration and Pentagon officials said, leaving the White House with high-stakes choices about pursuing diplomacy or war. Mr. Trump has given no indication that he has made a decision about how to proceed. But the drive to assemble a military force capable of striking Iran’s nuclear program, its ballistic missiles and accompanying launch sites has continued this week despite indirect talks between the two nations on Tuesday, with Iran seeking two weeks to come back with fleshed out proposals for a diplomatic resolution. Mr. Trump has repeatedly demanded that Iran give up its nuclear program, including agreeing not to enrich any more uranium. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, whose country would potentially take part in an attack, has been pushing for action to weaken Iran’s ability to launch missiles at Israel. Israeli forces, which have been on heightened alert for weeks, have been making more preparations for a possible war, and a meeting of Israel’s security cabinet was moved to Sunday from Thursday, according to two Israeli defense officials. Many administration officials have expressed skepticism about the prospects of reaching a diplomatic deal with Tehran. The indirect talks on Tuesday in Geneva ended with what Iran’s foreign minister said was agreement on a “set of guiding principles.” U.S. officials said the two sides made progress but added that big gaps remain. Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened that Iran must meet his terms or face severe consequences. But another attack, eight months after a 12-day war in which Israel and the United States assaulted military and nuclear sites across Iran, would potentially carry substantial risks, including that Iran would respond with a ferocious barrage of missile strikes on Israel and on U.S. forces in the region. For a president who ran for office promising to keep the United States out of wars, Mr. Trump is now considering what would be at least the seventh American military attack in another country in the past year, and his second on Iran. Last June, after striking three Iranian nuclear sites, Mr. Trump declared that Iran’s nuclear program had been “obliterated.” But now he is considering sending U.S. military back to continue the job. But unlike the U.S.-Israeli assault last June, Mr. Trump’s objectives now are less clear. The U.S. military buildup includes dozens of refueling tankers, rushed to the region by United States Central Command, more than 50 additional fighter jets, and two aircraft carrier strike groups, complete with their accompanying destroyers, cruisers and submarines, U.S. officials said. The aircraft carrier U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford , fresh from the Caribbean where it was part of the naval fleet pressuring the Venezuelan government of President Nicolás Maduro, was approaching Gibraltar on Wednesday as it made its way to join the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln in the region. “The president has always been very clear, though, with respect to Iran or any country around the world, diplomacy is always his first option, and Iran would be very wise to make a deal with President Trump and with this administration,” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said on Wednesday. “He’s always thinking about what’s in the best interest of the United States of America, of our military, of the American people, and that’s how he makes decisions with respect to military action,” she added. In Israel, the two defense officials said that significant preparations were underway for the possibility of a joint strike with the United States, even though no decision has been made about whether to carry out such an attack. They said the planning envisions delivering a severe blow over a number of days with the goal of forcing Iran into concessions at the negotiating table that it has so far been unwilling to make. The U.S. buildup suggests an array of possible Iranian targets, including short and medium range missiles, missile storage depots, nuclear sites and other military targets, such as headquarters of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The ultimate decision on scope of targets is largely up to Mr. Trump, U.S. officials said. Administration and military officials said the United States has bolstered its defensive assets since the president initially threatened to strike Iran in January. At the time, Mr. Trump had requested options to respond to the Iranian government’s bloody crackdown on protests. But more recently, he has threatened to attack if Iran failed to reach a deal to limit its nuclear program and said that a “massive Armada” was heading toward the country. Despite Mr. Trump’s tough stance, the Pentagon last month was in a poor position to back him up. The 30,000 to 40,000 U.S. troops scattered around the Middle East, including at eight permanent bases, were low on air defenses to protect them from expected retaliation. The additional fighter jets necessary to conduct the kind of operation Mr. Trump spoke of were idling at American bases in Europe, and as far away as the United States. Much of the military hardware in the Middle East accumulated over 20 years of war had since departed the region. But over the past month, the U.S. military has moved the necessary air defenses — including Patriot missile defense and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systems — into the region. Both systems can intercept Iranian ballistic missiles. One military official said the U.S. military could now defend its troops, allies and assets from any Iranian retaliation for American strikes on its nuclear and military targets, at least for a short campaign. But, the official said, the question remained as to whether the American military is ready to sustain a longer and wider war. The American buildup also includes dozens of additional F-35, F-22 and F-16 fighter jets that have been flowing from the United States to Europe and onward to the Middle East in recent days, according to flight tracking data and U.S. officials. Dozens of refueling planes, vital for a prolonged air campaign, have also been moved forward, those officials say. The second aircraft carrier, the Gerald Ford, and its three destroyer escorts could be in the Mediterranean by the weekend or early next week, military officials said. The Ford is likely to be deployed initially near the coast of Israel to defend Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities and towns, officials said. A military official said on Wednesday that the carriers have their own defense systems, including accompanying destroyers that can shoot down missiles aimed at them. It is difficult to hit an aircraft carrier with a ballistic missile, he said, if the carrier is moving rapidly. American B-2 bombers, which were used last year when Mr. Trump struck Iran, and other U.S.-based long-range bombers are on a higher alert status, officials said. Senior national security officials have told the president that any operation that aims to change the Iranian leadership is not guaranteed to be a success, the officials said. Mr. Trump’s decision to put off his threatened Iran strikes last month — which two administration officials said came about after military officials cautioned him that the Pentagon wasn’t ready — may have allowed Iran to better prepare for an attack. “Diplomacy may give the U.S. more time to get its military ready, but it also gives Iran more time to plan its retaliation,” said Vali Nasr, an Iran expert at Johns Hopkins University. “Ultimately,” he added, “the president has to weigh the cost of attacking Iran. Ironically his approach has made those costs more likely.” Tyler Pager contributed reporting. Helene Cooper is a Pentagon correspondent for The Times.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Stacy Bradley voted for President Trump because of his border policies, and she likes that he has restored “law and order.” But she is unsettled by one aspect of his immigration agenda. Last month, the federal government bought a warehouse next to her cheerleading gym in Surprise, Ariz., which the administration plans to convert into a detention center for up to 1,500 immigrants. Ms. Bradley, the co-owner of Woodlands Elite Cheer, said she worried that a detainee could escape, or that protests could break out. The children who train at her gym are as young as 3 and could see “people in shackles” next door, she said. “That’s a scary thing for a little kid to process,” Ms. Bradley said. Across the country, the Department of Homeland Security’s plans to buy industrial warehouses and turn them into detention centers for immigrants are running into local resistance, including in communities like Surprise that voted for Mr. Trump in the last presidential election. The pushback is complicating efforts to expand detention capacity to accommodate the tens of thousands of additional immigrants the administration expects to confine, to deliver on its mass deportation drive. Local officials and residents in at least a dozen areas have voiced opposition to the facilities, packing town hall meetings and expressing fears that the protests that recently shook Minneapolis could be unleashed in their backyards.

San Antonio 1,500 Those who object to the facilities say that the sites would diminish property tax revenue, harm local businesses and strain water and sewer infrastructure. They have also expressed humanitarian concerns over converting industrial warehouses into detention centers that could hold people for an average of 60 days . Nevertheless, the Trump administration is pressing forward in pursuit of its goal to expand its detention footprint to at least 100,000 beds, which will help it arrest, detain and deport more people. A D.H.S. official with knowledge of the plans, speaking anonymously to share internal information, said the expansion would allow the agency to avoid overcrowding. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has already faced complaints of crowded and unsafe conditions at many current facilities, including in hold rooms and processing centers that were not intended for long-term detention. Of the roughly 20 warehouses being eyed for purchase, at least eight have already been bought in states including Maryland, Georgia, Texas and Pennsylvania, according to internal Department of Homeland Security documents obtained by The New York Times. Some purchases collapsed in recent weeks in other areas as potential sellers faced mounting public backlash and canceled sales . The warehouses will be renovated to meet detention standards and provide food, medical and laundry services, according to ICE.

Cuccinelli II, an acting deputy homeland security secretary during the first Trump administration. “However, ICE is long overdue for setting up processing facilities all over the country.” He added: “These facilities will make ICE more efficient.” Around 68,000 people are currently in detention, according to the latest data from ICE . The new detention model is expected to allow ICE to expand its bed capacity to 92,600 by the end of November, according to a document from ICE describing its plans that was released last week by Kelly Ayotte, the Republican governor of New Hampshire, who had requested information from the agency. It would also greatly expand the number of permanent facilities owned and used exclusively by ICE. The vast majority of ICE detention facilities are currently owned and operated by private prison companies, and many of those facilities also house other federal prisoners. In a statement, an ICE spokesperson said the agency’s initial purchase of eight facilities would bring economic benefits to local communities, including thousands of jobs. The spokesperson added that the facilities would also be structured well and meet regular detention standards. The federal government plans to turn eight facilities into “large-scale detention centers” and 16 facilities into processing sites, according to the ICE document. The agency also intends to buy 10 detention facilities where ICE already operates. The administration’s expansion plan is set to cost about $38 billion, which will be drawn from the billions of dollars Congress approved last summer for Mr. Trump’s mass deportation campaign, the document says. ICE said that it had completed a “thorough due diligence process” before purchasing the facilities, including reviewing the water supply at each site before determining it to be “sufficient,” according to the document. Some detention facilities will need upgraded wastewater systems, the document says. Some local governments have tried to halt the federal government’s plans. In Oakwood, Ga., city officials released a statement last week urging residents to contact ICE directly to push for a pause and full review of the proposed location. Kansas City, Mo., passed a five-year moratorium on approvals for detention facilities not owned or managed by the city last month amid reports about ICE’s plan to buy a warehouse there. But many local officials say there is little they can do legally , because the federal government is generally exempt from local land use and zoning regulations. Some sales have fallen through after public fury intensified. Jim Pattison Developments, a Canadian company, said late last month that it would no longer sell a warehouse in Virginia to the Department of Homeland Security, after facing criticism and calls for a boycott. Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi, said in a social media post this month that a planned facility in Marshall County would not move forward after he spoke with Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary. “I appreciate her for agreeing to look elsewhere,” Mr. Wicker said in the post.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The Trump administration has violated more than 50 orders from federal judges in the District of New Jersey, all in cases involving immigrants’ challenging the legality of their detention, according to a court-ordered review conducted by a senior Justice Department official. The admission comes as federal judges around the country grapple with how best to address an emerging pattern of government noncompliance in immigration cases. Judges have castigated what they have described as the administration’s lawless approach in their rulings, summoned senior officials to their courtrooms to account for their lapses, and threatened to hold officials in contempt of court. In the New Jersey case, Judge Michael E. Farbiarz, who was appointed by President Joseph R. Biden Jr., ordered the administration to detail every instance in which it had failed to comply with a judicial order in the district since Dec. 5. In a response last week, Jordan Fox, the chief of staff to the deputy attorney general, filed an 11-page declaration describing 52 separate violations across 547 cases, describing them as accidental. She wrote that detainees were transferred 17 times despite court orders prohibiting them from being moved. The moves took place “inadvertently due to logistical delays,” she wrote. Another detainee, Jorge Moran-Rodriguez was flown to Peru in violation of a court order “due to an inadvertent administrative oversight” and then decided to stay “instead of return to the United States.” Mr. Moran-Rodriguez’s lawyer clarified that he chose to stay to avoid being returned only to be held in U.S. detention. “It’s not that he didn’t want to come back to the U.S. necessarily,” said his lawyer, Franklin S. Montero, in an interview. Mr. Montero also took issue with the government’s claim that its lapse was unintentional. “They knew they were not supposed to move Mr. Moran,” he said. A Justice Department spokeswoman said the department took a “very broad scope” in defining violations to report to the judge, including an instance in which a detainee was released nine minutes late. “To be sure, the Department of Justice is committed to complying with all court orders and doing so as quickly as possible, and this declaration outlines our extensive efforts to do so,” she said. Ms. Fox is also the current co-leader of the U.S. attorney’s office in New Jersey, a role she assumed after an appellate panel ruled that Mr. Trump’s choice to lead the office was serving unlawfully . In a letter accompanying her Friday filing, Ms. Fox wrote that “we regret deeply all violations for which our office is responsible.” She assured the court that the office “takes adherence to court orders very seriously” and that “adherence to court orders is a bedrock feature of our justice system.” Judges have repeatedly charged, however, that the administration hasn’t taken court orders seriously since the first weeks of President Trump’s second term. A recent flood of challenges to Mr. Trump’s effort to detain immigrants who entered the country illegally years ago has tested the courts’ capacity, the Justice Department’s bandwidth — and the administration’s respect for the judicial branch. Appearing before a judge in Minnesota, one federal prosecutor working immigration cases on a temporary basis, said it sometimes took “10 emails” and a “threat that I will walk out” to persuade her clients at the Department of Homeland Security to respond to her requests to comply with court orders. Judge Farbiarz ordered the New Jersey accounting after concluding that the Justice Department had violated one of his orders in the case of a petitioner, Baljinder Kumar, by removing him from New Jersey. Many details of the case are sealed, but Judge Farbiarz has ordered the release of some additional filings as early as Thursday. Ms. Fox’s recent filing wasn’t enough to fully satisfy Judge Farbiarz, who on Tuesday responded with an order praising Ms. Fox for being “careful” and thorough” but finding that the government’s compliance “falls below the relevant standards.” “Judicial orders should never be violated,” he wrote. “And they very rarely are, especially not by government officials.” He gave the government until next Wednesday to detail what it was doing “to ensure 100 percent compliance.” He proposed that the government commit to stop transferring any detainee who had filed a habeas petition, instead of waiting for a judge to rule. Immigrants have filed thousands of detention challenges, known as habeas corpus petitions, this year. Transferring people who have filed with the court, without a judge’s permission, is generally prohibited by federal rules. Ms. Fox reported in her filing that most detainees transferred in violation of a judge’s order since December have now been returned to New Jersey. But in six cases, Ms. Fox’s filing gives a cursory summary of the case without specifying where the wrongly-transferred detainees are currently, or a timeline for their return. Nor does it make clear what was preventing Immigration and Customs Enforcement from promptly circulating and complying with judicial orders. The District of New Jersey is one of 94 federal judicial districts; in the District of Minnesota the chief judge said in an order last month that he had determined that ICE had violated nearly 100 court orders since Jan. 1, a figure he said was “almost certainly substantially understated.” Since Mr. Trump returned to office, New Jersey has emerged as a crucial hub for ICE to hold and transport detainees picked up in the Northeast, including in nearby New York City , an immigrant-rich metropolis where ICE does not have long-term detention facilities. Most ICE detainees in New Jersey are sent to two privately-run detention facilities, in Elizabeth and Newark. The detention centers have filled up in recent months as ICE has scaled up arrests in the New York suburbs and in parts of New Jersey, including near a church in Union City over the weekend. The detention center in Newark, a 1,000-bed compound known as Delaney Hall, has been the subject of complaints and controversy since Geo Group, one of the country’s largest private prison companies, opened it last year. In June, four men escaped from the facility following days of unrest over the living conditions inside. While many detainees in New Jersey are held in the state as their deportation cases wind through the courts, others are transferred elsewhere as ICE moves to deport them or seeks to make space for other detainees. They are typically flown from Newark Liberty International Airport to detention centers in other states or deportation staging facilities in the South, mostly in Louisiana.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Republicans are brawling, Democrats are dreaming of being competitive and money is pouring in . It must be election season in Texas. Indeed, we are now less than two weeks out from the first major Senate primary contests of the year. In recent days, both the Republican and Democratic Senate primaries in Texas have kicked into high gear, so it seems like a good moment to take stock of the races as early voting gets underway . Let’s start with the Democrats, who have spent the last three decades losing at the statewide level — but who can’t help hoping that this year, in this environment , against the right Republican opponent, could be different. State Representative James Talarico , a Democratic candidate for Senate, made national headlines this week thanks to Stephen Colbert . Colbert said on his late-night show that his network, CBS, stopped him from airing an interview with Talarico because of Trump administration guidance about equal airtime for political candidates. CBS contested this account. But one thing is indisputable: The dust-up turned Talarico into a national Trump foil at a critical moment in the race — and Democratic activists love nothing more than a candidate at odds with the president. Talarico’s team announced on Wednesday that his campaign had raked in “$2.5 million in a 24-hour period after his censored ‘The Late Show’ appearance — marking the largest fund-raising day of his entire campaign.” It’s a dose of momentum just as voters are really tuning in — something his chief opponent, Representative Jasmine Crockett , seemed to acknowledge in an interview on MS Now. “It probably gave my opponent the boost he was looking for,” conceded Crockett, who has separately also suggested that there is more to the story than Colbert’s account indicated. But asked if she had had any problem with the prospect of the Talarico interview airing, she said she did not. Spurts of national stardom do not always translate for Texas Democrats, and this contest remains wild, ugly and unpredictable. Available polling is all over the place . Some surveys show Talarico up, others have Crockett ahead. Crockett is very popular with Black voters, a crucial part of the Democratic coalition — and she established herself long ago as a Democratic firebrand willing to take the fight to Republicans, sometimes using provocative language to do so. Crockett, a Black woman, has said efforts to question her electability amount to a “dog whistle.” Republicans are talking about November, too, with Senator John Cornyn warning increasingly urgently that the scandal-tarred Ken Paxton , the Texas attorney general, could hand Democrats a Senate seat and hurt down-ballot Republicans if he unseats Cornyn for the G.O.P. nomination. (This, by the way, is the Democratic hope — that the hard-right Paxton, with his history of legal troubles , would be unacceptable to enough voters that a serious Democratic candidate could make a credible run for the seat.) Limited available polling, however, has generally shown Paxton with a lead, even as the Republican establishment and other veterans of state politics, like former Gov. Rick Perry, have gone all-in for Cornyn. Representative Wesley Hunt is also running and taking a share of the non-Paxton vote. President Trump , whose endorsement would be meaningful, especially if he went to bat for Cornyn, instead declared this week that “I support all three.” It seems likely the primary will go to a runoff. We’ll continue following Texas closely in the lead-up to the March 3 races. In the meantime — for our readers in Texas and beyond — I’d love to hear how you’re thinking about these contests, and if you have a favorite candidate. I’m at katie.glueck@nytimes.com.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Four journalists investigating a secretive Trump administration effort to deport migrants to the African nation of Cameroon were detained on Tuesday, according to two of the people detained. The journalists, along with a lawyer representing most of 15 detained migrants, were seized by the police at a state-run compound in Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, where they were interviewing the deportees. The New York Times reported on Saturday that the compound was a detention center for African migrants who were recently deported from the United States by the Department of Homeland Security. None of the deportees are Cameroonian citizens. And almost all had received protection from American courts, which banned the government from sending them back to their home countries, where they would most likely face persecution, according to government documents obtained by The Times and interviews with their lawyers. The five people detained on Tuesday were taken to the judicial police headquarters, where the journalists were separated and interrogated, according to Joseph Awah Fru, the lawyer supporting the deportees, and Randy Joe Sa’ah, a freelance journalist who regularly works for the BBC and was one of the detainees. The three other journalists — a reporter, a photojournalist and a videographer — were based in Cameroon and working on assignment for The Associated Press. The A.P. said that, according to its understanding, the reporter was slapped but “did not sustain serious injury.” Some of the journalists, Mr. Fru and Mr. Sa’ah said, were kept in a cell for hours. The two men said the A.P. reporter appeared to have been beaten up and had told them the police had attacked him. All of the five were later freed. Before the journalists were released, the police confiscated their phones, cameras and laptops, saying the journalists had captured sensitive government information, according to Mr. Fru and Mr. Sa’ah. It was unclear if any had been charged. Cameroon’s Ministry of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment, and the police headquarters could not be reached through public phone numbers. The Trump administration has not publicly announced any deal with Cameroon to accept foreign deportees. The State Department said on Friday it would not comment on its “diplomatic communications with other governments” when asked about the terms of an agreement. The expulsions have raised concerns about human rights and the secrecy of President Trump’s approach to global deportations. Several of the migrants in the detention center who arrived there in January said they had felt pressured by the local authorities to return to their home countries or face indefinite detention in Cameroon, according to four people on the flight interviewed by The Times. “The state cannot prevent the public from knowing where they are keeping deportees who are not even citizens,” said Mr. Fru, the lawyer supporting the deportees. “That goes to the whole idea of shady deals in the dark.” Through deals forged with willing governments — often in exchange for cash — the United States has deported hundreds of people to countries that may not respect the removal protections they have been granted in U.S. courts, returning some of them to the dangers they fled .

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Leslie Wexner, the retail billionaire who helped Jeffrey Epstein build his wealth, did not refuse to answer questions during a six-hour, closed-door deposition on Wednesday before the House Oversight Committee. But he may as well have, Democrats said after spending the day in his hometown of New Albany, Ohio, questioning him as part of the committee’s investigation into Mr. Epstein. House Democrats said that Mr. Wexner, the former chief executive of Victoria’s Secret and a prolific donor to Republican candidates, repeatedly denied having any personal relationship with Mr. Epstein and said he had been “conned” by the financier and sex offender, but had done nothing wrong. In an opening statement he provided to the committee, Mr. Wexner, 88, described himself as “naïve, foolish, and gullible to put any trust in Jeffrey Epstein.” He added: “He was a con man. And while I was conned, I have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide.” But Democrats emerged skeptical of anything that Mr. Wexner shared with them, calling him a lucid, competent witness who was simply not telling the truth. “He’s claiming there was no friendship with Jeffrey Epstein,” Representative Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the oversight panel, said at a news conference during a break in the deposition, a claim he dismissed as “bogus.” Mr. Wexner also told them that he had not been questioned by the F.B.I. or the Justice Department, Democrats said. “He is someone who has been named by survivors, someone who is in the files more than most people, someone who is clearly the financial benefactor to Jeffrey Epstein,” Mr. Garcia said. “What the hell is going on?” Mr. Wexner said in his statement that he had hired Mr. Epstein to manage his personal finances and granted him power of attorney. He said that “Epstein lived a double life” and revealed to him only the “sophisticated financial guru” side while hiding the one that committed “unthinkable crimes.” He said that after discovering in 2007 that Mr. Epstein stole “vast sums from our family,” Mr. Wexner cut him off and never spoke to him again. House Republicans did not attend the deposition on Wednesday. Representative James E. Comer of Kentucky, the chairman of the committee, could not attend because of a major oral surgery that had been previously scheduled, a spokeswoman said. The depositions were led by staff. “He claims to want to provide information be helpful in the investigation, but then quickly follows up by saying that he does not recall details around a relationship with somebody that he had for decades,” said Representative Yassamin Ansari, Democrat of Arizona. Mr. Wexner explained his presence on Mr. Epstein’s private island, she said, by saying that he had been there once, for one hour, and walked around with his family. Representative David Min, Democrat of California, summed up Mr. Wexner’s testimony by saying that “he has basically alleged that he saw no evil, heard no evil — despite being in the room with Jeffrey Epstein over and over.” He added: “It’s really just not credible. To give that much trust to Jeffrey Epstein and then to say, ‘I don’t remember seeing any young girls, I didn’t hear anything about Jeffrey Epstein,’ it really is just not plausible.” A Republican spokeswoman for the committee, however, had a different take. “Les Wexner answered every question asked of him at today’s deposition,” she said, promising that the committee would soon release the video and transcript.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The U.S. economy slowed at the end of 2025, capping a volatile year in which growth ultimately held firm, as resilient consumers and an A.I. investment boom helped keep growth on track despite tariffs, uncertainty and the longest government shutdown in history. Gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, grew at a 1.4 percent annual rate in the final three months of the year, the Commerce Department said on Friday. That was down sharply from a 4.4 percent rate in the third quarter, partly because of the prolonged shutdown. For 2025 as a whole, measured from the end of 2024, G.D.P. increased 2.2 percent, compared with 2.3 percent the previous year. The numbers are preliminary and will be revised at least twice in the coming months. Growth in the fourth quarter was dragged down by the 43-day federal government shutdown, which left hundreds of thousands of public sector employees temporarily without paychecks. Furloughed workers eventually received back-pay, and economists believe the shutdown’s long-term impact on G.D.P. will be small. But the episode may have lowered growth by about 1 percentage point at the end of 2025; the subsequent rebound should lift growth by a similar amount in early 2026.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Image Image A big sell-off in the shares of private credit firms has the market on edge. Credit... Brendan McDermid/Reuters In today's newsletter: Has the reckoning started for private credit? A different inflation problem Picture of the day A new kind of global trade alliance Andrew here. Anxiety about private credit is growing following a strategic flip-flop from Blue Owl Capital, which lent aggressively to software companies now being disrupted by artificial intelligence. A major source of concern is the broad push to sell “semi-liquid” instruments to U.S. retail investors. Billed as the future of private equity, these vehicles have a big flaw: They can “gate” investor withdrawals. It’s a mechanism meant to protect the fund during market upheaval — but it can also further undermine investor confidence. If the industry is dead-set on attracting retail investors, it may be time to change how these vehicles work. Here’s an idea: Why not move these assets into so-called target-date funds with longer time horizons? It could ensure that only those who won’t need their money for decades are invested. In other words, it may reduce the risk of a “run on the bank” while giving savers the yield they crave. Has the reckoning started for private credit? Shares in private credit giants — especially Blue Owl Capital, the particularly hard-hit lender — remain under pressure this morning after a blood bath on Thursday. Yet while some on Wall Street remain confident about the sector, others warn that a potential reckoning may have only just begun. The latest: The stocks of lenders including Apollo, Ares and Blackstone were shellacked on Thursday after Blue Owl altered how investors in one of its most prominent funds can withdraw (or “redeem”) their money. Blue Owl said it would decide how much investors can take back every quarter, rather than letting them redeem a set amount. Investors have worried about private credit for months now, after it soared in popularity in recent years . Skeptics of private credit have warned that the lightly regulated sector could face big losses if an economic downturn reveals that lenders had overextended themselves with bad loans. (Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase memorably warned last fall of potential “cockroaches” coming to light.) More recently, private credit investors have worried about stock swoons for enterprise software companies , to which private lenders are heavily exposed. Was the Blue Owl fund a “canary in the coal mine?” That metaphor was used by observers including Mohamed El-Erian , the former C.E.O. of Pimco. Dan Rasmussen , the founder of the investment firm Verdad, predicted to CNBC, “The private markets bubble is finally starting to burst.” Defenders say that’s not necessarily the case. Blue Owl disclosed that it had sold $1.4 billion worth of loans from three funds, taking virtually no loss. Nearly half of the proceeds went to redeem investors in one of the funds. “I’m getting congratulations from everyone in our industry,” Craig Packer, a Blue Owl co-president, told The Times about the loan sale. Bill Katz, an analyst at TD Cowen, wrote in a research note on Thursday that the transaction suggested “there are no ‘cockroaches’ lurking in the portfolio.” That said, shares in Blue Owl are down in premarket trading on Friday. Keep an eye on Washington. While the Trump administration has introduced rules making it easier for individual investors to put money in private equity, including private credit, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also pushed to deregulate banks to help them better compete . Senator Elizabeth Warren , Democrat of Massachusetts, urged the Trump administration on Thursday to “wake up” and demand more disclosures and stress tests for private lenders — especially with retail investors’ money on the line in funds like the Blue Owl vehicle. If Democrats make gains in the midterm elections, expect potentially more heat on the sector. HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING The fallout from the Epstein files spreads. Bill Gates canceled a speech for an artificial intelligence event in India amid renewed scrutiny over his ties to Jeffrey Epstein. Emails have emerged showing Ben Goertzel , a prominent A.I. researcher, congratulating Epstein on his release from jail after being convicted of sex crimes. An advisory firm founded by Peter Mandelson, the veteran British politician and longtime Epstein friend, collapsed . And Bard College has begun an “independent review” into its president over his ties to Epstein. U.S. imports hit a record in 2025, in spite of President Trump’s tariffs. Imports rose 5 percent last year to $4.3 trillion , even as the trade deficit fell slightly to $901.5 billion. That meant America continued to be a net importer , despite Trump arguing that the levies would make the U.S. a major exporter. Of note: Imports of goods from China dropped nearly 30 percent, to their lowest level since 2009 — but U.S. exports to China fell by nearly as much. New York drops a plan to allow robotaxis. Gov. Kathy Hochul pulled a proposal that would have allowed commercial autonomous vehicles to operate outside of New York City, which labor groups and taxi drivers had opposed. The decision is a blow to Alphabet’s Waymo (which planned to provide more than one million paid weekly robotaxi rides in the U.S. by the end of 2026), Tesla and other service providers. Image A different inflation problem President Trump and Fed policymakers largely agree that the economy is doing fine. But when it comes to America’s affordability crunch, an issue of huge importance to voters, the president and central bankers are growing further apart. That widening gap may cause problems for Kevin Warsh, the president’s pick to succeed Jay Powell as Fed chair after his term expires in May. The situation that awaits Warsh could come into sharper focus later this morning with the release of the Consumer Price Expenditures report, the Fed’s preferred measure on inflation. It’s expected to show that inflation in December remained well above the Fed’s 2 percent target and was showing little sign of easing. The White House and Wall Street will also be watching the Supreme Court. The court is slated to release its latest opinions on Friday, and next Tuesday and Wednesday. Businesses have been anxiously awaiting the justices’ ruling on the legality of Trump’s most bruising tariffs, those justified under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. Trump took on inflation and tariffs on Thursday. If the court were to invalidate the tariffs, most importers would rejoice. (New research by the JPMorganChase Institute shows that tariffs are especially walloping midsize U.S. businesses .) But that would also wipe out a potential windfall that the administration hoped to use to plug the country’s giant debt hole. “Without tariffs, this country would be in so much trouble right now,” Trump told supporters at a steel plant in northwestern Georgia. The president continued to play down inflation. He called the affordability crisis “ fake news ” on Thursday, arguing, without evidence, that he had vanquished the problem. But economists and business leaders continue to worry that a two-tiered — or K-shaped — economy is emerging in which high-wage earners are weathering high inflation while poorer households struggle. And a new inflation risk has emerged. The price of Brent crude has soared this week — it stabilized this morning around $71 a barrel — as the The Times has reported that the president is weighing strikes against Iran . Military action could disrupt a key oil exporting trade route. Trump said on Thursday that Iran would need to reach a deal with Washington over the next 10 to 15 days, “ otherwise bad things happen ” — a timeline that has left markets on edge. The uncertainty about inflation is becoming harder to ignore. Stephen Miran, the former White House economic adviser who joined the Fed last year, appe",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT There were traders wearing “Dow 50,000” caps, and bright chyrons on CNBC. Attorney General Pam Bondi told lawmakers in Congress that they, too, should be making a big deal of the Dow Jones industrial average’s crossing 50,000 for the first time. To Ms. Bondi, the Dow’s ascent was evidence that the Trump administration’s economic policies were working. She also noted that the S&P 500, another benchmark stock index, was at “almost 7,000” and that the Nasdaq Composite index, which is full of tech stocks, was “smashing records.” “Americans’ 401(k)s and retirement savings are booming,” she said. To many analysts and investors, however, the message the market is sending is far more ambiguous. The Dow has yet to spend a day above 50,000 since Ms. Bondi’s appearance on Capitol Hill last week. The S&P 500 still has yet to close above 7,000, and the Nasdaq Composite last smashed its record high in October. Major stock indexes have mostly been treading water for months, while shares in certain companies have been splashing about, erratically. More than a fifth of the stocks in the S&P 500 have moved by 20 percent or more so far in 2026. Roughly 80 of those stocks have risen, while 40 of them have fallen, even as the main index has remained roughly flat. The Vix volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, has steadily gone up this year, and oil prices are rising this week amid mounting threats that the United States will attack Iran. The stock market sell-off has been led by sharp drops for software companies that are considered at risk of displacement by artificial intelligence. But investors have also been dumping many of the marquee tech names whose share prices have ridden a wave of A.I. exuberance. Investors are growing more worried that the reality of A.I. will fall short of the market’s lofty expectations. “There are a lot of unanswered questions,” said Tiffany Wilding, an economist at the asset manager PIMCO, pointing to the labor market as one area where A.I.’s impact is hard to predict. “Whether A.I. will primarily be a substitute or a complement for labor, how quickly it diffuses across the economy and ultimately who wins versus loses are all very difficult to forecast.” Shares of Apple, Meta, Broadcom, Alphabet, Advanced Micro Devices, Palantir and Microsoft, among the biggest winners from the A.I. trade, have all fallen this year. Nvidia, the engine of the stock market in recent years, has also sputtered, trading only slightly higher for the year through Thursday. As investors have sought to diversify away from flagging enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, two sectors that have seen a sustained rise are energy and industrial stocks. Consumer staples companies have also surged this year, with Clorox and Hershey rising more than 20 percent. Materials companies like Ball and Newmont have also risen over 20 percent. Dow Inc. is up 34 percent this year. Energy companies are also rising, with Texas Pacific Land Corporation, a major landowner in the Texas oil patch, up roughly 70 percent this year. President Trump made oil central to the terms of a deal with the Venezuelan government after the United States invaded the country and captured its leader. Oil prices rose sharply again this week as U.S. tensions with Iran intensified. Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, has gone up roughly $10 per barrel this year, to around $72. Brent crude oil price “In our view, this might be a good time for investors to step off the A.I. hype train,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise. This shift in the market has favored the Dow Jones industrial average, or “the Dow,” which is up 3 percent this year and 6.5 percent since October, outpacing the S&P 500. The Nasdaq Composite has turned negative for the year. There is no doubt that the Dow remains incredibly culturally significant in American financial markets. In practice, however, Wall Street analysts, traders and economists place more emphasis on the S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite and other stock benchmarks. It comes down to three main reasons. First, very little money still tracks the Dow, with mutual funds preferring to tie their performance to other indexes. This makes the Dow less relevant to the average stockholder because other indexes will better reflect their own portfolio. Second, a stock’s weighting in the Dow depends on its price, not the company’s overall value. That means small companies with high stock prices can have a bigger impact on the index than very large companies with low stock prices. Finally, with a cohort of just 30 companies, the Dow is less reflective of the U.S. economy than other indexes. Those 30 stocks do include some of the newer tech companies that have come to dominate the American economy, but the index is still largely made up of banks, industrial companies and other businesses more reflective of the economy as it once was, but not so much as it is now. Still, they are the companies benefiting from a shift away from technology stocks and A.I.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT President Trump’s desire for significantly lower borrowing costs has run into a perpetual problem since he returned to the White House. The economy is simply not calling for that kind of support from the Federal Reserve. But a new rationale for relief that seeks to overcome this hitch has begun to gain traction. It centers on artificial intelligence and the possibility of a productivity boom that will unleash higher economic growth without stoking inflation. That, in turn, could give the Fed space to cut interest rates, the argument goes. One of the biggest proponents of this view is Kevin M. Warsh , whom Mr. Trump wants to replace Jerome H. Powell as Fed chair. Before being tapped for the job, Mr. Warsh characterized the A.I. boom as “the most productivity-enhancing wave of our lifetimes — past, present and future.” He surmised that the technology would be “structurally disinflationary,” like the internet, although conceded that the full economic impact would take time to materialize. “My sense is that the anecdotes will be there before the data,” Mr. Warsh said, forcing central bankers to “make a bet” on leaning into a potential productivity surge. Mr. Warsh might be ready to make that wager if he is confirmed by the Senate, but his soon-to-be colleagues at the Fed appear far less convinced, especially given their growing skepticism about the need to cut rates further after another year of inflation above their 2 percent target. “I expect that the A.I. boom is unlikely to be a reason for lowering policy rates,” Michael S. Barr, a Fed governor, said just this week . Mr. Barr’s comments are so far the most direct on the issue, but other policymakers appear aligned. “I don’t think we are anywhere close yet to having evidence that A.I. has increased potential output that significantly,” said Athanasios Orphanides, formerly a governor at the Central Bank of Cyprus and a senior adviser at the Fed who is now at M.I.T. Sloan School of Management. “That’s why it’s tricky to use this argument to say this clearly justifies lower rates today.” 1990s Redux? Mr. Warsh’s argument relies on a simple premise. Ordinarily, the economy can grow only so quickly without triggering inflation. If factories are operating at full capacity, workers are all employed and companies are doing as much business as they can handle, then any increase in spending will result just in higher prices, not greater output. But if something — a technological breakthrough, an innovative management approach — allows businesses to produce more with the same number of workers, then output can rise without inflation picking up. That is what Mr. Warsh and others argue is happening now. And they say there is a historical precedent: the personal computing revolution of the 1990s. In the latter part of that decade, economic growth accelerated, the unemployment rate fell to historic lows, and the stock market boomed. Many economists, including some at the Fed, argued that the central bank should begin raising rates to cool off the economy and prevent a pickup in inflation. Alan Greenspan, then the Fed chair, disagreed, arguing that the United States was in the early stages of a technology-driven increase in productivity growth. He resisted the call to raise rates, arguing in a 1997 Fed meeting that the economy was in “a very unusual era.” “The pickup in productivity helps to explain why inflation remains so well contained at this stage in the expansion, despite the increasingly tight labor markets and other developments that, on the basis of our historical models, would have produced significant inflation,” Mr. Greenspan said at the time, according to meeting transcripts . Image Alan Greenspan, who as the Federal Reserve chair in the 1990s argued that the United States was in the early stages of a technology-driven increase in productivity growth. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times But critics point to differences between the two periods. For one, other factors were helping to keep a lid on inflation during Mr. Greenspan’s tenure, including rapid globalization and rising immigration. Today, the opposite is true, with Mr. Trump’s tariffs fracturing trade relations and his immigration crackdown shrinking the work force. “It’s so different that it creates sufficient uncertainty that you would not want to cut rates pre-emptively,” said Matthew Luzzetti, chief economist at Deutsche Bank. In fact, under Mr. Greenspan, the Fed was debating whether to raise rates, not whether to cut them. And while policymakers held off on making any moves for a while, they eventually did raise rates once inflation began to pick up. “Greenspan never cut rates because of productivity,” said Aditya Bhave, an economist at Bank of America. “He resisted the committee’s call to hike rates because of productivity, and he turned out to be right for a bit, and ultimately they wound up hiking anyway.” Measuring the Boom Many economists also argue that it is far from clear that the United States is in the midst of an A.I.-driven productivity boom — or a productivity boom at all. According to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, labor productivity was up 1.9 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, a respectable but hardly spectacular growth rate. That number will almost certainly be revised higher in subsequent updates to account for job growth that was slower in 2025 than initially reported — if fewer workers produced the same amount of economic output, then by definition their productivity was higher. But that anticipated revision only highlights the challenge: Productivity is notoriously hard to measure in real time. Even more than with employment, inflation and other statistics, productivity figures often change drastically as more complete data becomes available. Even when the numbers don’t change, they can be hard to interpret. Early in the pandemic, for example, productivity soared, but not because workers suddenly became better at their jobs. Low-productivity sectors like hospitality largely shut down, making overall productivity, on average, appear artificially high. “It is important to keep in mind that it’s a noisy series,” said Martha Gimbel, executive director of the Budget Lab at Yale University. “You should never hang your hat on one or two quarters of economic data, but that is particularly risky with productivity.” Even if the recent pickup in productivity is real, it isn’t clear that it’s driven by artificial intelligence, or that the gains will last. Some individual companies have begun reporting that they are seeing the benefits of artificial intelligence, but the evidence linking those gains to overall productivity growth is thin . That isn’t necessarily surprising. Research into past technological revolutions has found that they often follow a J-shaped pattern, where productivity growth initially slows as companies figure out how best to take advantage of the new technology, before it later accelerates. “That doesn’t mean it will never happen,” Ms. Gimbel said. “It just means that change is not immediate, and just because something is happening at an individual firm or for a very specific group of workers does not mean that it’s an economywide phenomenon.” Still, some prominent economists are less skeptical of A.I.’s impact. In a recent article in The Financial Times , Erik Brynjolfsson, a Stanford economist who has studied A.I., argued that the recent pickup in productivity, combined with evidence from specific industries and companies, suggests that the economy is “now transitioning out of this investment phase into a harvest phase” where productivity gains will be more substantial. Convincing the Committee Fed officials have stopped short of making definitive arguments about A.I. and its impact on productivity in light of these uncertainties. They have, however, started to debate the topic more vigorously. Officials discussed productivity gains at",

Other key markets like Germany and France also recorded significant declines, while Britain, the largest long-haul source market for U.S. tourism, saw a marginal growth of 0.5 percent compared to the previous year. “When 11 million international visitors aren’t showing up, the result is billions of dollars in economic losses to the travel industry,” said Erik Hansen, a senior vice-president at the U.S. Travel Association, a trade group that promotes travel to and within the country. Visa Fees and Social Media Vetting The Trump administration has made it significantly harder for some travelers to enter the United States, barring visitors from more than a dozen countries and introducing a $250 “visa integrity fee” for nonimmigrant tourist and business visas designed to discourage visitors from overstaying. Visitors are also facing more rigorous vetting at the border, with increased searches of electronic devices , some resulting in detentions and denied entry. Citizens of countrieswho just need an electronic authorization to visit the United States may soon be required to provide up to five years of social media history to enter; that could result in a loss of up to $15.7 billion in visitor spending, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council. “These are the kinds of measures you expect from China or countries in the Middle East, not from America,” said Felicity Morgan, 49, a British trade auditor who lives between Amsterdam and London,referring to detentions at airports linked to social media screenings for content deemed critical of the government or a risk to national security. Last month, she canceled a trip to Miami for her friend’s 50th birthday because she didn’t want to risk losing thousands of dollars if she was denied entry.

Marco Bello/Reuters With the United States set to host the FIFA World Cup this summer and major events lined up around the country’s 250th anniversary and the Route 66 Centennial , 2026 has the potential to reverse the negative trend line, said Mr. Hansen of the U.S. Travel Association. Initial projections from Oxford Economics , the global economic advisory firm, forecast a 3.9 percent growth in international inbound travel, a modest gain that would not recoup the decline since the start of the second Trump Administration. “Ongoing policy uncertainty and enforcement actions from the Trump administration are likely to limit gains, leaving the U.S. at risk of underperforming other international destination markets again this year,” the firm said. The World Cup is expected to draw millions of soccer fans to 11 U.S. cities this summer. Still, some members of the global soccer community, including the former FIFA president Sepp Blatter, have joined calls to boycott the event in response to violence by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Brand USA, a nonprofit destination marketing organization partially funded by the federal government, said 2026 represents a “once-in-a-generation opportunity to showcase the best of the United States.” The year’s events, “make the nation an attractive draw for global travelers, and we invite visitors to experience all this year has to offer,” Fred Dixon, the organization’s president said in an email. Headwinds in Florida With so many international tourists interested in visiting Florida, the state serves as a bellwether for foreign visitation to the United States.

Fabian Sommer/picture alliance, via Getty Images Many tourists from Canada, who traditionally flock to the state in winter, avoided it last year, according to state estimates, which show a 14.7 percent decline in Canadian visitors. WestJet, the Canadian airline has cut summer flights to U.S. destinations , including Orlando, and the Montreal-based airline Air Transat announced last week that it will stop operating flights to Florida this summer. While 2025 data for overall international travel to Florida is not yet available, the total number of visitors, including those from Mexico and Canada as well as overseas destinations, declined by 1.2 percent, falling to 12.2 million people from 12.35 million, according to data from Visit Florida, the state’s official tourism marketing corporation.

John Raoux/Associated Press But when asked about the data, the organization highlighted the growth in overseas visitors, which excludes Canada, saying they were up 4 percent from 2024 and that the group expected 2025 to be a record-breaking year for tourism. “Florida is looking forward to being a hub for travelers coming to the U.S. for the World Cup,” Bryan Griffin, the group’s president and chief executive officer said in an email. In an earnings call earlier this month, Disney warned of “international visitation headwinds” at its U.S. parks. The company declined to specify reasons for the decline. Chris French, a Florida-based Disney vacation planner, said the number of his clients looking to book international Disney destinations in Paris and Tokyo over Walt Disney World has tripled. Many of those clients, he said, are Canadian fans “who have a deep affection for the theme park, but cannot see themselves relaxing in the state of Florida right now.” Summer Outlook Image Data from online travel agencies shows a decline in July bookings for flights from Europe to the United States. Credit... Rebecca Blackwell/Associated Press While it is still early in the year, airline booking analysis from the flight data company Cirium published this month showed a 14.2 percent decline in July bookings from Europe compared to last year. The data was compiled from third-party sources and online travel agencies, between Oct. 7, 2025 and Jan. 31, 2026 and does not include flights booked directly with the airlines. Key markets, including Germany and France, are also seeing a continued decline in travel agency bookings. In January, Germany updated its travel advisory to the United States, warning of increased risks from political violence, demonstrations and immigration enforcement in cities like Minneapolis. Kerstin Heinen, a spokeswoman for the German Travel Association , said she does not know why bookings continue to decline, but that the reasons “may range from political and social factors to entry requirements and price levels.” In France, tour operator sales to United",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The United States and Indonesia announced they have signed a trade deal, with Indonesia agreeing to open its borders wider to American goods. The deal, announced on Thursday, includes zero tariffs on virtually all U.S. exports to Indonesia and a 19 percent tariff on Indonesian goods. It formalizes an agreement the two countries made last July, making Indonesia the third country in Southeast Asia to lock in lower tariffs after Malaysia and Cambodia. Mr. Trump had threatened Indonesia with a 32 percent tariff at one point last year. After seven rounds of negotiations and four trips to Washington, Indonesian officials agreed to roll back several long-prevailing trade barriers, including inspections of farm products, export restrictions on critical minerals and local content requirements. Indonesia also committed to import $15 billion worth of U.S. energy including coal, oil and gas, and $13.5 billion in American airplanes and aviation equipment. Importantly, Indonesia agreed to align with Washington on using trade policy to advance U.S. national security goals. For example, the agreement said Indonesia will restrict the export or transfer from its country of any goods that are subject to U.S. export controls, including American technology. The U.S. government has increasingly used trade rules to keep certain sensitive American products out of the hands of Chinese companies. Indonesia agreed to give American companies access to its critical mineral and oil resources to “explore, mine, extract” and export. The Indonesian government has traditionally been quite cautious of opening its natural resources sector to foreign companies. The deal with Indonesia could strengthen Mr. Trump’s hand in his trade negotiations with China ahead of his expected visit to Beijing in April. But it comes with risks for Indonesia, which like other countries in Asia counts China as its biggest trade partner. Image A bag factory in Bandung, Indonesia. Credit... Ulet Ifansasti for The New York Times The governments of Malaysia and Cambodia have been under intense scrutiny both at home and regionally since signing similar agreements to cooperate with the United States on national security issues. In Malaysia, the prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, was accused by critics of sacrificing the country’s sovereignty after he made a trade pact with Mr. Trump in October. In Cambodia, the government was criticized by China, which said it had “grave concern” about the deal. Indonesia could also risk raising the ire of China, said Deborah Elms, the head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore. “The more of these that get signed, the harder it will be for China to remain quiet,” she said, adding that so far China’s response has been relatively muted. Here’s the Latest Trump Tariffs on Countries and Products See which countries and industries are being targeted by President Trump, as he seeks to remake the global trading system. China is a main customer for the palm oil, coal and nickel that drive the Indonesian economy, and Chinese investors have sunk billions of dollars into Indonesia to build factories, rail lines and other infrastructure. So interlaced is Indonesia’s economy with China’s that when China’s growth slows by one percentage point, it causes a 0.3 percentage-point decrease in Indonesian growth, according to one estimate. The agreement with Indonesia allows Mr. Trump to claim a victory as he faces growing scrutiny at home for his immigration policies and sweeping tariffs. The Supreme Court is set to consider his sweeping use of emergency powers to enforce many of his tariffs. Indonesia’s president, Prabowo Subianto, was in Washington on Thursday for a meeting of Mr. Trump’s Board of Peace , intended to solve global conflicts. Indonesia’s military said this week that it was preparing to send thousands of troops to Gaza for a peacekeeping mission, pending approval by Mr. Prabowo. While Mr. Prabowo was in Washington, Indonesia announced what it said were $38.4 billion worth of trade and investment deals with American companies to deepen private-sector cooperation between the countries. Image A nickel mining site in Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, in 2023. Credit... Ulet Ifansasti for The New York Times Indonesia was not in a strong position to bargain over the terms of the trade deal, said Priyanka Kishore, an economist in Singapore. “Already under pressure from a flood of cheap Chinese imports, these industries are not in a position to withstand steep U.S. tariffs,” said Ms. Kishore. “By signing the U.S. deal, the Prabowo administration is effectively accepting an unfair bargain in order to stave off a wave of factory closures and manufacturing layoffs.” Muktita Suhartono contributed reporting from Bangkok.

      "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/19/business/blue-owl-stock-private-credit.html",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Shares of Blue Owl Capital, the giant private lender, plunged on Thursday after the company announced that it was changing how investors can get their money out from one of its funds, raising fresh concerns about potential problems lurking in the private credit industry. Blue Owl said investors would not be able to ask for a set amount of money back every quarter. Going forward, the firm will decide how much it will pay out quarterly. On a conference call with investors, Blue Owl executives sought to portray the changes favorably, but the announcement had the opposite effect as some investors worried that the moves could lead to obstacles to redemptions. The company’s stock ended Thursday down 6 percent, after falling as much 10 percent earlier in the day. Other companies with exposure to private credit, including Ares, Apollo and Blackstone, fell more than 5 percent. Mohamed El-Erian, a Wall Street veteran and former chief executive of PIMCO, wrote on social media that Blue Owl’s change in redemption terms reminded him of the beginnings of the financial crisis when banks sought to contain the damage from the souring mortgage loans on their books. “Is this a ‘canary-in-the-coalmine’ moment, similar to August 2007?” Mr. El-Erian wrote . In just a few years, private credit has extended trillions of dollars in loans to business, and Blue Owl, which was founded in 2016, has amassed nearly $300 billion in investor money. But the industry exists outside the traditional, highly regulated banking system, and investors can see only a limited amount of information about private credit borrowers and the terms of their loans. Blue Owl’s stock had already fallen nearly 50 percent in the past year, with investors becoming increasingly concerned about the quality of its loans and whether the company can keep growing. While there have been only a handful of private credit defaults in recent months, investors have, in recent weeks, zeroed in on potential trouble spots, such as private credit exposure to software companies at a time when software is being pressured by artificial intelligence. By many estimates, at least 20 percent of the loans extended by private credit funds have gone to software companies. Blue Owl also said on Thursday that it had sold $1.4 billion in loans from three of its funds known as business development companies . The company said it would use a portion of the proceeds — $600 million — to give money back to its investors in one of its private credit funds. Blue Owl said it was able to sell the loans at nearly 100 cents on the dollar. Many industry analysts said they were relieved that Blue Owl was able to avoid a loss. In an interview, Blue Owl’s co-president Craig Packer said the loan sale was “an unequivocal extremely positive thing for our investors,” adding that “I’m getting congratulations from everyone in our industry.” Mr. Packer also said investors were misinterpreting the new redemptions rules. On the investor call Thursday, he said the firm was “simply changing the method by which we’re providing redemptions” and would be handing investors’ money back in one of its funds quicker than they had planned. In a statement, Blue Owl said that rather than returning 5 percent to investors every quarter, it would pay 30 percent of their money “immediately.” Going forward, Blue Owl said, “our intention is to continue to return capital on an accelerated basis,” but it said it would first need to discuss the matter with its board. One buyer of the loans appeared to be Kuvare, an insurance and annuity provider that Blue Owl purchased in 2024, according to Peter Troisi, a Barclays analyst. In a research note, Mr. Troisi said that while technically the loan sale was an “arm’s-length transaction,” he expressed concerns that if private credit firms were effectively on both sides of a transaction, “it would make it more difficult to track the risk.” In the interview, Mr. Packer declined to say whether Kuvare was one of the four loan buyers and said the others included state pension plans. “This was a really thorough process involving four really high-quality institutional investors in a very tight time frame,” he said.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT In October 2006, while seeking re-election as California’s Republican governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger appeared on “The Tonight Show With Jay Leno” on NBC. It seemed innocent enough: Mr. Schwarzenegger had been a guest on Mr. Leno’s show many times, and the two Hollywood stars enjoyed a warm relationship. But Mr. Schwarzenegger’s Democratic opponent protested the appearance to the Federal Communications Commission and demanded that NBC give him 15 minutes of airtime in return, citing a rule in a decades-old communications law. The “equal time” rule requires certain broadcast shows to provide equal airtime to candidates competing for the same office. Within days, the F.C.C., then under President George W. Bush, disagreed, issuing a ruling that effectively added late-night talk show interviews to an exemption that had been awarded to news programs. That exemption stuck for two decades, even as late-night television became far more political. Now, the Trump administration has effectively removed the exemption, with the newly aggressive F.C.C. making it clear last month that it would use the rule against late-night talk show hosts, who have been among the most relentless critics of President Trump. The shift could reshape the political landscape of late-night television, where most shows overwhelmingly book Democrats over Republicans. It has also raised questions about whether a rule created in 1927 to ensure that then-powerful radio networks would not have undue influence in American elections should be applied now, when there are so many avenues for political candidates to promote themselves in a vastly expanded media landscape. The issue burst into public view this week when Stephen Colbert criticized both his network, CBS, and the F.C.C. on his show, saying CBS had barred him from interviewing James Talarico, a state lawmaker running in the Democratic Senate primary in Texas, on the air, citing the agency’s shift . Mr. Colbert said, with clear exasperation, that he had never encountered such pushback in his 21-year career as a late-night talk show host, and that he expected his network to do more to defend him. “I’m just so surprised that this giant global corporation would not stand up to these bullies,” he said. CBS disputed Mr. Colbert’s version of the events, saying it had offered him “guidance” on how he could comply with the new interpretation of the rule, including offering similar airtime to two of Mr. Talarico’s Democratic opponents. Image Brendan Carr, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, has increasingly targeted late-night programming. Credit... Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images The new interpretation is being driven by Brendan Carr, the chairman of the F.C.C., who has carried out Mr. Trump’s mission in targeting television shows that are critical of the president through the use of regulatory power . Mr. Carr’s scrutiny was also behind ABC’s decision to take “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” off the air for nearly a week last September. And this month, his agency opened an investigation of “The View” over the equal time rule. Mr. Carr’s aggressive posture toward the media has set off alarm bells about the change. Some believe his latest move could have a chilling effect on invitations for candidates to appear on late-night shows, even as this year’s midterm elections get closer. “The goal here is to intimidate broadcasters,” said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, a longtime public interest lawyer. “The message to broadcasters is: Tone it down, stay out of controversy, avoid discussing political campaigns.” Mr. Schwartzman, a veteran of major media regulatory battles, added that the networks had traditionally protested this sort of action from the F.C.C., and he said he was struck at how silent they were being now. Anna M. Gomez, the F.C.C.’s lone Democratic commissioner, said at a news conference on Wednesday that she was concerned the shift would cause networks to “self-censor.” “It’s all a part of the ultimate goal of bringing these broadcasters to heel,” she said. Mr. Carr suggested this week that he hoped the change would accomplish the opposite goal. The “whole idea here is more speech, not less — you can have more candidates on,” he said. “Congress passed the equal time provision for a very specific reason,” Mr. Carr said. “They didn’t want the media elites in Hollywood and New York to put their thumb on the scale and pick the winners and losers in primaries and general elections. That’s the whole point.” At the F.C.C., Mr. Carr has dominion over the licenses that television and radio stations need to broadcast, and that are vital to distributing the major networks’ shows nationally. He has frequently warned station owners that violations of F.C.C. policies could lead the agency to refuse to renew their licenses — a posture that has struck fear into the industry. Several major broadcasters have business before the Trump administration. CBS’s parent company, Paramount, is seeking to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, a deal that would require government approval. Broadcast licenses come with requirements that they serve the “public interest,” including several rules about how stations handle content. Cable, streaming and social media do not fall under the F.C.C. requirements, and as they rose, the rules had gone largely unenforced. But Mr. Carr has worked to revive some of them, including the equal time rule. His moves come as late night has already been facing increasing pressure from a number of directions. Ratings have fallen, advertising revenue has plummeted and viewers seem more inclined to watch video podcasts than traditional shows with a studio audience, a band and celebrity guests. Image Stephen Colbert took “The Late Show” in a more political direction after becoming its host in 2015. Credit... Daniel Cole/Reuters Mr. Colbert, a veteran of Comedy Central’s liberal late-night programming, took over “The Late Show” in 2015, as late-night hosts on every network were pushing increasingly political messages on their shows. He, too, made his program newsier, to great success: “The Late Show” eclipsed “The Tonight Show” in total viewers in 2017, and it has remained the most-watched late-night show since. Still, CBS announced last year that “The Late Show” franchise would end in May, arguing that mounting financial losses, not politics, were the only reason. After Mr. Colbert’s show goes off the air, CBS will be out of the late-night business. Mr. Kimmel, the only late-night host for ABC, has openly mused about retiring for some time. Some TV executives believe that within a few years, NBC’s “The Tonight Show” could be the only late-night show left on the broadcast networks.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The husband of Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer has been barred from the department’s headquarters after at least two female staff members told officials that he had sexually assaulted them, according to people familiar with the decision and a police report obtained by The New York Times. The women said Ms. Chavez-DeRemer’s husband, Dr. Shawn DeRemer, had touched them inappropriately at the Labor Department’s building on Constitution Avenue. One of the incidents, during working hours on the morning of Dec. 18, was recorded on office security cameras, the people said. The video showed Dr. DeRemer giving one of the women an extended embrace, and was reviewed as part of a criminal investigation, one of the people said. In January, the women’s concerns about Dr. DeRemer, 57, were raised as part of an internal investigation by the department’s inspector general into alleged misconduct by Ms. Chavez-DeRemer and her senior staff, one of the people said. On Jan. 24, Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department filed a report about forced sexual contact in December at the Labor Department, according to their report, which was viewed by The Times. The police report is the only one from the last three months associated with the Labor Department’s address, a police spokesman said, adding that the Police Department’s sexual assault unit is investigating. After the women described the incidents to investigators, Dr. DeRemer was barred from entering the Labor Department’s premises, according to people familiar with the decision, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the allegations and ongoing investigations surrounding the department. “If Mr. DeRemer attempts to enter, he is to be asked to leave,” a building restriction notice viewed by The Times said. Dr. DeRemer, an anesthesiologist in Portland, Ore., who frequently visited his wife’s Washington offices, did not respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for the Department of Labor did not provide a comment. A lawyer representing Ms. Chavez-DeRemer in the inspector general investigation declined to comment. The widening misconduct scandal at the Labor Department has forced several aides and members of the security staff in Ms. Chavez-DeRemer’s inner circle onto administrative and investigative leave . The inspector general’s office is investigating a formal complaint that Ms. Chavez-DeRemer was having an inappropriate sexual relationship with a subordinate — a member of her security detail — and abusing her office by taking staff to strip clubs, drinking alcohol on the job and taking personal trips at taxpayer expense. Her lawyer has denied the allegations. President Trump nominated Ms. Chavez-DeRemer as his labor secretary in late 2024, and she was confirmed in March last year. She was a Republican congresswoman from Oregon before losing her bid for re-election in 2024. During her tenure as labor secretary, thousands of department employees have been pushed out of the federal service. Her department has also broadcast social media messages that echoed those used by white nationalists .

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Brad Reese, the grandson of the inventor of the Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup, took to LinkedIn over the weekend to defend his family’s candy name. He wasn’t happy about a bag of Valentine’s Day Reese’s Mini Hearts, a seasonal peanut-buttery treat covered in chocolate. Except the covering was not actual milk chocolate. Hershey’s, which makes Reese’s brand candies, was using a chocolate-flavored coating that can’t legally be referred to as milk chocolate, a term that is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. “I had to actually throw it in the garbage,” he said in an interview. “That’s the first time in my life I’ve ever thrown a product of Reese’s out without consuming it.” As it turns out, it wasn’t just Valentine’s Day hearts. Reese’s foil-wrapped Peanut Butter Eggs no longer contain milk chocolate, either, The New York Times found on Thursday after an investigation that involved going to a drugstore near the office to buy a bag and read the ingredients. It’s the latest of the recipe changes that have been spreading across the candy business as prices for cocoa have climbed in recent years, driven by a confluence of factors including drought, financial speculation and labor shortages. Chocolate companies including Hershey’s have responded by replacing ingredients like cocoa butter with less-expensive substitutes. An examination of candy ingredients around Halloween last year found that Hershey’s products including Rolos, Mr. Goodbar and Almond Joy no longer listed milk chocolate among their ingredients. At that time, industry experts speculated that chocolate companies were likely to reformulate less popular products before making changes to crown jewels like the Reese’s product line. Now, some seasonal Reese’s products appear to have done away with milk chocolate, too. “I looked at the packaging, and sure enough, it was chocolate coating and also peanut butter creme, which means it’s not real peanut butter,” Mr. Reese said. “It’s all vegetable fats.” After his Valentine’s Day candy-heart discovery, Mr. Reese redesigned his personal website, which previously had been devoted to promoting peanut butter cups and his family’s history. Now, it is devoted to “protecting Reese’s brand integrity.” “I felt embarrassed to even wear anything that says Reese’s on it,” Mr. Reese said. In a statement, Hershey’s said it had made recipe adjustments to some Reese’s products “that allow us to make new shapes, sizes, and innovations.” The company said Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups were being made the same way they always have been. A package of classic Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, also examined on Thursday at the Manhattan drugstore, still listed milk chocolate and peanuts as the first two ingredients. Ingredients are listed on packaged food in descending order by weight. According to a government database last updated in late 2023, Reese’s Peanut Butter Eggs used to contain more peanuts and milk chocolate than anything else. On Thursday, a nine-ounce bag of foil-covered eggs listed sugar and vegetable oil first, and no milk chocolate. The same thing was true for Mini Hearts. Cocoa crops have been battered in recent years by longer droughts, extreme heat and irregular rainfall patterns exacerbated by climate change. Tariffs, labor issues and other geopolitical factors, along with an infection carried by mealybugs, have also hurt the business. Though prices have fallen since their peak last year, cocoa remains about twice as expensive as it was in 2022. Candy makers have responded by raising prices, shrinking packaging and quietly changing their recipes. If they remove milk chocolate from the recipe, they typically change the description on the front of the package to “chocolate candy” or “chocolatey candy.” Claire Brown covers climate change for The Times and writes for the Climate Forward newsletter.

Shortly before Mr. Gates was scheduled to deliver the speech on Thursday, the Gates Foundation issued a brief statement. “After careful consideration, and to ensure the focus remains on the AI Summit’s key priorities, Mr. Gates will not be delivering his keynote address,” the Gates Foundation announced via X. The statement did not specifically mention Mr. Epstein, but the Justice Department’s recent release of millions of pages of emails, text messages and photographs has brought renewed attention to Mr. Gates. In two newly released documents, Mr. Epstein wrote notes to himself suggesting that Mr. Gates had engaged in extramarital sex and had to acquire drugs “in order to deal with consequences of sex with Russian girls.” “These claims — from a proven, disgruntled liar — are absolutely absurd and completely false,” a representative for Mr. Gates has said of those missives. The fact that Mr. Gates and Mr. Epstein, a convicted sex offender, met on numerous occasions and worked together on a potential charitable fund has been public knowledge since shortly after Mr. Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while in custody in the Metropolitan Correctional Center. The volume of messages between Mr. Gates and his representatives and Mr. Epstein, as well as photographs of Mr. Gates released by the Justice Department with women’s faces blacked out to protect their identities, raised new questions about the depth of their ties. The Epstein files’ release has brought consequences for powerful figures enmeshed in the disgraced financier’s affairs. On Thursday, the British police arrested Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, over accusations that he shared confidential information with Mr. Epstein while serving as a British trade envoy. A former prime minister of Norway, Thorbjorn Jagland, was charged with “gross corruption” in connection with gifts, travel and loans he may have received from Mr. Epstein. The files show that Mr. Gates met Mr. Jagland, then the head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, through Mr. Epstein. To Mr. Epstein’s dismay, Mr. Gates cut off contact with him, a decision that Mr. Epstein attributed to the influence of Mr. Gates’s wife at the time, Melinda French Gates. Mr. Epstein discussed having Kathryn Ruemmler, a former Obama White House counsel, plead his case to Ms. French Gates. “She would love to sit with Melinda and give her the other side of jeffrey,” Mr. Epstein wrote in a 2017 text message included in the release. (Ms. French Gates did not speak with Ms. Ruemmler, a spokeswoman for Ms. French Gates said on Thursday.) Ms. Ruemmler recently resigned from Goldman Sachs, where she was the top legal officer, after messages emerged in which she advised Mr. Epstein on how to respond to questions about his sex crimes and addressed him as “sweetie” and “Uncle Jeffrey.” Ms. French Gates recently gave an emotional interview to NPR in which she said the latest release of files “brings back memories of some very, very painful times in my marriage.” Questions about what happened “are for those people, and for even my ex-husband,” she added. “They need to answer to those things, not me.” In an interview two weeks ago with an Australian television station, Mr. Gates said, as he had in the past, that he had met with Mr. Epstein to try to raise more money for philanthropy. “It’s factually true that I was only at dinners, you know I never went to the island, I never met any women,” Mr. Gates said, “and so the more that comes out the more clear it’ll be that although the time was a mistake it had nothing to do with that kind of behavior.” Mr. Gates has long been a popular figure in India, where his foundation has a significant presence. The India A.I. Impact Summit brought together important figures in the field as well as dignitaries like Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, President Emmanuel Macron of France and President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil. As recently as Tuesday, the foundation had confirmed Mr. Gates’s participation, saying on X that he was attending and delivering his address as scheduled.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Every tax season is a headache. Americans spend hours putting together their returns, a tedious chore that sometimes results in turning over even more money to the Internal Revenue Service. For many people, though, filing a tax return can be a financial lifeline. Tax refunds can help people catch up on bills, splurge on a vacation or simply pad their savings accounts. Those refunds are expected to be particularly significant this year. President Trump and the Republican Party passed a series of tax cuts last year that could make the average refund larger than ever. Among the changes are a new tax break for people 65 and older and the ability to deduct much more in state and local taxes. Republicans are hoping that Americans notice these tax cuts and, in return, support the G.O.P. in the fall’s midterm elections. I have spent much of the past year reporting on the creation of this tax law for The New York Times. Now I’m interested in hearing from readers about how, if at all, policies like a new tax break for overtime pay are shaping their finances. I also want to know how readers experience the tax system more generally. Have you been counting the days until you receive your tax refund? Have you been having trouble getting your tax questions answered by the I.R.S.? I’ll eagerly read every response to this questionnaire and reach back out to you if I’m interested in learning more about your situation. I won’t publish anything you submit without speaking to you. And I won’t share your contact information outside the Times newsroom or use it for any reason other than to get in touch with you. Andrew Duehren covers tax policy for The Times from Washington.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT For decades, Sandringham Estate has been a place for the House of Windsor to escape from it all. Three hours northeast of London, the palatial country house, its 20,000 sprawling acres and residences are where King Charles III and his family celebrate Christmas, waving to admirers as they parade to church services in their holiday best. Early Thursday morning, the idyllic estate was swarmed by unmarked police cars as officers arrested Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the king’s brother, amid allegations that he shared confidential government information with Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender. Later in the night, he would return to Sandringham, slinking low in the back seat of a black sport utility vehicle, with news cameras craning to capture his release. The scenes of Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor, already stripped of his title and kicked out of his longtime home, could be seen as an unmistakable message about the end of an era. Not since King Charles I was arrested and tried for treason nearly four centuries ago, in January 1649, has a British royal been detained. The king’s family, long rocked by scandalous infighting and grievous losses, is now facing what could be the gravest threat in more than a generation to its moral authority and the central role it plays, culturally and symbolically, in the country. The arrest represents the ultimate collision of police and pageantry, upending fierce efforts by Buckingham Palace to distance itself from the accusations against the former prince. The investigation into the former prince, which might continue for weeks or months, could rival royal weddings and coronations as one of the biggest public spectacles in modern British history. If charges are filed, by law and tradition, they will be formally brought in the king’s name: King Charles III v. his brother. Image At the royal family’s Sandringham Estate, in Norfolk, England, on Friday. A day before, the estate was swarmed by unmarked police cars. Credit... Justin Tallis/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The arrest follows years in which the king, and before him his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, stayed silent on separate accusations that Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor forced Virginia Giuffre to have sex with him after she was trafficked by Mr. Epstein when she was 17 years old. The former prince has denied those allegations and wrongdoing related to Mr. Epstein. “The royal family, far from dutifully serving the public in connection with this scandal that has enveloped Andrew, have not been transparent. They have not been forthcoming, secrets have persisted,” said Ed Owens, a historian and expert on Britain’s royal family. “It’s this lack of transparency that is the driving force of the moral problem at the heart of the mess for the monarchy.” The king tried on Thursday to address the simmering anger about his family’s handling of his brother’s case, issuing a statement addressed to the British people and signed simply “Charles R.,” the “R” referring to Rex, or king. In it, he vowed not to interfere in the country’s criminal justice system and pledged to assist in the investigation as needed. “What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities,” he said. “In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and cooperation.” Image On Thursday, King Charles III seemed eager to quickly move past his brother’s arrest, saying in his statement that “my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.“ Credit... Pool photo by Richard Pohle Across the globe — and especially in the United States — news of the former prince’s arrest underscored the striking lack of similar actions against people connected to Mr. Epstein despite the public disclosure of millions of pages of correspondence documenting his actions and communications with wealthy and connected elites. In the United States, only Ghislaine Maxwell, Mr. Epstein’s longtime associate, was convicted, of sex trafficking for conspiring to exploit underage girls. Mr. Epstein was arrested and charged, but died in prison while awaiting trial. After the former prince’s arrest on Thursday, a statement from the family of Ms. Giuffre, who killed herself last year, started with just two words: “At last.” And yet, the investigation into Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor does not focus on the accusations of sexual assault leveled against him during the past decade. Police are looking into whether Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor committed misconduct in public office while he served as a British trade envoy, amid reports that information was shared with Mr. Epstein. In Britain, the arrest felt like the culmination of a decade-long drama that has chipped away at the royal family’s stature, bit by bit. For years, the former prince’s links to Mr. Epstein plagued members of the royal family, even as they navigated the uncertainty of some of the most significant moments in British history. The death of Queen Elizabeth in 2022. The coronation of her son King Charles III. The very public defection of Harry, the Duke of Sussex, to the United States. The period of intense scrutiny began in 2010, when Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor was spotted walking with Mr. Epstein in New York, two years after the financier’s conviction for soliciting an underage girl for prostitution. The former prince later said he had arranged the meeting to end the friendship with Mr. Epstein and that he wanted do so in person. Correspondence from the recently released Epstein files in Washington show that he still maintained contact with Mr. Epstein. In 2011, a British newspaper published a now-infamous photo of Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor with his arm around Ms. Giuffre’s waist when she was 17. The scrutiny intensified when Ms. Giuffre alleged in a 2015 lawsuit that she was trafficked by Mr. Epstein and forced by Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor to have sex several times, in three different cities. Four years later, after Mr. Epstein was arrested and later died by suicide, Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor tried to reclaim his reputation. He sat for an interview on BBC’s Newsnight program , where he claimed he had no recollection of the photo with Ms. Giuffre. Image An undated image made available by the U.S. District Court of Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor with Virginia Giuffre, center, and Ghislaine Maxwell. Credit... U.S. District Court, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Nervous and evasive, the interview backfired. Viewers said they were shocked at his lack of sympathy for Ms. Giuffre and did not believe his denials of sexual misconduct. He tried to refute her allegation that they had sweated on a dance floor by claiming he was medically unable to perspire. In the fallout from the interview, the former prince agreed to step back from some royal duties and, in 2021, settled a lawsuit with Ms. Giuffre, the details of which were sealed. Even then, the royal family remained silent, keeping the royal status quo for Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor. He was finally stripped of his royal titles and royal residence last year, after Ms. Giuffre’s memoir revealed new details about her allegations. The latest release of Epstein files seemed to suddenly plunge him, and the royal family, into new territory, as the prospect of a criminal investigation into misconduct in public office emerged. On Thursday, King Charles seemed eager to quickly move past his brother’s arrest, saying in his statement that “my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.” Hours later, the king appeared in the front row of a London fashion show while his wife, Queen Camilla, attended a lunchtime orchestral concert. But the fallout is likely to continue for some time and could easily reach into the next royal generation, experts say. The king is receiving treatment for a cancer diagnosis and his heir, Prince William, said in his first comments on the case last week tha",

Darya said a drunken Russian soldier had forced his hands into her underwear and shouted “I want a young body!” Credit... Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 9:52 min Learn more Share full article Photographs by Lynsey Addario Written by Sara Cincurova Feb. 20, 2026 Hundreds of Ukrainian women and girls have reported sexual violence by Russian troops during the nearly four years of full-scale war in Ukraine, according to Ukrainian authorities and aid groups. The actual number of victims, advocates say, is most likely far higher. Some of the women say they have been impregnated by Russian soldiers and live with children who will forever remind them of their attackers. Others have told of being forced to serve as sex slaves for entire companies of Russian troops. Still others say their life became a waking nightmare after they were incapacitated and raped by Russian forces. The New York Times spoke with more than a dozen women who said they had been sexually abused by Russian troops. Most of the women asked that their full identities be withheld to protect their privacy. Although details of their claims could not be independently verified, The Times reviewed criminal complaints and medical records related to many of their cases, and spoke with advocates familiar with the women’s accounts. Nina says she tested positive for hepatitis C after being beaten and raped by a Russian soldier in her home. Yuliia says Russian prison guards tied her naked to a table and threatened to violate her with a rubber stick after she was arrested in 2021 in a part of Ukraine occupied by Russia. Olha says she was stripped, groped and forced to use the toilet naked in front of Russian soldiers. The Kremlin has said that many reports by Ukrainian women of sexual violence were groundless. It did not respond to a request for comment. For Ukraine, the sexual violence is a largely hidden trauma. Advocates say many women are reluctant to file cases because they want to avoid stigma and painful memories, or because they live in territory that remains occupied by Russia and have little hope of legal redress. Some women have broken the cycle of silence, helped by survivor groups, or motivated to shed light on what they call atrocities that Russia has used as a weapon of war. Here are some of their stories. Lesya: ‘I thought that was it for me.’ Image Lesya beside her car in the Kyiv region. She said it was defaced by Russian soldiers after she was raped and her husband was killed. On March 7, 2022, two weeks into Russia’s invasion, Lesya, a 53-year-old economist, and her husband, Sasha, heard a knock on their door, in a village near Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. Two Russian soldiers burst in, she said. One of them caught her and dragged her into a neighbor’s house, she recalled. “He raped me straight away,” Lesya said. “The second one shot my husband in the stomach and leg while I was being raped.” Four other Russian soldiers approached the house where she was being violated, she said. “I thought that was it for me — they had knives, rifles and grenades,” Lesya recalled. But the soldiers stopped her attacker and pulled him away, she said. She then searched for her husband, she said. She found him bleeding on the floor of another house. Neighbors were attempting first aid. Lesya begged the Russian troops to allow her to drive her husband to the hospital, she said, but they would not let her get in her car. Sasha died in Lesya’s arms two days after he was shot, she said. One of his last utterances was “Thank God my father didn’t live to see this,” Lesya recalled, devastated at the memory. A doctor who investigated her husband’s death confirmed that he had died from gunshots to the abdomen during the Russian occupation. Lesya filed a complaint with the prosecutor general’s office accusing the Russian forces of rape, and criminal proceedings have begun. Her husband’s death, she said, was worse than the rape. She still lives in their house. Her car was stolen, then returned after Ukrainian soldiers pushed the Russian Army out of the Kyiv region. It had been marked with a “V,” a symbol Russia has used in the war. She has not driven it since. Svitlana: ‘I wanted to get an abortion.’ Image Svitlana holding her 2-year-old son, who she said was born out of rape by a Russian soldier. Svitlana, 31, was already worried about her 4-week-old son, who had been born in fragile health and had lost access to medical care after the Russian Army invaded her village in southern Ukraine. Then, Russian soldiers stormed her home and threatened to kidnap the boy and take him to Russia, she said. She intervened and they relented, she said. But even after that frightening encounter in March 2022, her partner, the baby’s father, began to befriend the troops. The father, a Russian sympathizer, invited them frequently into their home and drank with them, she said. One day, as the men gathered, her partner forced her into a white van with two soldiers, she said. The soldiers put a mask over her face, she said, and drove her to a nearby village. Svitlana’s partner stayed in the van while one of the soldiers forced her into a shop and raped her twice, she said. The soldiers “had a grenade, a knife and a rifle,” she recalled. Afterward, Svitlana’s partner accompanied her back to their house without saying a word, she said. Six months later, Svitlana fled to another village with her baby and four other children from previous relationships. She and her partner had split up. But Svitlana soon noticed that her stomach was growing. A pregnancy test came back positive. “I wanted to get an abortion,” she recalled. “I went to the hospital, but they said it was too late. I was 23 weeks pregnant.” Svitlana’s baby boy, Yaroslav, was born on March 8, 2023. The regional prosecutor’s office said that it was investigating the case and that it had received a report from a gynecologist who treated Svitlana. The child looks like the rapist, she said. She is seeing psychologists to help her come to terms with her situation. Today, “Yaroslav is developing faster than my other children. He already speaks fluently,” Svitlana said. “Sometimes, I regret that I wanted the abortion. I love him almost like the others.” Tetiana: ‘It was the worst of all the prisons.’ Image Tetiana Tipakova, who vocally opposed Russia’s invasion, said she was tortured by Russian soldiers for a week. When Russian troops occupied the city of Berdyansk in southeastern Ukraine on the night of Feb. 26, 2022, Tetiana Tipakova decided to resist. Ms. Tipakova, 53, a former student leader and an entrepreneur, wrapped herself in a Ukrainian flag and organized anti-Russian protests. She delivered speeches in front of City Hall and recorded videos for social media. Less than a month later, Ms. Tipakova said, Russian troops grabbed her inside her home. Eight armed men in balaclavas handcuffed her, put a bag over her head and drove her to a prison colony, she said. “I knew that place — it was the worst of all the prisons” in Berdyansk, she said. There, she was tortured for seven days, she said. On the fourth day, she said, she was driven to grounds outside the prison where guards had set up a mock execution by firing squad. While detained, Ms. Tipakova was subjected to psychologically and physically abusive interrogations, as well as beatings and electric shocks. After “the electric current ran through my body,” she said, she started “constantly smelling burning hair.” She said she was sexually assaulted by prison guards who violated her with their hands and with objects such as firearms. The goal of the torture, she said, was to break her mentally and to silence her, as well as to force her to spread Russian propaganda in Berdyansk. The abuse continued, she said, until she agreed to film a social media video acknowledging that anti-Russian protests were a mistake. She was released and then fle",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Cuba is confronting the United States’ first effective blockade since the Cuban Missile Crisis and running out of fuel fast, pushing the nation toward a humanitarian crisis and its government to the edge of collapse , according to a New York Times analysis of shipping data and satellite images. Cuban tankers have hardly left the island’s shores for months. Oil-rich allies have halted shipments or declined to come to the rescue. The U.S. military has seized ships that have supported Cuba . And in recent days, vessels roaming the Caribbean Sea in search of fuel for Cuba have come up empty or been intercepted by the U.S. authorities. Last week, a tanker linked to Cuba burned fuel for five days to get to the port in Curaçao but then left without cargo, according to ship-tracking data. Three days later, the U.S. Coast Guard intercepted a tanker full of Colombian fuel oil en route to Cuba that had gotten within 70 miles of the island, the data showed. While President Trump has pledged to halt any oil headed to Cuba, the Trump administration has stopped short of calling its policy a blockade. But it is functioning as one. Mr. Trump signed an executive order last month threatening to impose tariffs on countries that provide oil to Cuba. That has succeeded at scaring other nations, like Mexico , into sitting on the sidelines despite their desire to help Cuba. At the same time, the largest U.S. military presence in the Caribbean in decades is policing the waters around the island, fresh off its work blocking oil shipments to and from Venezuela ahead of the U.S. capture of the country’s leader, Nicolás Maduro, last month. And, according to a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters, the Coast Guard’s interception of the tanker headed to Cuba last week was part of a blockade that the Trump administration has not yet announced. “Among us longtime Cuba watchers, we’ve always resisted people using the word blockade,” said Fulton Armstrong, the former lead Latin America analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency, who has been studying Cuba since 1984. “But it is indeed a blockade.” The White House declined to comment. A Cuban government spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. The United Nations has criticized the U.S. policy as a violation of international law that has exacerbated the suffering of Cuba’s roughly 10 million residents. It also appears to have the island’s Communist government teetering on edge. Image A street in Havana earlier this week. Trash is piling up, food prices are soaring, schools are canceling classes and hospitals are suspending surgeries in Cuba. Credit... Yamil Lage/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images “Since the Cuban Missile Crisis, this is the biggest step,” Mr. Armstrong said, referring to the 13-day confrontation in 1962 when the U.S. Navy encircled Cuba . “And the Cubans will have to make a decision of whether to surrender.” The U.S. government called its 1962 policy a “quarantine” to avoid using the word “blockade ,” which legally could be interpreted as an act of war. The Trump administration has also avoided using the word “blockade.” President Miguel Díaz-Canel of Cuba has said he was open to negotiating with Washington, while promising to find ways around the blockade. “We are making every effort so that the country can once again have fuel,” he told reporters this month. “We have to do very hard, very creative and very intelligent work to overcome all these obstacles.” To understand whether fuel was still flowing to the island, The Times conducted interviews and analyzed satellite images, port records and data broadcast from a series of ships connected to Cuba. The analysis showed that oil-tanker traffic to and from the island has nearly stopped. Yet it also showed that several ships did appear to venture out in search of fuel. All were stymied by Mr. Trump’s policies. The Ocean Mariner On Jan. 29, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency, claiming that Cuba is a hotbed for spies and terrorists and threatening tariffs against any nation that provides petroleum products to the island. On the same day, a tanker called the Ocean Mariner docked at a port in Barranquilla, Colombia, according to data broadcast by the boat and satellite imagery. It loaded 84,579 barrels of fuel oil, according to Kpler, a shipping data firm. The Ocean Mariner has been a regular carrier of oil to Cuba, even delivering the island’s last shipment, from Mexico, on Jan. 9. But when it left Colombia, it broadcast its destination as the Dominican Republic. Twelve days later, on Feb. 10, it changed course toward Cuba. Jan. 15 Haiti Venezuela Colombia D.R. P.R. Florida Costa Rica Jamaica Panama Cuba Nicaragua Honduras Caribbean Sea Bahamas Leaves Cuba Loads oil in Colombia Loiters off the Dominican coast Heads to Cuba, turns around Being escorted to the Bahamas On Feb. 11, just 65 miles from Cuba, the Ocean Mariner abruptly made a U-turn, according to ship-tracking data. It appeared to have realized it was being pursued. The next day, a U.S. Coast Guard vessel pulled up alongside the tanker, according to the data. The Coast Guard crew asked the Ocean Mariner where it was headed, and the tanker reported it was destined for the Dominican Republic, despite the fact that it was way off course, according to a U.S. official who was briefed on the episode. The Coast Guard then sailed alongside the Ocean Mariner for nearly two days, escorting it into Dominican waters, the data show. The ship remained there, full of fuel, for several days. On Thursday, a Coast Guard vessel again began escorting the Ocean Mariner — this time north toward the Bahamas, which the Ocean Mariner broadcast as its destination. When U.S. vessels were seizing Venezuelan oil tankers late last year, those ships also brought their oil to the Bahamas. Growing Isolation In Cuba, people are struggling with frequent blackouts, shortages of gasoline and cooking gas and dwindling supplies of diesel that power the nation’s water pumps. Trash is piling up, food prices are soaring, schools are canceling classes and hospitals are suspending surgeries. Some humanitarian aid is still arriving in the country, including from the United States. The U.S. government said this month it would send $6 million in aid to Cuba, including prepackaged food, via the Catholic Church. Still, the U.S. embargo on Cuba has deeply complicated life for its residents for more than six decades, and now the blockade of oil tankers is plunging the island into one of its darkest moments. Jorge Piñón, a former oil executive who runs a team at the University of Texas at Austin tracking Cuba’s oil, said the team estimates that the country’s fuel reserves could be depleted by mid-March, triggering social unrest that could threaten the government. Nearly all of Cuba’s energy runs on oil and oil products . And Cuba appears to have few lifelines left . Its once dominant supplier, Venezuela, is now effectively controlled by the United States. Russia recently promised to send oil but its ships are nowhere to be seen. And other oil-exporting countries friendly to Cuba are staying away, Mr. Piñón said, including Brazil, Angola and Algeria. “All of these countries have their own problems,” he said. “Why antagonize the White House?” After Washington took control of Venezuela’s oil, Mexico was left as Cuba’s primary provider. But after Mr. Trump threatened tariffs, it halted its shipments. Mexico is economically dependent on the United States and locked in negotiations with Washington over an expiring trade deal . President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico has tried to walk a fine line, sending humanitarian aid packages to Cuba, offering to mediate talks and saying: “You cannot suffocate a people like this.” The Gas Exelero The Times analysis suggests that in the absence of its typical suppliers, Cuba has begun looking to some of its smaller neighbors in the Carib",

For Mr. Lou, these differences are mostly semantic. “The distinction we draw between feature films and documentaries is a mistake,” Mr. Lou, 60, said in an interview at his studio in Beijing, not long after the film, “Re-TROS ‘After the Applause,’” made its premiere in the city last fall. “As long as there’s a camera pointed at you, reality has already subtly changed,” he said. A resistance to clear lines or categories runs through Mr. Lou’s work — and his life. His shaky, hand-held camerawork evokes realism, but the stories are often dreamlike or fantastical. The films start with real moments in Chinese history but feature mysterious look-alikes and stories within stories. He is best known for his clashes with Chinese censors, who have barred about half of his films from screening in the country. (He is sometimes compared to Jafar Panahi , the Iranian director who has been jailed for his films.) But Mr. Lou has also made movies released widely in Chinese theaters, featuring big budgets and even bigger stars, sometimes while battling censors on another film at the same time. Some Chinese filmmakers defy censorship early in their careers, then shift solidly into the mainstream; others remain on the fringes. Few have moved so continuously between the two. “Is that a good thing or a bad thing?” Mr. Lou said, when asked about that feat.

Andrea Verdelli for The New York Times While his films have been honored at Cannes and Venice, he said he wanted most to reach a Chinese audience, who would be most likely to understand them. He has accepted significant cuts to some films to see them released domestically. (The concert film is awaiting approval for wider release.) Mr. Lou’s wife and frequent screenwriter, Ma Yingli, said in an interview that they tried not to think about censorship until submitting a movie for review. “If you do that, you’ll never be able to make a film,” she said. “If problems arise later, you can try to find solutions,” she added, such as cuts or edits. But some topics felt so urgent, Mr. Lou said, that he would not have been able to continue making films if he had not addressed them. That was true of “Summer Palace,” his 2006 film about disillusioned lovers after the Tiananmen massacre, because of his experience as a student during the demonstrations. It was also true of “ An Unfinished Film ,” a metafictional look at filmmaking under lockdown, because he felt the pandemic had redefined the relationship between people, screens and reality.

Andrea Verdelli for The New York Times “Generally speaking, if you don’t violate an artist’s basic expression, I think restrictions and obstacles are quite normal,” he said. “But if you push past that point, the artist may push back.” He described this reaction as reflexive, out of his control. “That’s not about cinema anymore,” he said. Mr. Lou was born in Shanghai, to an actor and an acting teacher. At age 20, in 1985, he enrolled at the Beijing Film Academy to study directing. It was a time of heady experimentation, as China’s leaders loosened their grip on the economy and, cautiously, culture. The graduates from the academy in those years later became known as the pioneers of Chinese underground cinema. They made low-budget films documenting the unglamorous side of China’s boom and did not submit them to the state film administration, meaning they could not enter theaters. Mr. Lou’s breakout film was “Suzhou River” in 2000, a noirish tale of a man searching for his lost lover in a seedy, industrial Shanghai. It was Mr. Lou’s first encounter with international acclaim, winning a prize at the Rotterdam film festival, but also his first major run-in with the authorities. Because he had not obtained officials’ permission to submit the film to the festival, they banned him from making movies for two years. “Summer Palace,” the 2006 Tiananmen movie, earned him another five-year ban on filmmaking. He shot his next film, “Spring Fever,” in secret. A gay romance, it was released in 2009. In recent years, Mr. Lou has also made films marketed more at mass audiences, such as “ Saturday Fiction ,” a World War II spy story starring the Chinese superstar Gong Li. But even those films deploy techniques that may put off casual moviegoers, like jump cuts and subtle social commentary, said Sheldon Lu , a scholar of Chinese cinema at the University of California, Davis. Image Posters of “Suzhou River” and “Spring Fever,” other movies that Mr. Lou directed. Credit... Andrea Verdelli for The New York Times Many of Mr. Lou’s classmates at the Beijing Film Academy are now among China’s most successful directors, in part because they have embraced mainstream or even nationalistic filmmaking, such as odes to the Chinese military, Professor Lu said. But Mr. Lou “holds onto his principles, his aesthetics.” Indeed, after “Saturday Fiction” was widely promoted in Chinese state media, Mr. Lou again broached a Chinese government taboo: pandemic lockdowns, in “An Unfinished Film.” Released abroad in 2024, it is unavailable in China. Despite his maverick image, Mr. Lou is a restrained presence. A self-proclaimed introvert, he has worked with the same actors for many of his films, in part, he joked, because he is uncomfortable meeting new people. But he sometimes shows flashes of childlike delight — or defiance. While Mr. Lou was making “The Shadow Play,” a film about corruption during China’s economic opening, Ms. Ma shot a behind-the-scenes documentary. In one scene, Mr. Lou grins widely after capturing a shot he likes and mimics the sound of an explosion. But later in the documentary, when censors demand extensive cuts to “The Shadow Play,” Mr. Lou declares that he would rather it never be released. A member of his team fires back, “Do the rest of us eat?” After two years of negotiations with officials, the movie was released in China in 2019. At the premiere, Mr. Lou tersely told the audience that he had left in signs of deletions and changes, as proof of the censors’ interference: “These are all things I want the audience to be aware of.” Mr. Lou said “The Shadow Play” was probably the film on which he had made the most compromises. Still, he said it was worthwhile to give Chinese moviegoers a record of their collective experience, even if it could be only a “second-rate” version, as Mr. Lou once described it, because of censorship. His willingness to negotiate may also speak to his desire for audiences, both at home and overseas, to talk about something other than censorship.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT When a South Korean court sentenced a former president to life imprisonment this week, convicting him of masterminding an insurrection, it immediately removed one cloud hanging over the country’s current leader, Lee Jae Myung. Anything less than ​a conviction ​would have been a political disaster for Mr. Lee, who was a political opponent of his convicted predecessor, Yoon Suk Yeol. If Mr. Yoon had been cleared of​ the insurrection charge, he and his hard-right followers would have challenged the legitimacy of the impeachment — and by extension, ​Mr. Lee’s election, which it had made possible. Instead, the court’s ruling on Thursday lightens the ​political burden on Mr. Lee by justifying ​the impeachment​, which his party​ spearheaded. It also brings South Korea a sense of closure to the political turmoil and restores a measure of trust in the system.​​ Almost certainly, Mr. Lee will have a freer hand as he tries to move beyond the drama and toward other priorities. His party already has a majority in the National Assembly, the country’s parliament. ​About 60 percent of the South Koreans approve of his performance as president, according to surveys. If his party wins a landslide victory in the June elections of city mayors and provincial governors, as many analysts predict, it will make Mr. Lee more confident in pushing his domestic agenda, ​like curbing housing prices.​ But Mr. Lee’s toughest challenge remains how to heal the ​social fracture in his nation, deepened by political tribalism and differences over ties with North Korea and China, that was exposed by Mr. Yoon’s abrupt martial law declaration in December 2024. “Now that the legal judgment has come down on who’s right and wrong about Yoon’s martial law, it’s time for Lee to leave behind political strife and push more confidently for national unity,” said Kang Won-taek, a professor of political science at Seoul National University​. With or without Mr. Lee’s efforts, political polarization is still intense, fueled by hyper-partisanship, internet-generated disinformation and the rise of a far-right movement. Outside the courthouse on Thursday, rival camps shouted “death” for Mr. Yoon and “prison” for Mr. Lee. Image Supporters of former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol gathered outside the Seoul Central District Court on Thursday. Credit... Ahn Young-Joon/Associated Press Mr. Lee has vowed to heal the divided country and not to indulge in political revenge. But he also promised to “eliminate the insurrection forces,” whom his supporters cast as enemies of democracy. Mr. Yoon’s guilty verdict could dim the prospects for a small yet persistent army of Yoon supporters who have been rallying in downtown Seoul, calling for his reinstatement, however unrealistic that may be, some analysts said. But others warned it could aggravate the political polarization. In a message released to his followers through his lawyers on Friday, Mr. Yoon called himself a victim of “political revenge” and said, “Our fight is not over.” Jang Dong-hyeok, the leader of Mr. Yoon’s former bloc, the People Power Party, on Friday expressed “sadness” at Mr. Yoon’s conviction. He refused to cut ties with him or his followers, and it is still unclear what path the party will take in regards to Mr. Yoon’s outraged supporter base. “Yoon’s far-right followers will become angrier and more vindictive,” said Choi Jin, director of the Institute for Presidential Leadership in Seoul. “The People Power Party, in order to compensate for its weakened position, will likely escalate an all-consuming political offensive against President Lee.” Mr. Lee must reckon with the hard-liners within his own party, as well. They were angry that Mr. Yoon had escaped the death penalty they had demanded. And they vowed to enact a new law curtailing the president’s right to pardon criminals convicted of treason or insurrection — a potentially potent political tool that has fallen into Mr. Lee’s hands. Mr. Lee has been silent on Mr. Yoon’s conviction except for his call on the military on Friday to “eliminate the remnants of the illegal martial law,” a reference to officers who may have supported Mr. Yoon. Moving ahead, Mr. Lee is likely to push harder on his domestic agenda. He has sought punitive measures against news outlets for spreading what he characterizes as malicious falsehoods. He wants South Koreans to concentrate less of their wealth in real-estate and more in stocks, and wants to change real estate taxes to make homes more affordable, especially for the newly married. Mr. Lee’s government has also launched investigations into Protestant churches — long a powerful force in Korean politics, and a major source of support for his predecessor — to cut what he has condemned as corrupt ties between churches and politicians. Mr. Lee has proved pragmatic in negotiating a trade deal with the Trump administration and managing relations with his country’s neighbors, China and Japan. Despite repeated snubs from North Korea, he is trying to rebuild trust with the North, taking unilateral measures to ease tensions along the border. But the success of his policy endeavors will depend on whether he can learn lessons from Mr. Yoon’s downfall and appear as more of a uniter. “It’s the president who holds the key to building a cooperative relationship with the opposition,” Mr. Choi said.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The British police on Friday were searching a mansion occupied until recently by Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former prince, a day after his stunning arrest over links to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor was questioned until late Thursday at a police station in Norfolk over allegations of misconduct in public life. A photograph of him leaving the building, looking shellshocked in the back of a vehicle, dominated the front pages of British newspapers on Friday. The arrest plunged the British monarchy into one of its biggest crises in decades. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor, who turned 66 on Thursday, was formerly known as Prince Andrew and is a younger brother of King Charles III. His arrest came after the United States Department of Justice released millions of documents last month in connection with Mr. Epstein. Reports based on those documents suggest that Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor may have shared confidential government information with Mr. Epstein while serving as a British trade envoy, a position he held from 2001 to 2011. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor has not so far been charged. The British police did not mention the accusations of sexual abuse made against the former prince by Virginia Roberts Giuffre , who died by suicide last year, nor the trafficking allegations that Mr. Epstein was facing when he died in a Manhattan jail in 2019. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor, who has not spoken publicly or responded to requests for comment in recent months, has always denied any wrongdoing. Image Police officers at the entrance of Royal Lodge, a property on the estate surrounding Windsor Castle and a former residence of Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor, on Friday. Credit... Jaimi Joy/Reuters The police search underway on Friday was at Royal Lodge, a 30-room mansion on the estate surrounding Windsor Castle that the former prince occupied until earlier this year, when he moved to a smaller property on the royal estate in Sandringham, Norfolk. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor used an office in Buckingham Palace while working as a trade envoy, raising the possibility that it, too, might be subject to some form of police search. The British police have said nothing about the specifics of the investigation. Misconduct in public office takes place when someone performing a job on behalf of the British public “willfully neglects to perform their duty” or “willfully misconducts themselves” in abuse of the public trust. Theoretically, it carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. While other members of the royal family have continued their normal round of engagements, the allegations swirling around Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor have created an extraordinary moment of jeopardy for the monarchy, which has been shaken by several crises over the last century. Until Thursday, no senior royal family member had been arrested in connection with a serious crime since the 17th century. Charles issued a public statement after the arrest promising full cooperation with the investigation and stating that “the law must take its course.” On Thursday, Sky Roberts, Ms. Giuffre’s brother, praised the British authorities, contrasting what had taken place in Britain with what he described as inaction in the United States. “I will continue to commend the king for the actions he has taken, we have yet to see that from our own government here,” he said in a BBC interview. Amanda Roberts, Ms. Giuffre’s sister-in-law, added in that interview: “We are hopeful that this investigation now starts to open up that further probe into the sexual assault allegations.” Image Sky Roberts, the brother of Virginia Giuffre, and his wife Amanda, right, in Washington earlier this month. Credit... J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press In 2022, Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor paid Ms. Giuffre an undisclosed sum to settle a lawsuit in a New York court, in which she accused him of raping her when she was 17. He did not admit any wrongdoing in the case. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor was stripped of his royal title and honors last year after earlier revelations from the Epstein files. But he remains eighth in line to the throne and, while it seems unlikely that Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor could ever become king, some politicians are pressing for his right to succession to be revoked formally. That would require legislation in Parliament, a process that could expose the monarchy to more scrutiny. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor has said that he first met Mr. Epstein in 1999 through Ghislaine Maxwell, then the financier’s girlfriend and a well-connected Briton and daughter of the media tycoon Robert Maxwell. In 2008, Mr. Epstein was jailed after pleading guilty in Florida to a charge of soliciting a minor for prostitution. Two years later, Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor and Mr. Epstein were photographed walking in Central Park in New York City. The former prince later claimed that the meeting was to end the friendship and that he wanted to do so in person.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Almost as soon as an edict came out barring all female government employees in one Syrian province from wearing makeup, so too did the memes. They mocked the genetic curse of facial hair among Syrian women, saying they would now be indistinguishable from their male colleagues. Sultana Fawaz, a Syrian influencer, jokingly suggested that between the makeup ban and power cuts that have rendered women unable to style their hair, it was a plot by the government — led by conservative Muslims — to get women to cover their hair and faces. “Makeup is a red line,” Ms. Fawaz said with a chuckle in a video posted on social media. “Men should come out in protest, not women.” Joking aside, the decision by the governor of Latakia province struck fear among Syrians who are wary of the national government dominated by Islamist former rebels. Women in particular have wondered whether the central government would eventually try to institute religious laws in a country with a diverse array of religious and ethnic minorities. The Latakia governor, Muhammad Othman, decreed last month that female employees in state and local administrations and institutions in the province, including schools, should refrain from wearing makeup during official working hours or face “legal accountability.” Around the same time that the order came out, a local government in a suburb of the capital, Damascus, barred men from working in women’s shops — compounding the fears among some that the country would tilt in a more conservative direction. President Ahmed al-Sharaa has not done much to fan those fears. But there are concerns about the actions of individuals within the government, whether it’s changing school curriculums or security officers confiscating musical instruments or alcohol at the border. Mr. Othman, the Latakia governor, was appointed by the central government. Some have also questioned the timing and prioritization of seemingly trivial matters when Syria is still in the midst of tremendous political change, economic suffering and formidable security challenges. “Honestly, we really thought it was a joke because we’re not used to such a decision,” said Lina Ismael, 48, a media coordinator in the health department in Latakia, a province along Syria’s Mediterranean coast. Like others interviewed, she viewed makeup as a matter of personal freedom but favored reasonable limits on heavy makeup. Margarite Jamal, a lawyer in Latakia who spends much of her time at the courthouse, said she welcomed the decision, seeing it as an attempt to professionalize the appearance of civil sector employees. “Frankly, in the last 10 years, professional standards have declined significantly,” she said. “Many working women now go to work dressed the same way they would to a wedding, which is completely unacceptable and gives a baffling impression of working women.” A 41-year-old journalist who works for Syrian state television said she didn’t believe the decision when she first heard it. The woman, who asked not to be identified for fear of professional repercussions, said she herself sometimes wears makeup to work and other times will come with messy hair and an unwashed face, depending on her mood. She rejected the governor’s edict as a matter of personal freedom and a violation of women’s rights. After widespread condemnation of the decision, the journalist said she didn’t expect it to be strictly enforced. Weeks after the order was announced, several women interviewed said the ban was not yet being enforced. It remains unclear when or how it will be implemented and whether it will face legal challenges. Image Syrians protesting changes to the public-school curriculum in the capital, Damascus, last year. Credit... David Guttenfelder/The New York Times The Latakia governor declined repeated requests for an interview, but in a follow-up statement, his office sought to calm reaction to his decision. The edict “does not aim to restrict any group or infringe upon personal freedoms, which are safeguarded by the constitutional declaration and protected by law,” it said. The governor’s statement said the decision was about regulating professional appearance and avoiding excessive use of makeup in government and public sector jobs. There are a number of problems with the decision, said Dima Moussa, a lawyer, politician and feminist activist. For one, the law and constitution prohibit discrimination based on gender and the ban also infringes on personal freedoms, she said. More pressing for many Syrians was the political backdrop against which the decision was made. A ban on makeup is “viewed through the lens of the background of those making these decisions,” Ms. Moussa said. “Until now there is nothing that shows that their intent is to make the country Islamic,” she said of the government. “But there is always fear,” she added. “The good thing is that when decisions like this are made, the reaction, time and again, shows them that the Syrian people don’t accept this,” Ms. Moussa said. Even though Syrians generally are socially conservative, no matter their religion, they still reject such restrictions, she added. “People don’t want anyone to restrict their freedoms, tell them what to wear or not to wear, tell them how they should look, tell them if they can drink alcohol or not,” she said.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Japan’s shopping districts, restaurants, temples and ski resorts would normally be teeming with Chinese tourists right now as they celebrate the Lunar New Year holiday. Instead, in cities like Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto, business owners say visitors from China have been scarcer this year. The Chinese government, drawing on falsehoods and exaggerations, is aggressively discouraging its citizens from visiting Japan as part of a campaign to punish Tokyo for its support for Taiwan , a self-governing democracy that Beijing considers part of its territory. In recent government statements and state media commentaries , Beijing has portrayed Japan as a land where people live under the constant threat of earthquakes, crime, traffic accidents and attacks by bears — and where Chinese travelers, in particular, are targeted. “Chinese citizens face serious security threats in Japan,” China’s foreign ministry said ahead of this week’s Lunar New Year holiday, China’s peak travel season. Beijing’s strategy of undermining Japan’s image in China as one of the world’s safest travel destinations may be working. The number of Chinese travelers to Japan has sharply declined in recent months, falling 61 percent in January from a year earlier (though the data is somewhat skewed by the timing of the Lunar New Year, which began in January last year and in February this year). Arrivals had fallen 45 percent in December. Here’s a look at Beijing’s claims. Earthquakes China has repeatedly pointed to the frequency of earthquakes in Japan to deter travel there. In December, after a powerful earthquake in northern Japan, the Chinese foreign ministry said people should avoid the country because of the risk of a tsunami or a so-called mega quake. Yes, Japan sits along the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” a chain of seismologically active faults encircling the Pacific Ocean, making it one of the world’s most earthquake-prone countries. But Japan is also a global leader in dealing with earthquakes, with early warning systems and strict construction standards. By seizing on earthquakes, analysts said, the Chinese government is attempting to signal that its central concern is safety — not politics. In these warnings, the government rarely mentions its fierce opposition to Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s stance that Japan could help defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion. “A safety narrative feels more neutral and reversible, giving the Chinese government room to signal displeasure while keeping diplomatic flexibility,” said Xiao Qiang, a specialist in Chinese propaganda at the University of California, Berkeley. Targeting of Chinese Citizens China has argued that its citizens risk being targeted in Japan, tapping into a longstanding nationalist narrative rooted in the two countries’ bitter World War II history and Japan’s record of wartime atrocities . China has highlighted attacks on its citizens, including an incident reported by Japanese media this week in which a man attacked a Hong Kong resident on the head with a beer bottle in the northern city of Sapporo. China has also said, without providing specifics, that there have been cases of “unprovoked verbal abuse and physical assault” against its citizens in Japan. There is no evidence of a surge in crime or discrimination against Chinese citizens in Japan. In fact, the number of murders, robberies and arsons involving Chinese victims has declined over the past several years, according to official Japanese statistics. China’s attempts to heighten a sense of prejudice might resonate domestically because of the emotions people still feel about World War II, said Kurt Tong, a managing partner at the Asia Group and former American diplomat. “These emotional, interpersonal arguments could have more resonance with the Chinese public,” he said. “It plays into the nationalist idea that they’re being disrespected as a people.” Crime, Accidents and Bears Japan has one of the lowest crime rates in the world. But you wouldn’t know that by reading Chinese media reports. Beijing has seized on random incidents of violence in Japan as evidence of a broader safety problem, pointing, for example, to the stabbing of three teenagers this month in Osaka. “The security environment in some areas of Japan has been unstable, and similar vicious cases have been occurring frequently,” the Chinese consulate in Osaka said in a statement that warned citizens against traveling to Japan. China has also suggested that Japan has a road safety problem, even though traffic fatalities are relatively low in the country. Last month, the Chinese authorities highlighted an incident in which a car rammed into pedestrians along a street in Tokyo’s popular Shinjuku neighborhood. Beijing said that two Chinese nationals were seriously injured. The Chinese embassy in Japan even issued a warning about a record surge in bear attacks in the country. Experts said that Beijing would have to work hard to convince the public to forgo trips to Japan, given the love in the mainland for Japanese food, culture and products. “They’re reaching for the stuff they think might get people’s attention,” Mr. Tong said. “But Japan is such an attractive place to visit. In the long term, they might not be able to keep people away.” Kiuko Notoya and Hisako Ueno contributed reporting from Tokyo and Chris Buckley from Taipei. Javier C.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT It was a recent late night in the VIP Club, the hedonistic heart of Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy’s most ski-and-be-seen winter destination. An Olympic security manager watched from the bar as scions of wealthy families, men in expensive sweaters and women in backless leotards sang along with the piano player to Lionel Richie’s “All Night Long (All Night).” Others kicked back with champagne and admired the view of the Olympic sliding track, winding like a glow worm through the Cortina night. The Winter Olympics, much of which are based in Cortina, have shined a light on the natural beauty of its surrounding landscape, a valley bathed in sunshine and wrapped by the craggy Dolomite mountains. But Cortina’s beautiful people hope the Games can also revive Cortina’s long-held reputation for glamour, which has waned in recent generations. “We have the opportunity to show the world how Cortina is beautiful in a different way , ” said Manuel D’Avanzo, the owner of the VIP Club, which he called “a holy grail” for wealthy, night-life loving Italians. It is a place, he said, with heritage and history — and now a sponsorship deal with Rolls-Royce. At least one sliding-sport athlete admitted to slipping out with teammates to party at the club during the Games, though he was granted anonymity when he pleaded that without it, he would be thrown off the team. (“Our coach will kill us,” he said.) Mr. D’Avanzo agreed that it was more prudent for athletes to come after they won their competitions, “not before.” Image Placing trees around the Olympic rings in Cortina in early February. The town also hosted the 1956 Olympics. Credit... James Hill for The New York Times Cortina, once a small village of shepherds and farmers, has long served as a winter playground of the Italian upper class. Carriages ferried aristocrats to their Cortina villas in the 19th century. In the 1920s, Ernest Hemingway boozed here, calling the area “the swellest” place on earth. The 1956 Olympics, which the town hosted, “internationalized Cortina,” according to its current mayor, Gianluca Lorenzi. In the 1960s, Hollywood nobility flocked here along with “all of the Dolce Vita,” he said, referring to the stars of the golden age of Italian cinema. They kept coming through the 1980s, when libidinous Christmas comedies named after Panettone cakes were set here and immortalized the town in the broader Italian imagination. Cortina lost its luster in recent decades, and the Olympics helped bring new investment, hotels and luxury. “So we can say the jet set also welcomed us hosting the Olympics,” Mr. Lorenzi said. Since the Olympics started, the fashionable crowd in fox and mink coats have been outnumbered by fans wearing bright wigs, puffer jackets branded with national flags, and the odd dinosaur outfit. But the Games have shown that the pursuits of athletic excellence and decadent indulgence can coexist.

Alessandro Grassani for The New York Times During the opening ceremonies, as national delegations began parading in alphabetical order down the town’s main drag at 8:42 p.m., the leading figures in Cortina had gathered around televisions farther down the street, at the Hôtel de la Poste. They managed to sit still until about the letter M. “At 9:30, we start the music again,” the DJ announced to a cheer. “Or even earlier.” “If I wanted to watch TV, I would have stayed home,” one woman said as the music started back up and she and other middle-aged patrons began to dance vigorously at the screens. Gherardo Manaigo, the sixth-generation owner of Hôtel de la Poste, went around shaking hands. He had grown up with stories of the wonderful Olympic atmosphere. “Now it’s our time,” he said as Filippo Borghi, La Poste’s famous bartender, made signature cocktails.

Alessandro Grassani for The New York Times Throughout the Games, helicopters have brought the superrich to a helipad near the 1956 Olympic ski-jump venue. In the years after those games, fatal crashes led to the closure of a small airport and to the end of plane travel to Cortina. “We don’t want the airport,” Mr. Lorenzi said, speaking for the nay side of the debate over a possible airport, though he did see a near future in which the jet set could be replaced by the drone set . Aviation officials, he said, had told him that “the first drone” carrying up to 18 people to the mountains would arrive by 2030. In the meantime, jet setters have to schlep along winding roads, but some said they appreciated the drive, that it sealed them off from the demands of the real world. In the days before the Games began, a group of elegantly tailored Italians who lived and worked in Miami, New York and London gathered to celebrate the anniversary of a previous bash they had held on sailboats in Bodrum, Turkey. The idea, said Federico Pellegrini, 35, a Miami-based fashion executive, was for all the invitees to bring a friend so that they could “assess if they are eligible for the good vibes,” he said.

Alessandro Grassani for The New York Times Mr. Pellegrini’s friends, mostly Cortina veterans dressed in exquisite fabrics, fur coats and hats, talked about how taking it easy was actually quite difficult. “An intense job. You get up at 7:30 to ski,” said Pier Alberto Patergnani, 32, an Italian who works for an artificial-intelligence company in London. Then, he said there was lunch, après-ski, “town,” happy hour, dinner and finally clubbing. The Olympics had injected more life into Cortina, he said, and his friends from the boating trip could feel it. They wore short fur coats over short shorts and spoke excitedly about catching a glimpse of an Italian athlete training on the slopes. Mr. Patergnani’s group often ended up at the VIP Club, where Francesco Bernardin, the 55-year-old piano player, explained the tastes of Qataris, Americans and Russians “who love Abba.” Tamara Khermayer, a longtime VIP patron, took a break from singing her heart out to sip a gin fizz at a bar built from an 18th-century pharmacy counter. She said that Cortina, unlike St. Moritz and other fancy locales, had a more intimate feeling. “It’s an expensive home,” she said, “but it’s still home.” Image Some hope the Games can revive Cortina’s long-held reputation for glamour. Credit... Alessandro Grassani for The New York Times During the Games, the VIP Club has had unlikely competition from the Corona Zero Green Room, a lounge with nonalcoholic beer in the Olympic Village, where the athletes are staying a short bus ride from town. Despite their apparent sobriety, the athletes “are flirting a bit,” said Nena Dekker, a bartender at the green room. Competitors from Liechtenstein had handed her “paper with their number on it,” she said. The top athletes, though, seemed to have other things on their minds. Hitting Cortina’s party scene was not on the agenda, the Italian skier Federica Brignone said shortly after winning the gold medal in the super-G downhill race. “I haven’t eaten from 6:45 in the morning and my legs need treatment, so no,” Ms. Brignone said. Instead, she would spend time with her family: “I will celebrate after the Olympics.” Jason Horowitz is the Madrid bureau chief for The Times, covering Spain, Portugal and the way people live throughout Europe.

Vincent Alban/The New York Times Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 7:22 min Learn more Share full article 4 By Motoko Rich Reporting from Milan Feb. 20, 2026 The Italian speedskater Francesca Lollobrigida had just won a gold medal and set an Olympic record — on her 35th birthday, no less — but her toddler son Tommaso stole the limelight. Ms. Lollobrigida, holding her 2-year-old son in her arms with her gold medal slung around his neck, answered questions from reporters while Tommaso, bleating “Mamma,” grabbed her nose, batted a broadcaster’s microphone, and ripped the Team Italy headband off her head. “Wait one second, love,” Ms. Lollobrigida said, never breaking her composure. The reaction to Ms. Lollobrigida’s breakout moment revealed the complicated landscape for Italian women who want to balance their professional and family lives. While medal-winning Italian men who celebrated with their children attracted little attention, Ms. Lollobrigida’s multitasking went viral. Several Italian newspapers ran front page photos of her holding Tommaso, under headlines playing on the word “Mamma.” Giorgia Meloni, Italy’s first female prime minister and also a mother, joined a largely supportive chorus by praising Ms. Lollobrigida’s “ Italian pride, talent, and determination .” Amid the support, there was still plenty of criticism. Scoffing at Tommaso’s naughty behavior that threw shade at Ms. Lollobrigida’s parenting skills. Jibes at her husband for not taking control and removing his son from the scene. Even the positive reaction expressed an implicit surprise at a female champion who was also a successful parent. “In Italy we still have the meaning that the man needs to work and the woman needs to stay home, you know?” Ms. Lollobrigida said in an interview with The New York Times. Image Ms. Lollobrigida, celebrating gold with her 2-year-old son Tommaso. Credit... Luca Bruno/Associated Press Ms. Lollobrigida’s multitasking with her child might have felt familiar to working mothers anywhere. The reaction to it was one of several moments in the Games that showed the challenges still faced in particular by Italy’s sportswomen, who have achieved growing success and publicity at these Olympics while never shaking the chauvinism of their society. After the Italian skier Federica Brignone won the first of two gold medals in Cortina earlier this month, her father, Daniele Brignone, told a reporter he hoped she would quit skiing and “stay home and give me two beautiful grandchildren.” A piece in Il Sole 24 Ore, Italy’s main business newspaper, described the women of Italy’s Olympic delegation — many of them in their mid 30s — as “irresistible girls” who won while “the biological clock goes faster than they do.” Unlike Ms. Lollobrigida, most Italian female athletes retire before having children, said Francesca Vitali, an assistant professor in sports sciences at the University of Verona. “The perception is, if you are an athlete, probably you are not so good of a mother,” Ms. Vitali said. In Italy, a lower proportion of women work than in most other European countries and earn nearly 40 percent less on average than men. Meanwhile, the birthrate has fallen to one of the lowest in Europe — in part, experts say, because of the lack of support for working mothers. While Italy has traditionally been a family-focused culture, some of the backlash against Ms. Lollobrigida’s son during her gold medal interviews may reflect a declining tolerance for children in public places, said Letizia Mencarini, a demographer at Bocconi University in Milan. As births have declined, “we are not used to seeing children anymore,” Ms. Mencarini said. Image Ms. Lollobrigida came to sport early. By the time she was 14 months old, she was on roller blades, and as a teenager, she won national, and then international, championships. Credit... Vincent Alban/The New York Times Ms. Lollobrigida said in the interview with the Times that she hoped to challenge some of these trends. “I want to show that it’s possible” to combine professional achievement with motherhood, she said this week following practice in Milan, four days after she had won her second gold medal . Ms. Lollobrigida came to sport early. The eldest of two daughters, she grew up outside Rome with their father, Maurizio, a onetime rollerskating champion and swim coach, and mother, Sondra Bergamini, a physical education teacher. By the time she was 14 months old, Ms. Lollobrigida was on roller skates. By the time she was 3, she was on inline skates. As a teenager, she won national, and then international, championships. “I’ve known many boys and girls who were even better, maybe, than Francesca, but didn’t have the patience and the perseverance to keep at it,” said her father, Mr. Lollobrigida, 64. She sacrificed school trips and parties to train, often driving hours on a Friday night to get to an ice rink in the north of Italy. When classmates teased her about her legs being too big and powerful for a girl, she persisted. During the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Ms. Lollobrigida began to harbor her own Olympic ambitions. She reached out to Maurizio Marchetto, Italy’s national speed skating coach, and asked if he would help her transition from wheels to blades. She often practiced with men, but highlighted her femininity with pink stripes on her skates or manicures in bright colors. (She won her first two gold medals in Milan sporting bold green nails.)

Vincent Alban/The New York Times At the Winter Games in Sochi in 2014, she placed 23rd in the 3,000 meters. Eight years later at the Beijing Games, she finally won Olympics bronze and silver medals. After Beijing, she told her coach that she and her husband, Matteo Angeletti — who she met on the inline skating circuit — wanted to start a family. She figured that if she gave birth within a year, she could take leave and retrain in time to compete in the next Winter Olympics in her home country. “She was good at choosing her timing,” said Mr. Marchetto, her coach. As soon as she told her parents she was pregnant, her father said, he scoured the internet for studies on women who had returned to elite sports after childbirth. Ms. Lollobrigida modified her workout during her pregnancy . When Tommaso was 4 months old, Ms. Lollobrigida returned to full-time training. She wanted to continue to breastfeed, so Italy’s ice sports federation paid for her mother and sister to join her to care for the baby while she was away from her home outside Rome. Because Italy does not have a permanent indoor skating oval, the athletes travel as much as 250 days a year to train and compete in other countries. “We sports people have to be an example,” said Andrea Gios, president of the federation. He said he hoped the success of athletes like Ms. Lollobrigida would “spread in our country a different culture” of support for working parents.

Mr. Angeletti is not fazed. “I knew what I was getting myself into,” he said during an online interview with Tommaso playing with a toy helicopter in the background. The couple had Tommaso on skates before his first birthday. Lately, though, “he says ‘no’ because he associates the skates with when I’m away,” Ms. Lollobrigida said. After the Winter Games are over, Ms. Lollobrigida said she is done with Olympic competition. She and Mr. Angeletti want to tr",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, once regarded as a dashing war hero and the favorite son of Queen Elizabeth II, was arrested by the British police on Thursday amid widening scrutiny over his ties to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest, on suspicion of misconduct in public office, was a staggering blow to the British monarchy and the latest chapter in his downfall, coming months after his connections to Mr. Epstein led Buckingham Palace to strip him of his royal titles and evict from his royal residence. The police did not provide any details of the investigation. But the arrest of Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor, the younger brother of King Charles III who was formerly known as Prince Andrew, came after reports suggested that he may have shared confidential information with Mr. Epstein while serving as a British trade envoy, a position he held from 2001 to 2011. Video Former Prince Andrew Released After Arrest by British Police The British authorities released Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor after arresting him on suspicion of misconduct in public office following the latest release of documents linked to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Credit Credit... Kirsty Wigglesworth/Associated Press The police did not mention the accusations of sexual abuse that have shadowed Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor, 66, or the trafficking allegations that Mr. Epstein was facing when he died by suicide in a Manhattan jail in 2019. In a remarkable written statement addressed directly to the British public, Charles said he had learned of his brother’s arrest “with the deepest concern.” “What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities,” Charles wrote. “In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and cooperation.” He concluded his statement with a note of determination. “Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all,” Charles wrote. He later attended an event for London Fashion Week and his wife, Queen Camilla, went to a lunchtime orchestral concert in the city.

Simbarashe Cha/The New York Times The arrest was without precedent in modern British history. The last senior member of the royal family to be arrested in connection with a serious crime was King Charles I, who was executed for treason nearly four centuries ago, on Jan. 30, 1649. The arrest of Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor, who was released after around 11 hours in custody, escalated the crisis confronting the British crown amid deepening revelations of his connections to Mr. Epstein and allegations that he sexually abused a young woman trafficked to him by the American. The former prince has denied that he raped the woman, Virginia Roberts Giuffre. A British anti-monarchy group, Republic, said it had reported evidence of potential misconduct in public office to the Thames Valley Police, the police force west of London that is leading the investigation. Gordon Brown, who was the British prime minister when Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor was a government trade envoy, issued a statement on Thursday saying that he had provided additional information about Mr. Epstein to the Thames Valley Police ahead of Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest. The Thames Valley Police, citing national guidelines, did not identify the man they had arrested, but confirmed that they had taken “a man in his sixties from Norfolk” into custody at about 8 a.m. and were carrying out searches at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk. The police were seen in Norfolk on Thursday morning at the Sandringham Estate, the private, 20,000-acre country retreat of Charles and Camilla, where Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor has been living since he was evicted earlier this year from the Royal Lodge, his residence in Windsor. Image Members of the media near Royal Lodge, Andrew’s former home, in Windsor on Thursday. Credit... Jaimi Joy/Reuters The police later confirmed that the man they had arrested was “released under investigation,” a designation that indicated that the investigation was not over. Photos shared by the BBC showed Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor in the back seat of a car appearing to leave a police station where he had been held. Under British law, the police generally cannot hold suspects for more than 24 hours without charging them. In the British legal system, the investigation could continue with charges filed at a later date. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor’s representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. According to the guidance provided to British prosecutors, misconduct in public office is committed when a public officer “willfully neglects to perform their duty” or “willfully misconducts themselves” in abuse of the public trust. No case has ever tested whether a member of the royal family could be considered a public officer, but Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor, in addition to serving as a government trade envoy, was a helicopter pilot for the Royal Navy during the war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands in 1982. He met Mr. Epstein in the late 1990s through Ghislaine Maxwell, then the financier’s girlfriend and the daughter of the British media magnate Robert Maxwell. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor told the BBC in 2019 that the friendship was valuable, partly because of the networking opportunities it offered. Ms. Giuffre had accused Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell of recruiting her for sexual abuse under the guise of becoming a professional masseuse. In 2022, Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor paid Ms. Giuffre an undisclosed sum to settle a lawsuit in a New York court that accused him of raping her when she was 17. He did not admit any wrongdoing in the case. Ms. Giuffre died by suicide last year. On Thursday, her family welcomed Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest. “At last,” the family said. “Today, our broken hearts have been lifted at the news that no one is above the law, not even royalty.” Image A widely published photograph showing Andrew, then still a prince, and Virginia Giuffre.

US District Court — Southern District of New York That view was echoed by David Lammy, Britain’s deputy prime minister and justice secretary, who told the BBC that “nobody in this country is above the law” and that the investigation “must happen in the usual way.” The arrest underscored a striking contrast in the official responses to the Epstein files, which have tainted the reputations of powerful figures in business, academia, entertainment and politics. The British authorities have moved aggressively to investigate the possibility of crimes emerging from the documents, while the police in the United States have not. President Trump, discussing the arrest with reporters, said: “I think it’s a shame. I think it’s very sad. I think it’s so bad for the royal family.” In Britain, the police are also investigating whether Peter Mandelson , a longtime British political operative who served as ambassador to the United States, committed misconduct in public office by sharing sensitive government documents with Mr. Epstein. He has denied any criminal wrongdoing. The files also revealed that Sarah Ferguson, Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor’s ex-wife and the onetime Duchess of York, carried on a long and personal correspondence with Mr. Epstein long after he was convicted of soliciting prostitution in 2008.

The New York Times Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 8:01 min Learn more Share full article 16 By Max Bearak Annie Correal Patricia Sulbarán Isayen Herrera and Genevieve Glatsky The reporters have been covering the aftermath of the U.S. military’s removal of President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela. Isayen Herrera reported from Caracas, Venezuela. Feb. 19, 2026 Venezuelan lawmakers passed a wide-ranging amnesty bill on Thursday that could free hundreds of political prisoners, in perhaps the strongest indication yet that the interim government, under pressure from the United States, is moving to ease some of the regime’s most repressive tactics. But some experts and activists for political prisoners say the amnesty measure, while long overdue, leaves out many people held by the state and relies on a compromised judiciary system to carry out the law. Even some of its supporters have called it imperfect. The law applies to the years in power of the ruling government, starting in 1999, the first year in office of former President Hugo Chávez, a self-described socialist and charismatic strongman leader who put in place the current regime before his death in 2013. The amnesty law, however, extends only to prisoners who were detained in a limited number of protests. Critics of the proposal also note that prisoners facing some of the most serious charges, such as those accused of violent, armed actions, will not be eligible. According to rights groups, these kind of allegations were often arbitrarily applied and often based on fabricated evidence. The bill’s passage comes as the United States is pressuring Delcy Rodríguez, the interim president of Venezuela, to steer its economy toward U.S. interests and to pursue democratic changes after a quarter-century of increasingly authoritarian rule. Over that period, thousands of Venezuelans and foreigners have been detained , many on drummed-up charges, according to rights groups, and usually for opposing the government. “I say this as the acting president of the Chavista government,” Ms. Rodríguez said on Thursday at a ceremony at the presidential palace, where she signed the law after the national legislature approved it earlier that day. “We must know how to ask for forgiveness and how to receive forgiveness, and that is the process that this amnesty law sets in motion.” She also publicly called on Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello to review cases excluded from the amnesty law, a noteworthy move amid tensions between her pragmatic wing of the ruling government and his hard-line faction . Rights groups estimate that 600 to 900 political prisoners remain incarcerated in the country as of this week, including opposition politicians, journalists and others. The groups have documented torture and abuse in Venezuela’s prisons, and dozens of political prisoners have died in captivity or are missing . In addition to concerns about exclusions baked into the amnesty legislation, there is also widespread fear that the government will not fully abide by the new law. The government remains largely unchanged after President Nicolás Maduro was captured by the United States on Jan. 3 and jailed in New York. Ms. Rodríguez must now navigate growing scrutiny at home and from Washington. In a social media post last week, President Trump called relations with Venezuela “extraordinary,” and Ms. Rodríguez said on NBC that she had been invited to the White House. Last week, students organized modest marches and rallies across Venezuela , demanding blanket amnesty for all political prisoners and denouncing the measure as falling short. And on Thursday, United Nations human rights experts called for the unconditional release of all arbitrarily detained people. U.S. and Venezuela officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Image Delcy Rodríguez, the interim president of Venezuela, before her swearing-in last month. Credit... The New York Times Who could be freed under the new law? The new law will apply to many of the hundreds of people incarcerated for reasons linked to their opposition to the government, and will expunge their criminal records. But the amnesty is narrow in scope. Only prisoners detained in connection with about a dozen specific “politically motivated violent events” will be eligible. These events were mostly large protests that in some cases spanned months and include a failed coup against Mr. Chávez in 2002. These restrictions will most likely mean that not all political prisoners will be released, said Nicmer Evans, a political scientist and government critic recently held in El Helicoide . Mr. Evans, who called the law “unjust,” said it could exclude those jailed for criticizing the government outside the periods specified in the law. “Practically all of us journalists who have been detained for our opinions outside of these established time frames are excluded,” he said. Activists are also wary that, under the law, those released must go before the judicial authorities, who will “verify the grounds for amnesty” before granting a pardon, raising concerns that the highly politicized courts may have too much discretion over the process. The activists have called for an independent commission that includes international human rights organizations to supervise carrying out the law.

Ms. Rodríguez has to balance the demands of the Trump administration and an entrenched political system known as Chavismo, after its founder, Mr. Chávez. That system has been sustained through repression and elections marred by fraud, according to Venezuela experts. Ms. Rodríguez and her brother, Jorge Rodríguez, are believed to be some of the chief architects and beneficiaries of that system. Still, since the capture of Mr. Maduro, Ms. Rodríguez has embraced the amnesty law and pledged to close El Helicoide, the prison that Mr. Trump appeared to be referring to when he said that Venezuela had vowed to close a “torture chamber.” More than 400 political prisoners have been released since Mr. Maduro’s ouster. Mr. Rodríguez, the president of the National Assembly, recently apologized to Venezuelans for any crimes committed by the state after Mr. Chávez came to power. Image A mural of former President Hugo Chávez’s eyes in downtown Caracas. Credit... The New York Times Is Venezuela becoming less repressive? Since the capture of Mr. Maduro, there have been emerging signs that repression in the country might be easing . And some Venezuelans say the amnesty law is a key part of that process. “The amnesty is a first step in the right direction,” Michael Penfold, a professor in Caracas of political economy and governance, said on social media Feb. 7. Mr. Penfold, who has been critical of the government, recently joined the interim government’s new Program for Coexistence and Peace, a national plan that seeks to restore political dialogue. But many in Venezuela say the amnesty law does not go far enough. Delsa Solórzano, a lawyer and former legislator who went into hiding after the country’s fraud-marred presidential election in 2024, said in an interview last week that the bill did not include the repeal of certain laws that have “served as real instruments of political persecution,” referencing, among others, an “anti-hate” measure, which has been used to silence critics. The law allows those outside the country, many political exiles, to seek amnesty through their lawyers. But the law excludes anyone who has promoted armed action against Venezuela, like María Corina Machado, the exiled oppositio",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The World Anti-Doping Agency was told by a whistle-blower in recent months that the current head of Russia’s antidoping agency had participated in the government-sponsored doping scheme uncovered after the 2014 Sochi Olympics, according to two people with knowledge of the accusation. The Russian agency’s director general, Veronika Loginova, was directly involved in the attempted cover-up of drug test results from the 2014 Winter Games, according to the whistle-blower, who claimed to have firsthand knowledge of Ms. Loginova’s role. The accusation has surfaced as Russia tries to re-establish its Olympic eligibility and prepares to field a small team at next month’s Paralympics after more than a decade of bans and sanctions. The claims about the Russian agency could not be independently verified by The Times. Ms. Loginova on Friday dismissed the accusations as “fantasies” and said that she was working on educational programs during the 2014 Games. “I had no potential involvement in the antidoping laboratory’s operations, much less influence the collection of doping samples and their subsequent testing,” she said in an email response to questions from The Times. The agency and Ms. Loginova did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for WADA, the body responsible for ensuring fair competition in Olympic sports, confirmed on Thursday that the agency had received a tip from “a known source who made a new and serious allegation.” He did not name the person who had been accused but said the agency had passed the information to its intelligence and investigations department to follow up on the claim. The spokesman, James Fitzgerald, said WADA’s management did not have details about the status of the investigation. He added that the claim had initially been provided without supporting evidence and that no corroborating evidence had been produced. If true, the accusations against Ms. Loginova suggest that Russia handed the reins of its antidoping watchdog to someone who was involved with the execution of one of the most elaborate doping schemes in history. Russia is still trying to prove its legitimacy in the sports world after a scandal that stemmed from the 2014 Games, when a state-sponsored doping program boosted the performance of its athletes . WADA in 2019 discovered that Russia had systematically deleted or altered the drug testing data of more than 200 Russian athletes to protect them from testing positive and to enable them to compete. The 2014 Games were the last time Russia competed with a full Olympic team, under its own flag. Since then it has been barred from the Summer and Winter Games, first for the doping violations and more recently for its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. ( Some Russians have been allowed to compete as neutral athletes.) But Russia, whose antidoping agency has officially not complied with WADA rules for the better part of 10 years, is now poised to re-enter the Olympic fold at next month’s Paralympic Games in Italy. The Paralympians’ inclusion could pave the way for Russia to bring a full team to the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. “They’re getting back into competition, now people are starting to put them under a lens and saying, ‘What’s going over there?” said Travis Tygart, the chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency. “Because of the state program there, and continued noncompliance, they’ve lost any benefit of doubt that they otherwise would be entitled to.” At a scheduled news conference on Friday, the International Olympic Committee’s president, Kirsty Coventry, said that she was unaware of the accusations involving Ms. Loginova. At the 2014 Sochi Games, Russia carried out a meticulously planned doping scheme involving the country’s antidoping officials and agents of the Federal Security Service, the successor agency to the K.G.B. They tampered with the urine samples provided by Russian athletes. In 2021, Ms. Loginova was chosen as the new director of RUSADA, the Russian antidoping agency, in a process overseen by WADA. An independent observer had been assigned to monitor that election process. According to the RUSADA website, she began her antidoping career in 2010 while working there. She also worked in antidoping at the Federal Medical-Biological Agency and the Russian Ministry of Sport and represented Russia in official delegations at the Olympics from 2014 to 2020, according to the website. For her work in sports, the Russian government awarded her the Medal of the Order “For Merit to the Fatherland.” Juliet Macur is a national reporter at The Times, based in Washington, D.C., who often writes about America through the lens of sports.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Most people who trickled into a historical movie theater in the border city of McAllen, Texas, this week had heard of Bobby Pulido, the Latin Grammy Award-winning Tejano singer running for Congress in the oddly shaped district jutting from the border to the outskirts of San Antonio, some 250 miles straight north. But on this day, the candidate they had come to hear was the one breathing fire about dismantling Immigration and Customs Enforcement, legalizing abortion and challenging the insular Democratic Party in the Rio Grande Valley. That wasn’t Mr. Pulido , the favorite of the party. It was Ada Cuellar, an emergency room doctor running considerably to his left. Alex Cantu, 42, said Mr. Pulido’s run was “a fame grab” by “basically what I would refer to as an establishment politician.” Mr. Cantu had organized a vigil after federal agents killed Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, and he said he wanted real change. The fight for the Democratic nomination to challenge Representative Monica De La Cruz, the Republican incumbent in Texas’ 15th District, gets to the struggle for the soul of the party in 2026. Democratic primary voters in Texas began voting Tuesday ahead of the March 3 primary, and their choice, like many Democrats around the country, is whether they want to push their party to the left in a year when the wind is at Democrats’ back, or elevate centrists who traditionalists say can win swing districts like the 15th in November. The Democratic primary for the seat of Texas’ senior senator , John Cornyn, holds a similar dynamic, pitting Representative Jasmine Crockett, a firebrand intent on mobilizing the Democratic base, against State Representative James Talarico, who is appealing to the center and disaffected Republicans.

Gabriel V. Cárdenas for The New York Times But far from the glare of that spotlight are Democratic voters in El Valle, as the Rio Grande Valley is known. And there, another question looms: Where will the Hispanic voters who flocked to President Trump in 2024 go in 2026, amid the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown, and which type of candidate do they prefer? Cine El Rey is known as the Mexican Apollo because its advocacy of Mexican cinema parallels the Apollo Theater’s advocacy of Black artists in Harlem, and inside, Dr. Cuellar, who recently added a law degree to her medical résumé, was doing some advocacy of her own. She promised to push for the dismantling of ICE and had harsh words for Democratic Party stalwarts who have made their preference for Mr. Pulido clear . “I’m told I’m a progressive,” Dr. Cuellar said in an interview. Mr. Pulido, with his endorsements, name recognition and a ground game that has touched all 11 counties in the district, appears to be the favorite, but not necessarily with the voters most frustrated with Mr. Trump’s return to power, like Mia Diaz-Aleman. “We need someone who is a fighter,” Ms. Diaz-Aleman, 42, of McAllen, said of Dr. Cuellar, adding, “We’ve done the central view before, and that has gotten us nowhere.” Over the summer, the Republican-controlled state legislature redrew the 15th District to favor their candidate, but if Latino voters are shifting, Democrats believe the district is still in play — with the right candidate. Dr. Cuellar, who has poured a lot of her own money into her campaign, said she supports codifying Roe v. Wade, expanding access to health care to all and pushing for federal immigration authorities to confine enforcement actions to criminals. She also has the endorsement of Ms. Crockett. She describes herself as a “mama bear” and a “fighter,” a single mother who decided to run after years of frustration with the local political system and its “compadrismo,” or cronyism, where only those with political connections are supported. “People want somebody outside of the establishment,” she said. Mr. Pulido is less categorical and more circumspect. He wants a secure border but opposes agents going after otherwise law-abiding immigrants. He wants to expand health care, but especially to those in poor or rural communities, where people often have to drive long distances to find a hospital. He wants to do away with some tariffs, the ones that hurt agriculture.

Gabriel V. Cárdenas for The New York Times The race has also turned personal, in large part thanks to ads and social media posts for Dr. Cuellar and social media posts that attack Mr. Pulido for his views on abortion and ties to Democratic Party leaders. “People are just waking up right now,” Dr. Cuellar said. “I’m the one who is pro-choice and he wants to leave it to Texas politicians.” In an interview this week in his native Edinburg, Texas, Mr. Pulido said that while he personally opposes abortion, he also opposes his state’s near-total ban on abortion, without exceptions for rape and incest. Pushed again, he went much further, saying women should be able to make their own medical decisions. “It’s not my place to tell a woman what she can do with her body,” he said. “Policy is different than my personal beliefs.” He said he also has his eyes on the general election. He has decided not to run negative ads against his opponent and said he’ll continue to rely on events that attract far larger crowds than the two dozen or so that came to Cine El Rey to see Dr. Cuellar. Democratic leaders in the area have said that they will not endorse anyone in the race until after the primary, but some expressed confidence that Mr. Pulido’s more socially conservative stances could bring back voters from the Republican camp. Mr. Pulido, a father of four and a generational Texas Latino with two Latin Grammy Awards, said people see him as a rugged cowboy-hat-wearing Spanish-language performer with rural sensibilities. Outside an early polling site in Edinburg, Ernesto Rosales, 48, a gun owner and longtime Democrat, said he agreed. “When you decide to run normally, people don’t know who you are, right? And you have to spend a lot of time and a lot of money and a lot of effort to build that name recognition,” Mr. Rosales said. “Bobby didn’t need to do that. He’s a name brand here and with the Latino community.” “To me he resonates, because he’s a middle of the ground kind of guy,” he said. “He speaks to me.” Edgar Sandoval covers Texas for The Times, with a focus on the Latino community and the border with Mexico.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT President Trump said on Thursday that he had directed his administration to begin releasing files related to aliens, extraterrestrial life and unidentified flying objects, only hours after attacking former President Barack Obama for saying that aliens were real. It was the latest effort by Mr. Trump, ever the television showman, to stir anticipation for the release of secret government documents , even as he has continued to lash out at reporters over the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files and his connections to the disgraced financier. The release of the Epstein files has dragged on for nearly a year and Mr. Trump did not set a timeline for files on aliens. “Based on the tremendous interest shown,” Mr. Trump wrote on social media, he had directed officials to “begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters.” For decades, sightings of cutting-edge spy planes, drones, low-orbit satellites and weather balloons have driven theories about U.F.O.s, most famously at a secret military flight testing base called Area 51 . While many reports of unidentified flying objects remain unsolved , the Pentagon has found no evidence that the government was covering up knowledge of extraterrestrial technology and has said there is no evidence that any U.F.O. sightings represented alien visitation to Earth. But government assurances have done little to deter U.F.O. enthusiasts, who continue to trade theories and grainy videos of strange phenomena in the skies on Reddit and other social media platforms. The beginnings of Mr. Trump’s latest planned file dump started with a podcast interview. Brian Tyler Cohen, a YouTuber and podcast host, asked Mr. Obama in an interview that released on Saturday if aliens were real. The former president replied, “they’re real, but I haven’t seen them and they’re not being kept in Area 51.” He added, jokingly, “unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president.” Mr. Cohen did not ask any follow-up questions about aliens. Mr. Obama’s remarks pinballed across the internet as commentators speculated about what he had meant. Mr. Obama later clarified on social media that he meant that extraterrestrial life likely exists out in the universe, but that as far as he knew they had not visited Earth. He insisted, “I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!” When asked about Mr. Obama’s speculative remarks on Air Force One earlier on Thursday, Mr. Trump claimed that Mr. Obama “gave classified information, he’s not supposed to be doing that.” When a reporter asked for clarification, and if aliens were real, Trump said that he didn’t know, but repeated his suggestion that Obama’s remarks had revealed classified information. “He made a big mistake,” Mr. Trump said, with what appeared to be a smile . “He took it out of classified information.” Mr. Trump added that he did not have an opinion on the matter and that he would get Mr. Obama “out of trouble by declassifying” the relevant documents.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Large banners of President Trump now hang from multiple federal buildings in Washington, including the nation’s top law enforcement branch, in a bold statement of power and influence over the government. A long blue banner with Mr. Trump’s visage was draped on the exterior of the Justice Department headquarters in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, making it the latest federal building to have a banner with the president’s face. The banner’s lower border says “Make America Safe Again” in capital letters. The signage is a strikingly prominent indication of how Mr. Trump has eroded the separation that has long existed between the Justice Department and the White House to protect the department from political influence. That careful distance has been dissolving since the beginning of Mr. Trump’s second term. He has installed allies at the top ranks of the department to oversee a retribution campaign and investigate perceived political enemies. Hundreds of agency lawyers have since been fired, and thousands more have resigned . The White House referred all questions pertaining to the Justice Department’s banner — including the reason behind its installation, its cost and the duration of its display — to the Justice Department, which did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Similar banners were installed at other federal buildings last year, including the Agriculture Department and Labor Department. The banner hung between columns at the Washington headquarters of the Agriculture Department says “Growing America Since 1862.” It hangs a few columns away from a banner depicting Abraham Lincoln. An Agriculture Department spokesperson said on Thursday that the department was excited to celebrate America’s 250th anniversary, “particularly the roles our farmers and ranchers had in shaping our nation.” Image The Department of Agriculture. Credit... Eric Lee for The New York Times Image The Department of Labor. Credit... Eric Lee for The New York Times The Trump banner at the Labor Department says, “American Workers First,” also in capital letters, and carries the emblem for the nation’s 250th anniversary. Along the same frontage hangs a banner showing Theodore Roosevelt, with the same wording and emblem. Those two banners cost roughly $6,000, and were originally created for Labor Day, said Courtney Parella, a spokeswoman for the Labor Department. After receiving “tremendous positive response,” the department decided that they would stay up throughout the celebrations for America’s semiquincentennial, she said. The banners follow a string of efforts by the administration to emblazon the president’s name and face on everything from coins to national park passes . Such displays are more often a feature of countries run by dictators, not democratically elected leaders. “This is not just egotistical self-satisfaction, it’s a way of expanding presidential power,” Michael Beschloss, the presidential historian, told The Times recently . “A president is more powerful, I assume he believes, if he is ever-present than if he keeps his head down.” The same day that the banner was hung on the Justice Department building, Mr. Trump hosted the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace , a new international body he created. It was held at the Donald J. Trump United States Institute of Peace, a decades-old organization recently renamed for the president. “Marco named it after me,” Mr. Trump said in his opening remarks at Board of Peace meeting, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio sat a few feet away. “I had nothing to do with it, I swear I didn’t. I swear. I had no idea.” Ashley Ahn covers breaking news for The Times from New York.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT President Trump started the day on Thursday by celebrating peace in the Middle East while also threatening to launch a new, all-out attack in the region. Shortly thereafter, he celebrated that his handpicked arts commission had approved his $400 million White House ballroom project. By the day’s end, Mr. Trump was speaking to a crowd in northwest Georgia, where he was supposed to focus on the economy and jobs but spent much of the time on wild tangents: railing against the Supreme Court, making false claims of voter fraud and calling himself a “ schmuck ” for donating his presidential salary. The president’s head-spinning day came as Republicans look to Mr. Trump to lock down a message that will resonate ahead of the midterms, when the party could face big losses. They want him to stay focused on an economic message to help his party keep control of Congress in November’s midterm elections — but Mr. Trump is never one to stay on message. In fact, he sounded as though he wanted to move on entirely from the one issue they want him to focus on — affordability — as Democrats hammer him on the cost of living and high prices. “What word have you not heard over the last two weeks? Affordability,” Mr. Trump said at a rally at a steel distributor in Rome, Ga. “Because I’ve won. I’ve won affordability.” Earlier this week, the president’s top aides and cabinet officials gathered near the U.S. Capitol to discuss their midterm strategy. The takeaway was clear: The economy would be the deciding factor in the midterms, strategists and pollsters said, and Republicans needed to stay laser-focused. But even if Republican candidates and Mr. Trump’s aides focus on the economy, they can never match the megaphone of their leader, who is not quite so laser-focused on the issue. Still, Mr. Trump and his allies have been eager to celebrate his economic wins on the heels of two strong economic reports : Employment growth in January came in at more than twice the rate that economists had expected, and inflation was softer than predicted. In his speech on Thursday, Mr. Trump attributed the country’s economic success to his tariff policies. He has vowed that the levies will reduce U.S. imports and shrink the trade deficit. “Tariff is my favorite word in the whole dictionary,” he said. But data released on Thursday showed the opposite of what Mr. Trump has promised has occurred : U.S. imports grew last year, and the trade deficit in goods hit a record high. Mr. Trump’s vision of reviving American manufacturing has so far not borne out either. U.S. manufacturers have cut more than 80,000 jobs in the past year. Mr. Trump did not mention that data on Thursday. Instead, he regaled the audience with anecdotes of his conversations with business leaders who have told the president of major investments they’re making in the United States because of his tariffs. He became most animated when discussing the pending Supreme Court case over his ability to institute sweeping tariffs. “I have to wait for this decision,” he said, raising his voice. “I’ve been waiting forever. Forever. And the language is clear that I have the right to do it as president. I have the right to put tariffs on for national security purposes.” In November, a majority of Supreme Court justices asked skeptical questions about Mr. Trump’s use of emergency powers to impose tariffs. A decision in the case could come as soon as Friday. Even though the speech was billed as part of Mr. Trump’s nationwide economic tour, the president, as he often does, frequently veered off topic. He rehashed some of his longstanding grievances — including not getting enough credit for growing the economy, and the media not recognizing him for eschewing his presidential salary. Throughout his meandering speech, Mr. Trump often found his way back to his core message: that former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. destroyed the country and Mr. Trump has resuscitated it. But not all of Mr. Trump’s supporters are feeling the economic renaissance the president described on Thursday. Charles Painter, 47, of Ringgold, Ga., described himself as a longtime supporter of the president, but he is still looking for economic relief. He said his property taxes had tripled. “It’s going slow, but hopefully it gets there,” Mr. Painter said. Mr. Trump’s trip took him back to the district that was, until last month, represented by Marjorie Taylor Greene, once a staunch supporter of the president. Ms. Greene said she broke with the president over his handling of the Epstein files, his commitment to “America first” ideals and his efforts to lower health care costs. She abruptly resigned from Congress in the middle of her term, creating a special election for her seat. As Ms. Greene stepped up her criticism, Mr. Trump branded her a “traitor.” Ms. Greene did not attend Thursday’s event. In the special election to fill Ms. Greene’s former seat, Mr. Trump has endorsed Clay Fuller, a local prosecutor. Mr. Fuller spoke before Mr. Trump on Thursday, and then the president invited him back to the stage because he “loved what he said.” Tyler Pager is a White House correspondent for The Times, covering President Trump and his administration.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The Trump administration announced on Thursday that it was reviving a proposal to prevent undocumented immigrants from receiving federal housing assistance, a policy that could displace tens of thousands of legal residents and citizens, many of them children , who live with unauthorized relatives in public housing. The proposal comes as the Department of Housing and Urban Development has stepped up efforts to scrutinize public housing rolls for undocumented immigrants, telling public housing authorities across the country on Friday that they would face sanctions if they did not do more to verify the legal status of residents. The Department of Housing and Urban Development had previously instructed landlords to follow existing rules that allow families of mixed immigration status to live in subsidized housing, so long as at least one household member is a legal resident. In those cases, the subsidies are prorated based on the number of eligible members of the family. But Scott Turner, the former pro football player whom President Trump picked to lead HUD, said in a fiery statement peppered with references to “illegal aliens” and “fraudsters” that his department would now move forward with a “zero tolerance” policy aimed at ejecting all undocumented immigrants, who he said were “riding the coattails of American taxpayers.” The move was a return to a policy, pushed by immigration hard-liners like Stephen Miller, that was first proposed in 2019, in Mr. Trump’s first term. Officials had said it was necessary to cut down on long waiting lists for public housing. The department’s statement gave similar reasoning on Thursday, writing that “HUD resources serve only a quarter of eligible households in need.” (The Trump administration issued plans in November to drastically slash support for long-term housing programs .) The 2019 proposal faced stiff opposition from landlords and local officials , who said that it would displace some of their most reliable tenants and add major financial strains to an already cash-strapped system. Undocumented immigrants, they said, generally pay rent on time, in part out of fear of drawing attention and referrals to law enforcement. According to a HUD analysis in 2019, more than 108,000 people receiving housing benefits were in a household with at least one undocumented immigrant. Because many of those immigrants have children who are U.S. citizens or legal residents, HUD estimated at the time that as many as 55,000 children who were in the country legally would have been displaced from public housing under the policy. There are more than 2.2 million residents in public housing nationwide . The HUD statement on Thursday characterized the current rule allowing mixed-status families to live together with prorated benefits as a “roommate loophole.” The statement was headlined: “Illegals, Ineligibles, and Fraudsters: Pack Your Bags,” accompanied by emojis.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The MAHA Moms have turned on President Trump. When Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. threw his support behind Mr. Trump’s 2024 campaign for the White House, his corps of health conscious, mostly female, followers embraced the president, who pledged to address Americans’ concerns about “toxins in our environments and pesticides in our food.” Some of the women, who call themselves the MAHA Moms after Mr. Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again movement, abandoned the Democratic Party to vote for Mr. Trump. But the executive order Mr. Trump issued Wednesday to increase domestic production of glyphosate — a widely used weedkiller and possible carcinogen that has been the target of thousands of lawsuits, including one brought by Mr. Kennedy — stunned and infuriated the activists. It now threatens to turn the brief MAHA-Trump marriage into a divorce. “Women feel like they were lied to, that MAHA movement is a sham,” said Alex Clark, a health and wellness podcaster for the conservative group Turning Point U.S.A., which is closely allied with the president. “How am I supposed to rally these women to vote red in the midterms? How can we win their trust back? I am unsure if we can.” Across the country on Thursday, many women who identified with the movement expressed similar feelings of betrayal from the president. But Mr. Kennedy, who issued a statement saying that Mr. Trump’s order would strengthen “our defense readiness and our food supply,” was spared the wrath of the movement’s leaders, if not its rank and file. “Secretary Kennedy has done everything he said he’s going to do,” said Vani Hari , a healthy eating activist and one-time Democrat (she worked to elect President Barack Obama) who has advised the administration on food policy. “He has upheld his commitment to the American people. Now, whether his boss is doing that is another story.” Image Robert F. Kennedy Jr. gave support to the Trump statement on glyphosate. Credit... Al Drago for The New York Times Ms. Hari has millions of social media followers. “There is a level of anger and frustration like I’ve never witnessed before,” she said. On her Instagram page, some of that anger was directed at Mr. Kennedy. “This begs the question why didn’t sec Kennedy have a say and stop it,” one commenter wrote. It is unclear whether the secretary was consulted on the order before it was issued. The White House and a spokesman for Mr. Kennedy would not say. “Where is RFK Jr.?” another commenter asked. In issuing his order, Mr. Trump invoked the Defense Production Act, a Korean-war era law that allows the government to compel the manufacture of supplies that are critical for national defense. The order is aimed at boosting domestic supplies of phosphorous, which is necessary for the manufacture of certain munitions, as well as for glyphosate, which has been deemed “probably carcinogenic to humans” by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Glyphosate is marketed as the weedkiller Roundup. In 2018, Mr. Kennedy helped win a $289 million jury award against Roundup’s maker, Monsanto, now owned by Bayer. “Ensuring an adequate supply of elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based herbicides is thus crucial to the national security and defense, including food-supply security,” the order said. Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, defended the order, saying it was “not an endorsement of any product or practice.” In a statement on behalf of Monsanto, a Bayer spokesman said Mr. Trump’s executive order “reinforces the critical need for U.S. farmers to have access to essential, domestically produced crop protection tools.” The company will “comply with this order to produce glyphosate and elemental phosphorus,” he said. Image Farm gear being loaded with glyphosate, also marketed as Roundup, in Illinois in 2010. Credit... Seth Perlman/Associated Press The order provides limited legal immunity to glyphosate’s makers, though it is unlikely to protect them against product liability lawsuits. Mr. Trump’s critics see the president helping the chemical industry and question whether there is legal justification for the order. “Invoking the Defense Production Act to spur the domestic production of glyphosate is a gross abuse of presidential authority,” said Lawrence O. Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University. “There is scant evidence that the United States’ agricultural sector and its ability to ensure a stable food supply is at risk.” Mr. Trump also faced pushback from Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican of Kentucky, who last month helped scuttle legislation that would have effectively given legal immunity to glyphosate manufacturers. Mr. Massie said Thursday that he would introduce legislation seeking to undo Mr. Trump’s order. The campaign against glyphosate has been central to the MAHA movement. Zen Honeycutt, the founder of the advocacy group Moms Across America, has been a leader in that campaign, commissioning private laboratory testing for pesticide residue and petitioning retailers to remove the chemicals from their shelves by framing it as a risk to children. In an interview, Ms. Honeycutt called Mr. Trump’s order “an egregious offense to what he promised” and “a betrayal.” As for Mr. Kennedy, she said his hands are tied: “Bobby is not in charge of Trump.” Representatives of MAHA Action and the MAHA Institute, part of a constellation of groups that support Mr. Kennedy’s agenda, did not respond to requests for comment. Environmental groups, which had been sidelined under the current administration, said the MAHA movement was to blame for throwing its support behind a president that had proven himself to be disastrous for health and the environment in his first term. “They voted for Trump, and they own this,” said Ken Cook, president and co-founder of the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization that has worked on pesticide issues. “Of course they were betrayed. And they betrayed the rest of us,” he said, adding, “There were plenty of warning signs.” There had indeed been red flags.

Niki Chan Wylie for The New York Times Last year, the Trump administration supported Bayer in a case that seeks to determine whether federal law shields pesticide manufacturers from lawsuits. Republicans in Congress have also proposed measures that would have effectively shielded Bayer and other pesticides makers from payouts to plaintiffs. That measure was defeated by a coalition of environmental groups, but a similar provision has been added to a draft of the farm bill. The Trump administration has appointed former chemical industry executives and lobbyists to senior roles overseeing pesticides and toxic chemicals, angering several prominent MAHA activists who circulated a petition last fall calling for E.P.A. Administrator Lee Zeldin to be fired. Mr. Zeldin has since promised that the agency would adopt a “MAHA agenda.” That agenda has not been released. Now, there is “a widening disconnect” between the voters who want to reduce chemicals and pesticides and the Trump administration, said Kelly Ryerson, an influencer and former investment banker who attended the meeting with Mr. Zeldin. A loose confederation that brings together some people on the environmental left and the libertarian right, the movement has rallied around three primary issues: “health freedom,” including skepticism of vaccines and opposition to vaccine mandates; healthy eating; and reducing exposure to toxic chemicals. In October, a KFF/Washington Post survey of nearly 3,000 parents found that about 38 percent identified as supporters of the MAHA movement. That figure rose to 62 percent among parents who identified as Republican, and to 81 percent among parents who identified as MAGA Republicans.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT When President George W. Bush began preparing the country for the invasion of Iraq, he traveled the country making the case that Saddam Hussein’s government, and its weapons, posed an unacceptable threat to the United States. Speaking in Cincinnati’s Union Terminal one October night in 2002, he warned that Iraq could attack the United States “on any given day” with chemical or biological weapons. He compared the urgency of the moment to the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, declaring doing nothing was “the riskiest of all options.” Most of Mr. Bush’s arguments turned out to be fanciful, based on selective intelligence and in some cases outright false claims. The war that followed is now considered by many historians as one of the gravest American strategic errors of modern times. But if Mr. Bush made a false case, President Trump, facing a decision about whether to unleash a second major military assault on Iran in less than a year, has made almost no case at all. With two carrier groups and dozens of fighter jets, bombers and refueling aircraft now massing within striking distance of Iran , Mr. Trump is threatening another attack. He is doing so without providing assessments about the urgency of the threat or any explanation of why he needs to strike again after claiming the nuclear sites he targeted had been “obliterated.” Though Mr. Trump is largely fixated on the nuclear weapons program, at various moments he and his aides have cited a range of other rationales for military action: protecting the protesters that Iranian forces killed by the thousands last month, wiping out the arsenal of missiles that Iran can use to strike Israel, and ending Tehran’s support for Hamas and Hezbollah. Then there is the question of whether military force, the hammer Mr. Trump reaches for so quickly, can even accomplish those ends. Most of Iran’s near-bomb-grade uranium is already buried from the last strike , in June. And it is not clear how airstrikes would immediately aid protesters around the country or persuade Iran to stop funding terror. Mr. Trump has never consistently described his goals, and when he talks about them it is usually in a haze of brief, offhand comments. The president has given no speeches preparing the American public for a strike on a country of about 90 million people, and sought no approval from Congress. He has not explained why he has chosen this moment to confront Iran instead of, for example, North Korea, which in the years after Mr. Trump’s failed negotiations in the first term has expanded its nuclear arsenal to 60 or more warheads, by U.S. intelligence estimates, and is working to demonstrate they can reach the United States. Mr. Trump’s national security strategy did not mention North Korea once. And when pressed on Iran, Mr. Trump regularly deflects questions about whether regime change is his true goal, leaving unclear what kind of end-state he seeks — other than an Iran that can never obtain nuclear weapons. His secretary of state, Marco Rubio, when pressed on the question in testimony in late January, conceded that forcing a leadership change in Iran — something the C.I.A. last accomplished in 1953 — would be “far more complex” than the operation the United States conducted to oust Nicolás Maduro as Venezuela’s president. “You’re talking about a regime that’s in place for a very long time,” he told senators. “So that’s going to require a lot of careful thinking, if that eventuality ever presents itself.” Rarely in modern times has the United States prepared to conduct a major act of war with so little explanation and so little public debate. As Mr. Trump gathered the first meeting of the “Board of Peace” at the White House to discuss the rebuilding of Gaza, he veered briefly into the topic of imminent action in Iran, describing only the vaguest of objectives. “They cannot continue to threaten the stability of the entire region, and they must make a deal,” he said, without describing the scope of that deal. “Bad things will happen if it doesn’t” strike that deal, he said, moving back to the topic of Gaza. There are, of course, huge differences with the Iraq invasion. As in Venezuela, Mr. Trump envisions no ground invasion. That avoids the often-voiced critique of his MAGA base that Mr. Trump is risking another “forever war.” Mr. Trump’s calculus is clearly that the base will tolerate bombing runs, which demonstrate the unmatched power of American forces to destroy from afar, as long as the risk to American lives is limited. And, at the outset of the Iraq invasion, Mr. Bush had the support of a large number of Western allies, starting with Britain. The weekend before the Iraq invasion, Mr. Bush met in the Azores with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and the leaders of Spain and Portugal to issue one last ultimatum to Mr. Hussein and plan for an Iraq that would be “whole, free and at peace,” with its oil reserves protected for the Iraqi people. But in this case, none of the allies appear to be joining with the United States in military planning, except for Israel. Britain’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, held a phone conversation with Mr. Trump on Tuesday, and according to The Times of London , Mr. Starmer refused to let Mr. Trump use British airfield facilities at the Diego Garcia base in the Indian Ocean or a Royal Air Force station in Gloucestershire to conduct any operations against Iran. British officials did not confirm or deny the report, but the next day, Mr. Trump issued a blast against Britain’s pending deal for a 100-year lease on the Diego Garcia base. At least the British were aware of Mr. Trump’s plans. Senior officials representing several of the United States’ closest NATO allies said at the Munich Security Conference last weekend that they had gotten almost no details of American plans from Washington. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive military issues. Several of them expressed deep skepticism that the United States could make a compelling case that military action was needed. In fact, Mr. Trump may well be ignoring one of the first rules of the “Powell Doctrine,” the lessons born of the Vietnam War and developed by Colin Powell when he was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “The essence of the post-Vietnam consensus on the use of force is that the political objective must be clearly articulated,” said Robert S. Litwak, a political scientist at George Washington University who has written extensively on negotiating with Iran. “With Iran, Trump is again breaking with that consensus by offering multiple rationales for this preventive military action, from nonproliferation to protecting protesters to regime change.” In the negotiations, which last took place on Tuesday in Geneva, Mr. Trump’s two lead negotiators — Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner — are pressing the country to permanently give up all ability to enrich uranium. The Iranians, according to officials familiar with the negotiations, say they are willing to suspend the production of nuclear materials, maybe for a decade, but refuse to abandon what they view as a right to enrich nuclear material under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, to which Iran is a signatory. It is also unclear whether the Iranians will allow truly in-depth inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear watchdog. For Mr. Trump, the bar for a comprehensive agreement is high. He must demonstrate that any deal he wins in the next two weeks is far better than what President Barack Obama got in two and a half years of intense negotiation. During his first presidential campaign in 2016, Mr. Trump harshly criticized the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the Obama administration, declaring he would have walked out of the room during the negotiations. In 2018, he pulled out of the accord, calling it “the worst deal ever.” But now he is in something of a diplomatic box. He faces pressure to ",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT President Trump, whose family has done more to profit from the presidency than any other in modern history, complained in an economic speech on Thursday that he was a “schmuck” to donate his presidential salary and falsely claimed that he was the only one to do so. The Constitution mandates that the president receive a salary, but John F. Kennedy and Herbert Hoover donated theirs to charity because they were among the wealthiest to serve in the role. For several years in his first term, Mr. Trump donated his presidential salary, often directing it to government agencies like the National Park Service, but appeared to stop doing so by 2020 , according to his tax returns. “We’ve had wealthy presidents before,” Mr. Trump said in an address in Rome, Ga., on Thursday, before falsely saying that “in the history of our country, there’s never been a president that waived his salary. I’m the only schmuck. I get no credit for it. You know what, I get no credit for it. Nobody writes about it.” He added, “It’s a couple million bucks, it’s not peanuts.” Little is written about Mr. Trump’s $400,000 annual salary. He has aggressively profited from the presidency at a scale that dwarfs his constitutionally-mandated paycheck , embarking on an audacious moneymaking campaign in his second term. The Trump family and its business partners have collected at least $320 million in fees from the sales of just one Trump-branded cryptocurrency. Mr. Trump, his family and his allies have greenlit a yawning list of business ventures that would have once been considered ethically unthinkable. The most lucrative of these has been the Trump cryptocurrency empire — with Mr. Trump and his business partners launching the $TRUMP coin just before his second inauguration. After taking office, the president hosted a private dinner for the top buyers of his crypto coin . Many who have signed deals with Trump family members and companies have business before the government. Figures like Elon Musk and other billionaires aligned with the president have benefited from regulatory decisions that Mr. Trump oversees. Members of Mr. Trump’s cabinet, aides and their families have also benefited from his directing capital investment to specific industries . Mr. Trump has also accepted a luxury jetliner from Qatar , worth an estimated $200 million. Mr. Trump has said that he will use the jet as Air Force One while president, after it is retrofitted at an expected cost of hundreds of millions of dollars, and that it will be transferred to his eventual presidential library after he leaves office in 2029. Ethical experts warn that there could be nothing to stop him from using it as his personal plane and say that the jet violates the Constitution’s Foreign Emoluments Clause against accepting gifts from foreign governments. Mr. Trump has filed multiple lawsuits against the government demanding billions in compensation , claiming that he will donate the proceeds. Because Mr. Trump appointed the leaders of those agencies, it may be up to his own loyalists to determine how to respond.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT President Trump convened the first meeting of his new Board of Peace on Thursday, announcing $7 billion in pledges from nine member countries to rebuild Gaza while offering few details about how Hamas can be disarmed or when Israel might fully withdraw from the Palestinian territory. And in an unexpected foray into European politics that flouted diplomatic protocol, Mr. Trump publicly declared his “complete and total endorsement” for Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, in elections in April. A right-wing populist and immigration hard-liner who attended the peace event in Washington, Mr. Orban is a hero to many pro-Trump conservatives but has struggled in polls ahead of the vote. American presidents sometimes signal their preferences in foreign elections, but it is unusual for one to issue an explicit endorsement, for fear of seeming to meddle in another country’s politics. Mr. Trump said Mr. Orban “does an incredible job on immigration.” Hosting Thursday’s event, Mr. Trump announced that nine of the more than 20 member countries have agreed to contribute to the Gaza rebuilding effort. Several are wealthy Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, which said it would donate $1.2 billion. Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania said they would commit peacekeeping troops to Gaza, while Egypt and Jordan have committed troops to train police there. Mr. Trump also said the United States would contribute $10 billion to the board, without saying where the money would come from or whether Congress had been consulted on the matter. The event was held at the U.S. Institute of Peace building in Washington. The modernist federal building was constructed to house an organization by the same name created by Congress in 1984, and which the Trump administration largely dismantled last year. Mr. Trump’s name has since been added to the building’s facade . The foreign leaders who spoke at the event mixed praise for Mr. Trump with talk of Gaza’s bright future. But the juxtaposition of eye-popping dollar figures and thin policy details was conspicuous. Image President Trump hosted the event at the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington, which the Trump administration largely dismantled last year. Credit... Tierney L. Cross/The New York Times Hamas has still not agreed to disarm, and Israel still occupies much of the devastated territory, which by some estimates will cost $70 billion to rebuild. The promises of money and peacekeepers came with few specifics or timetables. Mr. Trump announced his Board of Peace last fall, saying it would oversee the enactment of an October 2025 cease-fire that his administration had brokered between Israel and Hamas. A United Nations Security Council resolution later authorized the body to “set the framework, and coordinate funding for, the redevelopment of Gaza.” But Mr. Trump — who celebrates himself as a peacemaker with inflated claims about having “stopped” eight wars worldwide — has since suggested grander ambitions for the board. “I think it’s going to go far beyond Gaza,” he told reporters on Monday. “I think it’ll be based all over.” During Thursday’s event he went even further, suggesting that the board might one day supersede the United Nations itself. In the future, he said, “the Board of Peace is going to almost be looking over the United Nations and making sure it runs properly.” (Mr. Trump actually spoke positively overall about the United Nations, which even many diplomats concede is often ineffective in the face of global conflict, saying he wanted to strengthen the global body. “We’re going to make sure the United Nations is viable,” he said, promising to “help them, moneywise.”) Many major U.S. allies, including western European powers, have declined to join Mr. Trump’s board. They include France, which did not send a representative to Thursday’s event. A spokesperson for France’s foreign ministry complained about the “ambiguity” of the board’s scope, saying that it must “refocus on the situation in Gaza.” But in his remarks at the event, Secretary of State Marco Rubio echoed the idea that the board’s scope was in fact widening. Mr. Rubio said the body was formed because the “Gaza situation was impossible to solve under orthodoxy, under existing structures.” But, he added, “We hope that this can serve as a model for other complex and difficult situations, so they can be solved in the same way.” The event had more than one unusual detour. In addition to Mr. Trump’s endorsement of Mr. Orban, Prime Minister Edi Rama of Albania used his brief speaking slot to denounce the indictment by a special international tribunal in The Hague of Kosovo’s former president, Hashim Thaci, on charges of crimes against humanity committed during Kosovo’s war for independence more than 25 years ago. Mr. Thaci’s indictment was delivered by Jack Smith, a federal prosecutor who was then the tribunal’s chief prosecutor. Mr. Smith later oversaw the Justice Department’s 2023 indictments of Mr. Trump on charges of election interference and mishandling classified documents. Without mentioning Mr. Smith by name, Mr. Rama made sure Mr. Trump was aware of the connection, saying that Mr. Thaci’s indictment was “the doing of the very same sicario prosecutor that went after President Trump himself, and for that became worldwide famous.” Sicario is a Spanish word and Hollywood movie title that can connote thuggishness or criminality.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT After Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States and much of the West all but severed economic ties to Moscow. But since President Trump took office more than a year ago, he has described a “tremendous opportunity” for deals with Russia if the war ends, and the Kremlin has dangled possible investments in front of the famously transactional leader. Now a Texas investor with ties to the Trump family is testing the possibility of making deals with Russian companies, even as the fighting in Ukraine rages on. The investor, Gentry Beach, said that he quietly signed an agreement with one of Russia’s biggest energy companies last fall to develop natural gas in Alaska. Image Gentry Beach in New York in 2018. Credit... Bennett Raglin/Getty Images for GQ Mr. Beach’s deal, which he insisted was motivated by business interests and not politics, shows how Mr. Trump is starting to bring Russia back into the Western economic fold, even as few signs point to President Vladimir V. Putin being ready to stop his assault on Ukraine and U.S. sanctions against Russia remain in place. It also shows how the Kremlin’s messaging about what it says are immense business opportunities in Russia — an aide to Mr. Putin this week put their value at an improbable $14 trillion — is starting to resonate in the United States. “Trump is a transactional president,” Mr. Beach said in an interview. “I don’t think people would have felt as comfortable working with Russian companies during the Biden administration as they do during the Trump administration.” The project is in its early stages and faces steep hurdles, and Mr. Beach declined to disclose the financial details. The Russian company, Novatek, said it was “indeed having negotiations on the potential use” of its technology to liquefy natural gas in remote northern Alaska. But it did not confirm that it was working with Mr. Beach. Image A concrete gravity-based structure, part of Novatek’s Arctic LNG 2 joint venture, under construction near Belokamenka, Russia, in 2022. Credit... Reuters Mr. Beach’s deal could represent the first known instance of an American investor formalizing a new business venture with a major Russian company since the Kremlin started promoting deal-making opportunities to the Trump administration a year ago. Overall, U.S. companies have remained deeply skeptical of doing business with Russia, and the Trump administration imposed significant new sanctions on Russia’s oil industry last fall. But Mr. Trump, despite voicing occasional frustration with Mr. Putin, has often echoed the Kremlin’s talking points, both on Russia’s economic promise and on the idea that President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is standing in the way of peace. He said last week that Russia “wants to make a deal” to end the war, and that “Zelensky is going to have to get moving.” Mr. Beach said he negotiated his deal in meetings in Dubai and Europe last year with Novatek’s billionaire chief executive, Leonid Mikhelson, who is under sanctions in the U.K. and Canada but not in the United States or the European Union. “It’s time for all of us to work together,” Mr. Beach said, describing himself as a “bringer of peace.” Image Leonid Mikhelson, right, the chief executive of Novatek, in Saint Petersburg, Russia, in 2022. Credit... Olga Maltseva/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Mr. Beach, a hedge fund and private equity investor, is a college friend of Donald Trump Jr.’s, the president’s eldest son, and served as a finance vice chairman for Mr. Trump’s 2017 inauguration. His pursuit of deals around the world since Mr. Trump’s re-election has sowed confusion about his ties to the administration and frustrated Donald Trump Jr., The Wall Street Journal reported last fall . Speaking to The New York Times last week, Mr. Beach said the relationship with Donald Trump Jr. played no role in the Novatek deal, and said he did not “do any business with the Trumps on any level.” He said that his effort was not part of the U.S.-Russia talks led by Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s peace envoy. But Mr. Beach also said that “this project is known about at the highest levels” in Moscow and Washington. He said he would soon announce the names of executives who would lead the project. Last August, days after meeting Mr. Trump in Alaska, Mr. Putin said that “we are discussing with our American partners” the possibility of using Novatek technology to produce liquefied natural gas in Alaska. Doug Burgum, the interior secretary, said in October that foreign investors were interested in exporting the gas directly from Alaska’s North Slope. Mr. Mikhelson, one of Russia’s richest men, has kept a low profile since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, but met regularly with Mr. Putin before then, according to the Kremlin’s website. Novatek, which has close ties to the Kremlin but is not state-controlled, is under partial U.S. sanctions, and some of its subsidiaries face more severe restrictions. Mr. Beach said he had been able to legally pursue his deal because the United States did not fully sanction the Novatek parent company itself. Kirill Dmitriev, Mr. Putin’s economic envoy, has pitched a multitude of potential deals to Mr. Witkoff and other interlocutors, including jointly selling gas to Europe and building an undersea tunnel from Russia to Alaska. Many U.S. companies scrambled to pull out of their business dealings with Russia after Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, facing intensifying Western sanctions and political pressure. Under Mr. Trump, that pressure has eased. Last spring, Mr. Trump described Russia’s economic potential as a “tremendous opportunity.” But while the Kremlin was eager to re-establish business ties, Mr. Trump said that major deal-making would only be possible after Russia stopped its war in Ukraine. That is why Mr. Beach’s deal could mark a milestone, especially as the U.S.-mediated Ukraine peace talks drag on. Mr. Beach said he was not waiting to jump into deal-making with Russia, because “the guy that’s early to the opportunity is usually the one I’ve found that makes the money.” Most of the American corporate world, which once saw Russia as a hot emerging market with a growing middle class, remains skeptical about returning to the country because of the political uncertainty and the limited potential gains. Ivan Grek, the director of George Washington University’s Russia program, said that Mr. Beach’s project could be an early test of whether new U.S.-Russia deals are realistic. He said he also saw interest in doing more business with Russia from medical technology, pharmaceutical and consumer goods companies. “Gentry is a pioneer in this case, if not the only pioneer,” said Mr. Grek, who has been convening discussions among officials, businesspeople and academics on economic policy toward Russia. Mr. Beach’s project would tackle an enduring conundrum for the U.S. energy industry: how to sell the huge amount of natural gas produced in the slice of tundra near Alaska’s Arctic Ocean coastline known as the North Slope. But it still faces major obstacles, including securing the participation of larger energy companies that would supply gas to the project. It could also compete with Trump-backed plans for an 800-mile pipeline to send North Slope gas to southern Alaska , where it could be liquefied and exported. Mr. Beach argued that his project would be complementary to the pipeline. The project would echo the approach Novatek has developed for shipping gas from the remote Russian Arctic: turning it into liquefied natural gas in a prefabricated plant and transporting it out by icebreaker. Novatek said in its statement that the climate in the Alaskan Arctic was similar. “Experts have discussed this opportunity for many years,” Novatek’s statement went on. “Having said that, all the arrangements can only be implemented subject to support from the Russian and U.S. authorities.” Mr. Beach described Mr. Mikhelson, the bil",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Democrats have selected Gov. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia to deliver their party’s response to President Trump’s State of the Union address on Tuesday, putting at center stage a former congresswoman who flipped a red seat to blue ahead of midterm elections in which they are expecting to win back control of the House. Ms. Spanberger won the governorship in a purple state last November by 15 points, a victory that buoyed Democrats and offered a glint of hope for the future of a party that has struggled to formulate an effective response to a president unbound. In 2018, she became the first Democrat in 50 years to win Virginia’s Seventh Congressional District , to the north of Richmond. Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, chose her for the response, people familiar with his thinking said, because he believes that her gubernatorial campaign, which focused on affordability and prosecuting the case against Mr. Trump, was a model for how Democrats can win races across the country in November. Ms. Spanberger said she planned to use her speech to address the issues facing Americans at a pivotal moment: “rising costs, chaos in their communities, and a real fear of what each day might bring.” The choice of Ms. Spanberger, 46, a moderate Democrat and former undercover C.I.A. officer , in some ways followed the same playbook the party used last year when they selected Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, a relatively young, centrist female lawmaker with national security credentials, to deliver the response to Mr. Trump’s speech to a joint session of Congress. Unlike Ms. Slotkin, however, Ms. Spanberger is not seen as a potential presidential candidate in 2028. Still, the job of the televised response is often seen as a springboard for an up-and-coming lawmaker to boost his or her political profile. It can also be a delicate assignment, one that has been botched by so many promising elected officials in both parties that it is now considered almost cursed. Senator Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat and minority leader, also announced on Thursday that he had chosen Senator Alex Padilla of California, the first Latino elected to represent his state in the Senate, to deliver the Spanish-language response to the speech. Mr. Padilla, the son of Mexican immigrants, last year was shoved to the ground by federal agents and handcuffed after trying to ask Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, a question at a news conference in downtown Los Angeles.

The order comes as district court judges across the country whose dockets are swamped with petitions from immigrants challenging their detention have been increasingly muscular in their response to the executive branch disregarding their orders, compiling lists of violations and in one instance holding a Justice Department lawyer in civil contempt of court . Judge Sykes, who was appointed by President Joseph R. Biden Jr., criticized the executive branch in strong terms, referring to its “terror against noncitizens,” “unlawful, wanton acts,” and “violence on its own citizens” in killing two Minnesota residents. A Homeland Security Department spokesman responded to the ruling by criticizing “judicial activists.” In a statement, the spokesman said that Immigration and Customs Enforcement “has the law and the facts on its side” and that “it adheres to all court decisions until it ultimately gets them shot down by the highest court in the land.” The ruling was praised by Matt Adams, legal director for Northwest Immigrant Rights Project and one of the attorneys representing the petitioners in the case. He said the ruling “appropriately calls out the D.O.J. for defying the court’s prior orders,” adding that he hoped that the petitioners and other detainees who could benefit from the suit “will now finally receive the bond hearings they are entitled to.” A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment. The government has indicated it plans to appeal Judge Sykes’s rulings. In court, Justice Department lawyers have said that their lapses are unintentional as they struggle to keep up with an overwhelming caseload. The Trump administration has been arresting and detaining immigrants who have settled in the United States after entering the country illegally, a break with the longstanding practice of releasing many on bond . As a result, the federal district courts have been flooded with petitions from detained immigrants who are challenging the legality of the new approach. In her opinion, Judge Sykes dismissed excuses that government lawyers were overwhelmed, noting the flood of work was ultimately driven by the administration’s policies. Officials “have chosen to avail themselves of these exact circumstances of which they now complain,” she wrote. The administration has been repeatedly sued over its practice of holding migrants who have lived for years in the United States without bond. The legal question of whether the detentions are justified turns on whether detainees already inside the United States can be held without bond under a statute that authorizes such detention for “applicants for admission.” But even if that statute does apply, some detainees’ lawyers have argued , they may still be entitled to a hearing under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. Some district court judges and one divided appellate panel from the conservative Fifth Circuit have agreed the administration’s actions were legal. Judge Sykes is among the dozens of federal judges who have ruled against the Trump administration’s interpretation of the law. In December, she issued a broad ruling that the Homeland Security Department’s arrest policy for migrants was illegal. That order was especially significant because she also certified a nationwide class of potential beneficiaries for her ruling: most anyone without a criminal record who had entered the United States illegally and was not immediately detained at the border. After her ruling, the administration’s chief immigration judge, Teresa L. Riley, issued internal guidance for immigration judges, who are part of the Justice Department. She said that they could continue to order migrants to be detained without bond, relying on a September ruling by a different government group, the Board of Immigration Appeals, that justified the detentions. In her ruling, Judge Sykes wrote that administration officials were “shameless” to argue that they were not bound by her earlier ruling. She declared she was vacating the Board of Immigration Appeals ruling, rendering it void, charging that the government had “far crossed the boundaries of constitutional conduct.” “Somehow, even after the judicial declaration of law that the Department of Homeland Security was misguided in its act of legal interpretation,” she wrote, government officials “still insist they can continue their campaign of illegal action.” Judge Sykes ordered the Homeland Security Department to change its website to let detainees know that they could potentially benefit from her class-action ruling. Within seven days, she wrote, the government must give notices of potential class membership to “all noncitizens already in immigration detention,” presented “in a language the noncitizen understands,” an order that would require providing notice to tens of thousands of detained migrants. She wrote that the government must provide “access to a telephone to call an attorney within one hour” of receiving the notice.

Cross/The New York Times Supported by SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Listen to this article · 4:22 min Learn more Share full article By Shawn McCreesh Shawn McCreesh is a White House correspondent. He reported from Washington. Feb. 19, 2026 President Trump emceed the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace in Washington on Thursday morning. It’s a new international body he created and oversees. Nations willing to pay $1 billion can purchase a permanent seat on the board. The big news out of the meeting was that the president promised the United States would put up $10 billion in aid to Gaza. Where this money would come from or whether it had been approved by Congress, he did not say. White House officials did not respond to requests for comment. Some other nations pledged aid money, too. Beyond that, there were few clear objectives from the meeting. It was like the United Nations General Assembly, if everything about the United Nations revolved around Donald Trump. He told tall tales. Cracked old jokes. Got people to pay money into something he’s named after himself. Hyped up his wife’s movie. Trashed his enemies. Aired familiar grievances. Congratulated himself. Brought along top members of his government and then kicked back while they congratulated him. Image Flanked by world leaders, Mr. Trump cracked jokes, bragged about his wife’s movie and aired familiar grievances. Credit... Tierney L. Cross/The New York Times So much about the meeting was highly unorthodox. To begin with, there was the timing. Mr. Trump was hosting this meeting just as he was moving a mighty array of military hardware into place near Iran. He used his peace summit to threaten all-out war. “Bad things will happen” if Iran doesn’t make a deal with him about its nuclear program, he warned. “You’re going to be finding out over the next probably 10 days.” Also, there was the location. The Trump-led Board of Peace met at the Donald J. Trump United States Institute of Peace (it’s just down the street from the Donald J. Trump and John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts). “Marco named it after me,” Mr. Trump explained about the venue while his secretary of state sat a few feet away. “I had nothing to do with it, I swear I didn’t. I swear. I had no idea.” And there was the very nature of the thing. What is the Board of Peace, really? To see it come together for the first time is to understand it as a manifestation of a Trump World Order. None of America’s old mates wanted anything to do with it. Leaders from Britain, France, Canada, Germany, Norway and other places the president has spent a year insulting stayed away. Their absence was clocked by the peacemeister. “Almost everybody’s accepted, and the ones that haven’t will be,” he claimed. “Some are playing a little cute. Doesn’t work. You can’t play cute with me.” Image Some longtime American allies like Britain, France and Canada were notably absent from the Board of Peace gathering. Credit... Tierney L. Cross/The New York Times There was a funny little note in his voice then. Was it self-consciousness? “The ones that aren’t here are watching on Zoom,” he said. The president had nice things to say about the ones who did want to join his club. “This is the most prestigious board ever put together,” he proclaimed. “You know, I’ve seen some great corporate boards. I’ve seen some great boards, period. It’s peanuts compared to this board.” In the immortal words of Megadeth : Peace sells … but who’s buying? Morocco, Egypt, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Indonesia and Vietnam all accepted invitations to join the Board of Peace. Mr. Trump shouted out some other leaders. “We are honored to be joined by Prime Minister Rama of Albania,” he said. “Where is President Milei?” he asked, spotting the Argentine leader. “Prime Minister Hun Manet of Cambodia, raise your hand, wherever you may be.” Prime Minister Hun Manet raised his hand. “Yeah, hi,” Mr. Trump said. Santiago Peña, the 47-year-old president of Paraguay, caught Mr. Trump’s eye. “Young, handsome guy,” he said. “It’s always nice to be young and handsome. Doesn’t mean we have to like you. I don’t like young, handsome men. Women, I like. Men? I don’t have any interest. Ha, ha.” Capeesh? Image Vice President JD Vance and other top officials joined Mr. Trump onstage. Credit... Tierney L. Cross/The New York Times There was some light U.N.-bashing at this first meeting of the Anti-U.N. “The Board of Peace is going to almost be looking over the United Nations and making sure it runs properly,” Mr. Trump said. He recounted how the last time he spoke at the U.N., his teleprompter was busted and the elevator broke down. And of course, there was venting of grievances about the Nobel Prize. “I got screwed by Norway,” Mr. Trump said. There was a PowerPoint presentation and a video of Gazans interspersed with B-roll footage of Mr. Trump walking around and shaking hands. The president banged a miniature golden gavel, and with that, the first meeting of the Board of Peace was adjourned.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Refugees who were lawfully admitted to the United States could be arrested if they have not yet obtained a green card, a change to previous policy that is the Trump administration’s latest effort to scrutinize immigrants who were approved for status. In a new memo, which was described in court filings on Wednesday, officials at the Department of Homeland Security said immigration agents would be required to detain refugees if they had not applied for legal permanent status after a year of living in the country. Refugees would be “inspected and examined for admission to the United States” after being detained, according to the memo, which was issued on Wednesday by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. It was unclear how long refugees could be kept in detention. According to the memo, they would be confined for “the reasonable length of time it takes” to re-examine their cases. The memo is part of the Trump administration’s broad effort to target refugees and tighten pathways for immigrants to legally enter or remain in the United States. Last month, the Homeland Security Department announced that it would review thousands of refugee cases in Minnesota, requiring them to submit to new interviews and background checks amid a surge of federal immigration enforcement in the state. In the following weeks, at least 100 refugees were arrested in Minnesota and sent to detention centers in Texas for interviews, lawyers, family members and faith leaders said. A federal judge later ordered immigration agents to stop detaining and deporting refugees in Minnesota and to immediately release those held for re-examination of their cases. On Thursday, a federal judge will hear arguments on whether to extend those temporary protections. That judge’s order came after the Trump administration slashed the number of refugees accepted into the country. In October, the administration lowered the ceiling of refugee admissions to 7,500 for this fiscal year, down from the 125,000 cap the Biden administration had set the previous year. Federal officials also said they would prioritize slots for mostly white South Africans . The new policy rescinds an Obama-era memo that had previously determined that a refugee’s failure to apply for legal permanent status within a year was not sufficient grounds to detain or deport them. In a statement, a Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesperson said the agency was enforcing immigration laws that required the federal government to inspect refugees after their first year in the United States. “The memo almost reads like they think they have an obligation to detain refugees who don’t have green cards after one year of being in the United States, which is a wild interpretation because refugees can’t even apply for green cards until after a year,” said Sarah Pierce, a former policy analyst at Citizenship and Immigration Services who is now the director of social policy at the center-left think tank Third Way. “This is just yet another policy that’s being driven by removal numbers.” Ms. Pierce added that the Trump administration’s pause on immigration applications filed by people from countries subject to the president’s travel ban would also make it harder for at least some refugees to obtain green cards. Federal officials said the new directive was necessary to root out people with serious criminal backgrounds, identify those who posed national security risks and ensure that refugees did not fraudulently obtain lawful status. Groups that provide assistance to refugees swiftly condemned the memo, saying it could strip the legal status of immigrants who had already been extensively vetted and welcomed into the United States after fleeing persecution. They also said they expected more refugees to be deported as a result of the efforts. “This government will clearly stop at nothing to terrorize refugee communities, and really all immigrants, while trampling over our constitutional rights,” Laurie Ball Cooper, the vice president for U.S. legal programs at the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in a statement. Immigrant advocacy groups said they expected the directive to largely affect recently arrived refugees. In the 2024 fiscal year alone, more than 100,000 refugees were admitted to the United States, according to data from the Department of Homeland Security.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Mothers of young children surged into the work force during the Covid-19 pandemic, propelled by a tight labor market, federal child care subsidies and the sudden abundance of remote jobs. Years later, they are still on the job. The share of women with children under 5 who are working or looking for work peaked at nearly 71 percent in September 2023 and continues to float above prepandemic levels, according to an analysis of government data from the Hamilton Project , an economic policy research group at the Brookings Institution. The growth is partly because more employers have flexible office policies, an enduring legacy of the pandemic era. More jobs are at least partly remote, so parents — especially mothers who often shoulder most of their families’ child care duties — can better balance their responsibilities as employees and caregivers. This is particularly true for highly educated women in white-collar jobs. There is probably also a bleaker catalyst for the elevated labor force participation among mothers with young children, some economists believe: More women feel they must earn a paycheck to afford family life . “It’s not something to be proud of,” said Kathryn Anne Edwards, a labor economist and policy consultant. “If anything, it just reflects that they might be more desperate for money.” For families across the country, the cost of living has become an escalating challenge . Grocery prices have increased more than 25 percent over the past five years. Many Americans are straining to pay for health care, education and housing. Child care prices in most states have increased more than twice as fast as prices overall, according to the Century Foundation , a left-leaning think tank. The financial pressure may be compelling more mothers of young children, who generally work less than other women in their prime working years, to enter and remain in the labor force. Hiring in January was stronger than expected , the Labor Department reported on Wednesday. Kelsey Whitlatch, a mother of two in Moundsville, W.Va., left her job as a hairstylist in October 2023, a month before her second son was born. A year later, she got a job at a day care, but it closed soon after. Ms. Whitlatch, 28, said she considered not working to focus on her children, who are now 5 and 2. But her husband, a bridge inspector for the state, does not make enough money to support their family on his own, especially with the rising costs of groceries and utilities. During months when she wasn’t working, her family relied on food stamps and struggled to pay bills. She fell so behind on payments for her car that she worried it would be repossessed. “We were going under so bad,” she said. She now brings home about $400 a week taking care of a handful of children along with another mother who had worked at the day care. She also has a business, Sugar Mommas Cottage Home Bakery, that sells cookies and elaborately frosted cakes. “Every day I’m grateful — I know we could definitely be way worse,” she said. “I’m glad we’re at least sustaining, to some extent.” Image During months when Ms. Whitlatch wasn’t working, her family relied on food stamps and struggled to pay bills. Credit... Rebecca Kiger for The New York Times Mothers of young children have a lower labor force participation rate than other women for many reasons, including a lack of affordable child care and caregiving duties that are in tension with work schedules. Women who drop out of the labor force tend to do so around the time when their children are born, and rejoin when their children are older and parenting responsibilities are less consuming. The labor force participation rate for mothers with children ages 5 to 12 was about 77 percent at the end of last year. But being a stay-at-home mother for any amount of time is possible only if a family can live on one income. That arrangement appears increasingly out of reach. More than 70 percent of Americans last year said raising children was unaffordable, according to the American Family Survey , an annual poll of 3,000 Americans. “What is noticeable is just how widespread this concern is,” said Chris Karpowitz, a political science professor at Brigham Young University and one of the survey’s authors. “Americans of all stripes are worried about the cost of raising kids.” Poorer families are being squeezed even harder by slower wage growth, persistent inflation and rising child care costs, said Corinne Low, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of “Having It All: What Data Tells Us About Women’s Lives and Getting the Most Out of Yours.” That, coupled with a downshift in hiring, has made many families more reliant on second “flex” earners to pick up the slack. “One of the things that means is families might not be able to afford not having Mom in the labor market,” she said. Other factors keeping more women with young children in the labor force include a change in employers’ expectations about where work is done. White-collar professions are often more conducive to remote-work arrangements, and many companies have become less strict about in-person work. That has allowed some women to set office schedules that align more with child care hours. Women have also benefited from a boom in the health care industry, which has powered employment growth. More than 40 percent of the 2.8 million jobs created from November 2023 to November 2025 were held by women in health care and social assistance, according to an Indeed Hiring Lab analysis of government data. Roles such as nursing, though often in person, have set shifts that allow mothers to more reliably anticipate their child care needs, Dr. Low said. “It works for women because it is structured and it is predictable and it has strong boundaries,” she said. Efforts are underway in New Mexico, New York City and elsewhere to make child care more accessible, which could bolster the labor force participation rate for mothers with young children. Yet a shortage in affordable child care is a prevailing obstacle. Pandemic-era child care subsidies have expired. The federal government is trying to freeze roughly $10 billion in funding for child care and social services destined for New York, California, Minnesota, Illinois and Colorado, which are all led by Democrats. And evidence is emerging that the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown is shrinking the supply of child care workers, worsening the problem.

She and her husband, an electrician, have cut down their expenses but are still struggling to pay roughly $550 a month to send their daughter to preschool. They have been trying to sell their house and downsize, but have not had any luck. With another baby on the way, Ms. Hulin and her husband decided it made sense for her to become a stay-at-home mother rather than pay for child care for two children. She plans to leave her job in child advocacy at a nonprofit in May, when her daughter’s program ends for the summer. “It’s hard stepping away from something I enjoy,” she said. But she added, “My purpose is going to be fulfilled still, being there with my kids.” Sydney Ember is a Times business reporter, covering the U.S. economy and the labor market.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT President Trump has frequently claimed that foreign countries were paying for his tariffs, not Americans. But as economists predicted, that is largely turning out not to be the case. Research published on Thursday by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Columbia University suggests that, through November 2025, 90 percent of the economic burden of the president’s tariffs fell on U.S. companies and consumers. The economists reviewed the “incidence” of the tariffs — who ultimately pays the cost of new import taxes . When a good is brought into the country, the importer of record, often an American company, is first responsible for paying the tariff to the U.S. government. But the importer can pass that cost on to others by raising the prices it charges its customers, or by negotiating more favorable contracts with its suppliers. Mr. Trump and his advisers have said the cost of tariffs would be shouldered by foreign suppliers. They believed that foreign companies would respond to tariffs by reducing their prices, to maintain their access to the large and important U.S. consumer market. In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal on Jan. 30 defending his tariffs, Mr. Trump wrote, “the data shows that the burden, or ‘incidence,’ of the tariffs has fallen overwhelmingly on foreign producers and middlemen, including large corporations that are not from the U.S.” “In many cases, nations that are heavily dependent on exports have had no choice but to ‘eat’ the tariffs to avoid even worse losses from their excess capacity,” he added, appearing to incorrectly interpret some statistics. Although data shows foreign suppliers react to tariffs by reducing their prices in some instances, economic research suggests that is not the most common response. The New York Fed study found that, from January 2024 to November 2025, the bulk of the tariff costs fell on U.S. firms and consumers. In the first eight months of 2025, 94 percent of the tariff incidence was borne by the United States, they said. “In sum, U.S. firms and consumers continue to bear the bulk of the economic burden of the high tariffs imposed in 2025,” the study found. The same researchers studied the effect of tariffs in Mr. Trump’s first term, where they found that tariffs in 2018 and 2019 were wholly passed on to American businesses and consumers. Businesses across the country have spent the last year trying to navigate Mr. Trump’s changing tariff policies. Larger companies have generally been able to handle the higher import duties without raising prices significantly on consumers. In some cases, their size helped them to negotiate discounts with suppliers who rely on their business, helping to offset the cost of the tariffs. Because they often have a more diversified roster of suppliers, they could more easily shift production to countries that carried lower tariff rates. China’s share of U.S. imports — which slumped when Mr. Trump waged a trade war on the county in his first term — fell further last year. But U.S. imports from Mexico and Vietnam increased to help make up the difference. But many bigger companies stockpiled inventory before the tariffs took effect, allowing them to keep prices relatively stable. Some have also accepted smaller profit margins in the hopes that the Trump administration would reach more favorable trade deals eventually. For smaller businesses, tariffs have been a bigger drag . Many did not have the clout to arrange deals with foreign suppliers. Because they typically operate with smaller profit margins, they couldn’t swallow the additional expenses for long. Some had to raise prices on consumers or risk going under. Still, the impact of tariffs has been smaller than many economists anticipated, in part because many companies feared that raising prices would drive away customers. Tariffs have lifted prices on some imported goods, but for the most part, prices have not ballooned. Who bears the brunt of the tariffs could evolve. Many companies delayed some shipments as they worked through pre-tariff inventory, pushing off the tariffs’ costs and allowing them to defer some decisions about how to manage the additional duties. As stockpiles become depleted, avoidance will no longer be an option. The researchers at the New York Fed found that foreign suppliers started to bear a greater proportion of the tariff costs by the end of the year, likely as U.S. companies began renegotiating their contracts. Still, in November, 86 percent of the tariff cost was still passing through to the United States. Over the year, the average tariff rate on U.S. imports rose to 13 percent from 2.6 percent, the economists said, spiking in April and May as Mr. Trump applied tariffs to exports from foreign countries, including China. Their findings imply that, overall, U.S. import prices for goods rose 11 percent because of the tariffs. Ana Swanson covers trade and international economics for The Times and is based in Washington.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT President Trump’s seizure of Venezuela’s oil and his on-again, off-again vows to acquire Greenland , by force if necessary, have underscored the new threat that Washington poses to nations’ sovereignty. The land and resource grabs have alarmed even once-close allies, compelling them to consider other, less obvious risks. The most pointed stems from American dominance over the global financial networks and technology systems that undergird nearly every purchase or exchange of information made by citizens, businesses and governments. Allies are concerned for their financial independence and the security of confidential national data. The risks may be harder to visualize than crashing through a nation’s border and carting off its valuable crude. But they have revived efforts, particularly in Europe, to strengthen control over these critical, though unseen, sources of autonomy and power. European leaders have stepped up their push to reduce reliance on big American tech firms like Amazon, Google and Microsoft for cloud computing, and on financial services titans like Mastercard and Visa for payment systems. The move to secure what are being labeled monetary sovereignty and digital sovereignty is part of a broader effort to reduce Europe’s dependence on American weapons, trade, technology and more. At a summit in Belgium this week, President Emmanuel Macron of France warned that the reliance makes the continent more vulnerable to economic and political coercion from the White House, and he urged other European leaders to seize “the Greenland moment” to do something about it. Economists and bankers have also been urging lawmakers to approve the creation of a digital euro — the online version of cash — to lessen dependence on American financial service companies and networks. Image President Emmanuel Macron of France at a summit in Belgium, where he warned about Europe’s technological dependence. Credit... Virginia Mayo/Associated Press “Trump was elected and everyone started getting very, very scared,” said Dan Davies, formerly an economist at the Bank of England. Europeans woke up to Mr. Trump’s willingness to use their needs to squeeze Europe and realized “now this is obviously a national security issue.” Nearly two-thirds of the transactions in countries that use the euro, the second-most commonly used currency in global trade, were handled by Mastercard or Visa in 2025, according to the European Central Bank. And at least 13 European nations, including Austria, Spain and Ireland, have no nationally controlled option for in-store or online digital payments. The issue gained urgency as leaders began to consider that powerful tools that Washington once reserved for adversaries like Russia and Iran could be turned on them. The risk is rising that Europe could “lose control over the most fundamental element in our economy: our money,” 70 prominent economists and other experts wrote in a letter to the European Parliament last month. Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, has pointed to Mr. Trump’s decision to impose sanctions on judges and prosecutors at the International Criminal Court for investigating whether Israel committed war crimes in Gaza. Mr. Trump’s action effectively cut off their access to digital and financial services, including credit cards. And because the executive order barred U.S. companies from providing services to those listed, the chief prosecutor’s email account provided by Microsoft was turned off. Image Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, has warned that U.S. sanctions threaten Europe’s financial sovereignty. Credit... Frederick Florin/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The move set off shudders among government and security officials throughout Europe as an illustration of Mr. Trump’s quickness to leverage America’s financial and tech dominance to punish opponents even in allied countries. “That gives you one very specific example of how we are not effectively sovereign in our own garden,” Ms. Lagarde said in an interview with The Financial Times. The Trump administration’s embrace of stablecoins and cryptocurrencies has only ratcheted up concerns in the European Union about control of the euro. Worries about the integrity of sensitive and private information, too, are rising. Legislation passed by Congress in recent years, including changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and a law known as the CLOUD Act, gives the U.S. government additional powers to spy on foreigners’ communications without a warrant and to force American companies to hand over data from anywhere around the globe. Mr. Trump has also threatened the 27-member European Union with tariffs if it tries to regulate or tax American tech firms. The risk of “exposing our scientific exchanges, sensitive data and strategic innovations to non-European actors” prompted the French government to order all state workers to stop using the American-owned video platform Zoom and switch to a homegrown alternative, Visio. Municipalities in Germany, Denmark and France have also been shifting from American-owned systems to European or other alternatives.

The Netherlands had hired Solvinity, a Dutch cloud company, to operate its national digital identity system. But in November, the firm announced an agreement to be acquired by the American multinational Kyndryl. European leaders have vowed to spend billions to build cloud computing infrastructure and develop artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Reducing dependence on American tech or financial services firms is easier said than done. The banking industry in Europe, which is developing private payment alternatives, has opposed a digital euro, and so have far-right political parties, citing concerns about privacy and economic centralization. As for digital technologies, at least 80 percent of Europe’s are imported, according to a recent report by European Digital SME Alliance, a trade group. In 2013, Europe controlled about 22 percent of the global market for information and communications technology. By 2022, it was only about 11 percent. Many European leaders see artificial intelligence as an area where Europe can thrive. But the region has fallen far behind the United States and China in building the most cutting-edge systems. In countries like Britain, Germany, Spain and Norway, many of the biggest A.I. projects are being spearheaded in partnership with American tech firms, which have vowed to spend hundreds of billions on new data centers and other infrastructure. “The computational divide has become a chasm,” warned a report published by Oxford University and other research groups. Microsoft, Apple and Google, which have major customer bases in Europe, have tried to reassure governments in the region that they can be trusted. Yet many have been left questioning how the companies would respond to national security orders made by the U.S. government. “If they are asked by the U.S. administration to hand over data, which can be sensitive data, they may not be in a position to say no,” said Andrea Renda, an expert on digital policy at CEPS, a think tank in Brussels, and an adviser to European Union officials. Constance de Leusse, executive director of the A.I. and Society Institute in France, said all involved might be hurt as the ties between important allies eroded. “The race to dominate by the U.S. and for autonomy on the European side may hurt everyone,” she said. “It feels like a losing game for both sides.” A correction was made on Feb. 12, 2026 : An earlier version of this article misstated the status of Kyndryl’s acquisition of Solvinity. An agreement was announced in November, but the acquisition is not yet complete. When we learn of a mistake, w",

Feb. 12, 2026 A popular knock on Orange County, Calif., is that it is a mass of indistinguishable neighborhoods designed for the efficient placement of tract homes. But a few miles down the highway from Disneyland, smack in center of the county, lies a subtle refutation of sprawl-style growth. The city is Irvine, population 300,000 or so. On the surface it looks like a typical American suburb with curlicue streets and shopping centers abundant in parking. What makes Irvine unique is that unlike most of its neighbors, it also has a dense base of employment that includes a university, manufacturing and high-rise office buildings — in other words, it is a true city. This happened fast, and not organically. Almost all of Irvine was built by a single entity, the Irvine Company, which for most of its 160-year history was a grain and citrus farming operation. The company started developing this farmland during California’s post-World War II boom, and in the late 1970s was taken over by a group of investors that included Donald Bren. (Bren, 93, is now the sole owner and one of the country’s richest people, thanks to Irvine’s growth.) The company planned most of Irvine’s parks, streets and structures, and it continues to own a majority of the city’s apartments, shopping centers and offices — even a local newspaper . Almost no place in America is more completely a company town. Image A single company planned most of Irvine’s parks, streets and structures. Credit... Matt Gush/Shutterstock As the country grapples with a housing shortage, Irvine’s model has gained a new appeal. What more efficient way to produce homes and expand businesses than building new urban areas on vacant land without the complexities of an existing city? Enticed by the potential profits and eager to have more control over their footprint, investors and businesses are backing new town and city concepts that, like Irvine, are guided by a private hand. Some of the plans are dead serious, others fanciful. Perhaps not surprisingly, their most enthusiastic proponents tend to be technology billionaires. Take, for instance, Starbase, Texas , a newly incorporated city that has clusters of employee housing built around manufacturing and launch facilities owned by SpaceX, Elon Musk’s rocket company. Starbase, which encompasses about 1.5 square miles near the Mexican border , is one of several attempts to use Texas’ abundant land and loose development laws to seed start-up communities with names like Proto-Town and Austantinople . Back in California, a group of Silicon Valley moguls are pursuing something much grander: a proposal to build a city of 400,000 people on top of rolling hills an hour north of San Francisco (at the moment those hills are occupied by sheep farms and wind turbines). California Forever, the company behind the project, has spent about $1 billion acquiring 70,000 acres of farmland and put forth a plan to build a walkable community with nearby manufacturing and shipbuilding facilities. There is, of course, a big difference between declaring an intent to build a whole city and doing it. In 2021, Marc Lore, the billionaire founder of the shopping portal Jet.com, announced Telosa, which is imagined as a desert city of five million people. Lore’s aim is to upend the economics of land use: A foundation would manage development and lease land to residents and businesses (who would own the buildings). Telosa has a small team of employees and consultants, and a website with animations of elevated trams cruising past pedestrian-friendly streets. It has also yet to acquire land, so, for now, is more utopian dream than real-life destination. These efforts might seem kooky if the drive for new cities wasn’t also getting purchase from influential policy minds. The economists Paul M. Romer , a Nobel laureate and professor at Boston College, and Edward L. Glaeser of Harvard have boosted the new city concept in the United States and abroad. At the same time, urbanists are organizing pop-up villages and designing car-lite and even car-free neighborhoods. About a year after the California Forever project was revealed , Devon Zuegel, a software engineer, announced a proposal for a new neighborhood in the Sonoma County city of Cloverdale. The project is called Esmeralda . Esmeralda, which borrows heavily from the new urbanist movement, is slated for a site where the city had earlier approved a golf course neighborhood dotted with large, single-family homes and ample yards. Zuegel’s hope is to execute a kind of planning U-turn. Esmeralda’s ambition is to build 605 higher-density homes with front porches and bike-friendly streets all linked to shops, offices and hotel rooms by walkways and a community plaza. Even the biggest of these projects is tiny compared with new city ideas in the rest of the world. There is nothing to match the scale and hubris of, say, Neom , the $500 billion city that Saudi Arabia hopes will diversify its oil-dependent economy, or the dozens of new cities in Asia whose stock of empty buildings makes them seem both impressive and like a good way to go broke. During his 2024 campaign, President Trump announced his intent to create “ Freedom Cities ” that would be constructed on federal land and “reignite American imagination” by embracing innovations like flying vehicles that take off and land vertically. But as president, he has not offered much of a blueprint, and has instead mostly pushed ideas to allow prospective home buyers to take on more debt . However it happens, America needs more housing. Economists estimate the current shortage at somewhere between four million and seven million units, which would take several decades to build at the current pace of construction. The easiest way to boost those numbers is to build more housing on the urban edge, where land and construction are less expensive. The unifying thesis of projects like California Forever and Esmeralda is to use the logic of sprawl-style growth — build on undeveloped land outside city centers — to create neighborhoods that aim to minimize the use of cars. “When I look around America and I see what’s being built, I have a hard time finding places I want to live,” said Zuegel, the chief executive of Esmeralda. “I’m not thrilled about the idea of raising kids in a city like San Francisco, where it would be hard to have independence at a young age. At the same time, I don’t want to live in a car-centric suburb where you can’t walk to a store.” Open land represents the future in its purest form — after all, every place was no place at some point. The quest for resources, escaping bondage or seeking places to worship freely have all motivated new settlements and fresh modes of living. Buildings, sure, but also a chance to improve society in a place where the future looms larger than the past. “We are trying to create a place that will someday have all the messiness and complexity that real cities have,” said Gabriel Metcalf, the head of planning for California Forever. “The word ‘city’ is an expression of that ambition.” But every idea needs a model. And in the United States, it’s hard to find a more successful one than Irvine. A City Built From Scratch The weekday drive from Los Angeles to Orange County is choked with traffic and rimmed by strip malls. On a recent morning, I made the slog to meet Michael Stockstill, a former employee of the Irvine Company and co-author (with H. Pike Oliver) of “Transforming the Irvine Ranch,” the definitive history of Irvine and its post-World War II transformation. Over the next few hours, Stockstill drove me around while narrating the city’s history. Calling my attention to the absence of billboards",

The U.S. economy put in a strong showing at the start of 2026, following a year of disruptions that depressed both the demand for labor and its supply. Employers added 130,000 jobs in January, the Labor Department reported on Wednesday, in a report delayed from last week by a short government shutdown. The unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent from 4.4 percent a month earlier. The peppier-than-expected data is a sign that the labor market might be emerging from a period of extremely slow growth brought on by a trade war that made companies hesitant to hire, an immigration crackdown that lowered the number of available workers and a federal government firing spree. Annual revisions to earlier data changed the picture of last year. The economy added only 181,000 jobs in 2025, down from an earlier estimate of 584,000. Here’s what else to know: More people working: The labor force participation rate for people in their prime working years, between 25 and 54, jumped to 84.1 percent. That is as high as it’s been since 2001. Narrow growth: As has been the case for more than a year, health care accounted for more than half of job gains in January, adding 82,000 positions. Construction gained 33,000 jobs, but most other sectors were flat, and the federal government shed another 35,000 positions. Working longer: In another sign of strong labor demand, the average workweek edged up by 0.1 hours. That number has been depressed for months, as employers tried to keep people busy even with fewer orders. Wages up: Average hourly earnings rose by 3.7 percent over the year, a pace that has been fairly consistent in recent months. However, that growth has become more stratified, with those on the higher end of the income ladder seeing faster raises . Slow hiring, slower layoffs: Other federal data released last week showed that job openings dropped to 6.5 million in December, the lowest level since September 2020. At the same time, initial claims for unemployment insurance remained very low in January, suggesting that employers are not laying off more people than usual. A seasonal quirk: Sluggish hiring of seasonal workers during the holidays may have boosted the number. If fewer were laid off in January, that would translate into a stronger reading after the Bureau of Labor Statistics adjusts for typical seasonal fluctuations. The Fed has time: The February jobs report is slated to be released before the Federal Reserve meets next to set interest rates, in mid-March. That is, unless another government shutdown delays the report again.

In a post on social media, he described the monthly figure as “FAR GREATER THAN EXPECTED!” before insisting that the United States should “be paying the LOWEST INTEREST RATE, by far.” The president did not address the other key component in today’s release — a steep downward revision to hiring estimates from previous months. An earlier revision prompted Mr. Trump to order the firing of the top official overseeing the labor statistics agency that produces the monthly jobs report. Feb. 11, 2026, 9:50 a.m. ET Talmon Joseph Smith “A year ago, this would have been considered a ‘meh’ employment report. In the current environment, 130,000 print is a blowout number,” said said Samuel Rines, an economist and a macro strategist at WisdomTree, a financial firm. “Sure, there was a significant revision to jobs growth in 2025. But that doesn’t really matter. That already happened and doesn’t tell us much about the current environment. For all the angst about the outlook for 2026, this should mitigate some of it.” Feb. 11, 2026, 9:51 a.m. ET Talmon Joseph Smith The only thing I would add to that reaction is that economists, including Mr. Rines, acknowledge that January is one of the noisier job reports because of the trickiness of making seasonal adjustments to payroll estimates right after the holidays.

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT The U.S. economy is growing, but not evenly. What began as an uneven rebound from the Covid-19 pandemic has hardened into what many economists describe as a “K-shaped” economy , in which higher-income households pull ahead while lower-income households fall further behind . High interest rates, rising costs and the rapid growth of artificial intelligence could deepen those divides, economists warn. “We are returning to a typical pattern of extremely high income inequality, and it now stands at a 60-year peak,” Beth Ann Bovino, chief economist at U.S. Bank, wrote in a recent report . “The worry is not just where we stand now, but also whether ongoing developments will worsen the situation.” The net worth of the top 1 percent of households climbed to a record share of nearly 32 percent of the national total in the third quarter of 2025, according to data from the Federal Reserve , which started tracking household wealth in 1989. Spending patterns have also split: Households earning under $75,000 a year are spending less on discretionary categories like travel and experiences than they did in 2019, while those making more than $150,000 are spending more, according to Bank of America Institute . Retail sales softened in December, data released on Tuesday showed, weighed down by a slight drop in purchases of vehicles and food. More executives are acknowledging the divide and its effects on their business. Delta Air Lines said in October that ticket sales for premium seats were expected to outpace those in the main cabin. The snack maker Mondelez said this month that consumers were “worried about overall affordability” and pulling back on snacking or shifting to value-store brands. “They are fed up with the price increases — they don’t feel good about their personal economic outlook,” Dirk Van de Put, chief executive of Mondelez, said during an earnings call. “And as a consequence, snacking is being affected.” Here is what some other companies have said about prices, spending and how the “K-shaped” economy is affecting their businesses: Chipotle: The fast-food chain is aiming to increase foot traffic and revenue amid weak comparable sales by focusing on higher-income consumers — a segment the company recently identified as its core audience, with 60 percent of customers from households earning above $100,000 on average. Clorox: The cleaning brand is adjusting pricing and product sizes to respond to pressure on all consumers but especially lower-income customers, Linda Rendle, the company’s chief executive, said on an earnings call this month. Clorox said shoppers were trading down to smaller packages at dollar stores or buying in bulk at club stores. Yum Brands: During its latest earnings call this month, Yum Brands, which owns Taco Bell and KFC, reported transaction growth across all income levels, with particularly notable gains among higher-income consumers in the last quarter. PayPal: The online payment company announced that it would no longer commit to the specific 2027 outlook presented at last year’s investor day. Instead, it plans to provide forecasts one year at a time, citing the influence of “macro factors and a K-shaped economy,” Jamie Miller, the company’s interim chief executive, said in a conference call this month. McDonald’s: The fast-food chain revived its “Extra Value Meal” combos as traffic from lower-income customers declined while visits from higher-income customers rose double digits. Chris Kempczinski, its chief executive, described the trend as a “two-tier economy.” Coca-Cola: The beverage company said in October that sales growth had been driven by higher-income consumers buying premium brands, while middle- and lower-income shoppers remain under pressure and more focused on value.

A crowd of anonymous online gamblers placing bets on Kalshi, a prediction site, expected to see 54,000 new jobs. The report ended up showing the U.S. economy had added 130,000 jobs at the start of the year. Both groups had missed the mark by a wide margin — and to similar degrees. Over the five years that Kalshi has existed , its thousands of gamblers have proved as accurate on average at predicting certain economic indicators as the highly trained forecasters, a working paper published last month by the National Bureau of Economic Research found. The crowd is also pretty good at predicting interest rate decisions from the Federal Reserve, and even better than the professionals at predicting the rate of inflation . “Getting information from a large pool of people can be a remarkably good form of forecasting,” said Jonathan Wright, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University who co-wrote the paper. Thomas Simons, a U.S. economist with Jefferies, the investment firm, took notice when Kevin Warsh was leading in the prediction markets to be President Trump’s nominee for chair of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Simons had dismissed the possibility because of Mr. Warsh’s past advocacy for higher interest rates , rather than the lower rates that Mr. Trump prefers. “‘How could it possibly be that he’s at the head of this? It doesn’t make any sense,’” Mr. Simons recalled thinking. But the markets turned out to be right , and he decided he shouldn’t disregard the odds. Bettors, he realized, have one advantage: They don’t have to make a prediction if they’re not highly confident that they’re right. Professional forecasters don’t have a choice; even if the data are confusing and they don’t have much conviction in the number, they guess. “You have to forecast these numbers every month even when you don’t necessarily think you have some kind of edge,” Mr. Simons said. “So it starts to make me feel like, if I go back to my priors on this, the people who have edge are the ones who are going to participate.” Another working paper , by economists at the London Business School and Yale University, found that Polymarket bettors as a whole forecast corporate earnings more accurately than the analysts who are paid to advise investors on whether to buy or sell. Theis Jensen, a Yale professor who worked on the paper, thinks the comparatively good performance by thousands of amateurs can be chalked up to incentives. Professional analysts may have conflicts of interest, such as their firm’s trading commissions, which might rise in response to rosier forecasts. Analysts may also avoid publishing earnings forecasts that are out of the norm, which can lead to more embarrassment than sticking with the crowd. “The nice thing about prediction markets is that you have to put your money where your mouth is,” Mr. Jensen said, “and so that highly incentivizes you to state your true beliefs.” Of course, that has been true for decades. The first online prediction markets emerged in the early 2000s. Sites like Intrade focused mostly on elections and the likelihood of other world events, and were generally found to be fairly accurate. In the 2010s, U.S. regulators cracked down, ruling that they were operating as illegal gambling platforms. But some platforms continued to operate in Europe, where political and economic contracts are a sideshow to enormous volumes of sports betting. The same is still true of Kalshi , which won a lawsuit allowing it to operate legally in 2024, and Polymarket , which is only sporadically accessible in the United States as lawsuits have blocked trading in many states. And yet betting volume even on nonsports questions has expanded at such a torrid pace that forecasters and analysts are taking notice. On any given day, more than $60 million is at stake on the platforms on political and economic questions — far more than the earlier platforms reached. Edward Ridgely runs Stand, a company that allows bettors to trade simultaneously on Kalshi and Polymarket and follow other large traders. He said many of his highest-volume customers worked in the same fields where they wagered. One user in Hong Kong buys and sells Nvidia stock in his day job and uses the tariff-related prediction market contracts as a hedge. “If the Trump tariffs escalate toward China or something, he can get out of his position and not get blown away,” Mr. Ridgely said. He sees another piece of evidence that bettors specialize: Most of them aren’t good at everything. “You can see that a lot of the traders who are really good at elections aren’t very good at crypto. Or if you’re really good at crypto, you’re not very good at geopolitics,” he said. Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist of J.P. Morgan, has access to a deep well of expertise from the bank’s political affairs staff, country specialists and equity researchers. But he still looks at the markets to get a more precise estimate. “Whenever you talk to D.C. people, they’ll say, ‘Well, I think they’ll get the budget done.’ So, what’s the probability?” Mr. Feroli said. “It’s a different language. Oftentimes you’ve got to really push to get a quantitative answer.” On the quantitative questions that are his stock in trade, like forecasting changes to the Consumer Price Index and gross domestic product, Mr. Feroli suspects something else is going on: The betting markets are just following the experts. That could mean monitoring the Bloomberg consensus, reading research from the big investment houses or tracking the futures markets and investor expectations that groups like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange already aggregate. Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University who studies forecasting, agrees that is likely. And therein lies a danger in prediction markets: If the crowd were to supplant professional forecasters, individual bettors would lose out. “They would be making the jobs of their contributors harder, because now they have individual sources of information to draw from,” Ms. Sinclair said. “If they replace all of that, then they won’t have those to also go to.” Most forecasters aren’t worried about that, because they do more than predict numbers. Every estimate comes with a detailed analysis of the factors underneath the headline number, which is what investors and companies need to figure out how to spend money. “Surprises happen, and people want to know, ‘What does this mean, what’s going to happen, what’s driving it?’” said Michael Pugliese, a U.S. economist with Wells Fargo. “I think that’s a lot of nuanced, important information that you’d want to have when you are making decisions, as an operator in these markets.” But prediction markets could become an input for some complex forecasts, like those constructed by the Federal Reserve. Justin Wolfers, an economics professor at the University of Michigan who studied and wrote about the earlier iterations of prediction markets, has told Fed officials that they should take those markets into consideration. They have been hesitant, he said. “There’s a deep problem, which is, if you were to do this, you democratize decision making,” Mr. Wolfers said. “Right now the senior economist has a ton of power. Their view goes.” It may also be true that neither individual experts nor a collective of thousands are the best at predicting the future. Over the past decade, a group called Good Judgment has developed a model of selecting people with good track records of figuring out what will happen. These “superforecasters” are applied to longer-range questions of interest to paying clients. They work collaboratively, but u",

      "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Strong monthly jobs growth and easing unemployment have pushed back expectations about when the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates again, suggesting the central bank is poised for an extended pause. Data released on Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed monthly jobs growth of 130,000 positions, almost double what economists had forecast, and the unemployment rate ticking down to 4.3 percent. That is down from a recent peak of 4.5 percent in January and slightly lower than December’s level. The unemployment rate has become a focal point for the Fed as it assesses the health of the labor market in the wake of immigration restrictions imposed by President Trump. The crackdown, which has led to a sharp slowdown of migration into the country, has decreased the supply of new workers available for hire. The number of new jobs the economy needs to keep the unemployment rate stable has dropped as a result, with research suggesting it could turn negative by this year. In 2024, the so-called monthly break-even rate was estimated to be well above 100,000 positions. Financial markets shifted sharply on Wednesday after the jobs report was released, with traders pushing back the timing of the next cut to July from June. “The window to see a material weakening in the labor market is probably closing,” said Stephen Juneau, an economist at Bank of America. “It seems like we have more momentum building in the economy rather than the reverse of that.” The Fed is trying to safeguard the labor market while also ensuring that rates are high enough for inflation to fall back to the central bank’s target of 2 percent. Price pressures have mounted as Mr. Trump’s tariffs have taken effect, although the overall impact has been more muted than initially expected. Officials at the Fed broadly expect the peak impact from those levies to hit in the first quarter of this year before inflation begins to decelerate again. January’s Consumer Price Index report, set to be released on Friday, will give policymakers insight into whether that forecast is bearing out. Economists expect annual inflation to tick down to 2.5 percent after a 0.3 percent increase in monthly prices. “Core” inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy items, is expected to stay sticky at 2.5 percent, only slightly lower than the previous 2.6 percent annual pace. But in a sign that labor-related price pressures remain muted, the employment cost index, a quarterly measure from the Labor Department that tracks changes in wages and benefits, unexpectedly slowed in the final three months of 2025. Economists at Evercore ISI said that data, which came out on Tuesday, confirmed their view that the “economy is cooling under the hood, even though we face up to another six months of elevated tariff pass-through.” Beyond the impact of tariffs, the Fed is also contending with the prospects of stronger growth in the coming quarters as Americans receive larger refunds as a result of Mr. Trump’s new tax cuts. The ongoing boom in artificial intelligence investments is also expected to fuel economic growth. Bank of America’s Mr. Juneau described the tax refunds as a “jolt for consumption over the next few months.” He said that, coupled with a likely easing of trade uncertainty ahead of the midterms, could imbue companies with the confidence to hire and invest more in the economy. “This year, with the midterms, you’re not going to see tariffs really ratcheted up again,” he said. At the Fed’s meeting just last month , Jerome H. Powell, the chair, struck a more upbeat tone about the economic outlook. He described the labor market as “stabilizing” after a period of weakness last year and noted that consumer spending and business fixed investment remained strong, even as Americans had grown less confident about the economy. “The economy has once again surprised us with its strength, not for the first time,” Mr. Powell said. That shift helped to justify the central bank’s decision at that meeting to pause rate cuts after a series of reductions last year. Between September and December, the Fed lowered rates by an aggregate three-quarters of a percentage point to a range of 3.5 percent to 3.75 percent. By the December meeting, the Fed’s policy decisions had become increasingly fraught, reflecting a fissure between policymakers over how to weigh concerns about the labor market versus inflation. Those divisions have lessened, but even January’s vote to hold rates steady was not unanimous. Stephen I. Miran, who has dissented at every meeting since he joined the Fed in September, voted in favor of a quarter-point cut. He was joined by Christopher J. Waller, a governor who was a finalist to replace Mr. Powell as chair when his term is up in May. A few days after that meeting, Mr. Trump tapped Kevin M. Warsh , a former Fed governor, for the job. In explaining his dissent, Mr. Waller said that revisions to the jobs data would likely show no growth in employment last year. “Zero. Zip. Nada,” Mr. Waller said in a statement. “This does not remotely look like a healthy labor market.” Further cuts appear to hinge on the labor market breaking out of its current “low hire, low fire” state and layoffs beginning to pick up in a more broad-based way, or inflation significantly slowing. Mr. Powell last month stopped short of signaling any timeline for future moves, reiterating that the central bank is “well positioned” for the moment and to address any economic challenges. He did, however, downplay the possibility of a rate increase this year. “We don’t take things off the table, but it isn’t anybody’s base case right now,” Mr. Powell said. Traders still expect rates to fall toward 3 percent by year-end, but to get there more slowly than before. Many officials believe that 3 percent rates would shift policy to a “neutral\" setting that neither stimulates nor restricts growth. Mr. Trump, who said his support of Mr. Warsh was contingent on his pushing for lower borrowing costs, has argued for rates to be closer to 1 percent. In a social media post on Wednesday after January’s report was released, the president again called for the country to be paying the lowest interest rate in the world and said it would lead to cost savings of at least $1 trillion a year related to payments to service the national debt. But the Fed does not take into consideration interest payments on the debt when setting policy. It is congressionally mandated to pursue low, stable inflation and a healthy labor market. “If you’re somewhat in the neutral camp and inflation is above target, then it’s harder for them to make the case to cut,” Priya Misra, a portfolio manager at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said of the Fed. “They need a clear emergency message from the labor market.” Colby Smith covers the Federal Reserve and the U.S. economy for The Times.
